Phenol/chloroform extraction of the resulting DNA increased measurement precision significantly in some experiments, presumably by removing proteins that interfered with DNA labeling and hybridization.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Affymetrix protocol!Sample_source_name_ch2 = normal tissue controls, Hapmap trios, Affymetrix!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue type: normal tissue controls, Hapmap trios, Affymetrix!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Affymetrix HapMap!Sample_label_ch2 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Affymetrix protocol!Sample_hyb_protocol = Affymetrix protocol!Sample_scan_protocol = Affymetrix protocol!Sample_description = SNP array data from GBM subcutaneous xenograft tumor tissue!Sample_data_processing = SNP array data was pre-processed as follows: PM probe intensities of the 21 GBMX tumors were quantile normalized with those of 90 normal tissue controls (Hapmap trios, Affymetrix). The total hybridization intensities, PMA+PMB (in logarithm base two), were median-summarized over the 5-7 probe quartets for each SNP, followed by a fragment length adjustment using cubic splines. We then calculated the log2 copy number (CN) ratio for each SNP by subtracting the mean SNP log2 intensity of all 90 Hapmap reference samples from the per-SNP intensity within each GBMX tumor to remove SNPspecific effects. CN was segmented along each chromosome into regions of equal copy number changes with a circular binary segmentation algorithm implemented in the DNAcopy package of R/Bioconductor, using the NCBI Build 36.1 annotation from Affymetrix (dated July 12, 2007). Neighboring genomic segments were merged if their estimated copy numbers did not differ by more than one standard deviation. Frequencies of CN gain or loss were calculated using segment mean thresholds of +/- 0.3. For analyses of GBM clinical specimens segment mean thresholds of +/- 0.3 were used on data generated 5 from SNP arrays, and thresholds of +/- 0.1 were used on data generated from BAC arrays, and Agilent 244K oligonucleotide arrays.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Graeme,,Hodgson!Sample_contact_email = ghodgson@cc.ucsf.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 415-476-3630!Sample_contact_fax = 415-476-8218!Sample_contact_department = Neurological Surgery!Sample_contact_institute = UCSF!Sample_contact_address = Box0808!Sample_contact_city = San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94143!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM370nnn/GSM370562/suppl/GSM370562.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14804!Sample_series_id = GSE14806!Sample_data_row_count = 58624#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 copy number ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1677174	1.073SNP_A-1678466	2.261SNP_A-1676440	5.116SNP_A-1662392	2.248SNP_A-1685736	1.992SNP_A-1681384	0.397SNP_A-1642581	-1.609SNP_A-1669029	0.293SNP_A-1718237	0.101SNP_A-1748467	1.127SNP_A-1705537	0.024SNP_A-1683756	0.575SNP_A-1696782	-0.253SNP_A-1673422	1.385SNP_A-1670878	-1.247SNP_A-1743511	-1.186SNP_A-1736635	1.129SNP_A-1666738	-1.279SNP_A-1721407	2.374SNP_A-1686722	1.77!sample_table_end
