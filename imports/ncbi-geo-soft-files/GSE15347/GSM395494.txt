Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758. The data matrix contains the normalized expression values produced by that algorithm.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Guangchun,,Song!Sample_contact_email = guangchun.song@stjude.org!Sample_contact_phone = 901-595-6302!Sample_contact_laboratory = Downing!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = St Jude Children's Research Hospital!Sample_contact_address = 262 Danny Thomas Place!Sample_contact_city = Memphis!Sample_contact_state = TN!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 38105!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM395nnn/GSM395494/suppl/GSM395494.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM395nnn/GSM395494/suppl/GSM395494.CHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15347!Sample_series_id = GSE15732!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotypes: AA, AB, BB, No Call#CONFIDENCE = #RAS1 = Relative allele signal for the data in the first probe group#RAS2 = Relative allele signal for the data in the second probe group#P-VALUE AA = #P-VALUE AB = #P-VALUE BB = #P-VALUE NO CALL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	RAS1	RAS2	P-VALUE AA	P-VALUE AB	P-VALUE BB	P-VALUE NO CALLAFFX-5Q-123	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-456	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-789	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-ABC	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeA	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeB	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeC	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeD	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeE	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeF	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeG	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeH	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeI	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeJ	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeK	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeL	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeM	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeN	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeO	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeP	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0!sample_table_end
