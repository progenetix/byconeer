For copy number, CEL files were analysed using the arome.affymetrix R package. All probes from each allele were combined in one value per probeset (SNP or CN). Segmentation was done using the Rseg R package.!Sample_data_processing = The log2 ratio was calculated as the log2 ratio between the theta estimates from the tumor sample and the theta estimates from the blood sample from the same patient for chromosomes 1 to 22 and chromosome X.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Philippe,,Lamy!Sample_contact_email = PHILIPPE.LAMY@SVF.AU.DK!Sample_contact_department = Department of molecular medecine!Sample_contact_institute = MOMA!Sample_contact_address = BrendstrupgÃ¥rdsvej 100!Sample_contact_city = Aarhus N!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8200!Sample_contact_country = Denmark!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1226nnn/GSM1226031/suppl/GSM1226031_A532-066.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1226nnn/GSM1226031/suppl/GSM1226031_A532-066.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE50667!Sample_series_id = GSE50668!Sample_data_row_count = 909622
