The log2ratio of Cy5 (tumor) to Cy3 (Control) was normalized by the Centralization Algorithm in DNA Analytics. Aberrant regions were determined by the ADM-2 algorithm at a threshold of 12.0 in DNA Analytics. To detect gains and losses, we set the values of parameters for aberration filters as: minimum number of probes in region 2, minimum absolute average log2ratio for region 0.263034, maximum number of aberrant regions 10000, and percentage penetrance per feature 0. We set the value of the minimum absolute average log2ratio at 0.263034 to detect regions showing a change in the averaged copy number equal to or more than 1.2-fold (log2(1.2)=0.263034).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8841!Sample_contact_name = Yoshiyuki,,Tsukamoto!Sample_contact_email = tuka@oita-u.ac.jp!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Oita university, Faculty of Medicine!Sample_contact_address = hasamacho idaigaoka 1-1!Sample_contact_city = Yufu-city!Sample_contact_state = Oita!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 879-5593!Sample_contact_country = Japan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM659nnn/GSM659234/suppl/GSM659234.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26800!Sample_data_row_count = 42415#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2ratio of Cy5 (tumor) to Cy3 (Control)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_14_P112718	0.98863137A_14_P201353	-0.76819795A_14_P108353	0.77439713A_14_P129881	-0.21874961A_14_P114030	0.13901508A_14_P139527	-1.268954A_14_P118340	-0.49719238A_14_P106890	-0.047604382A_14_P122641	-0.92910206A_14_P107170	-0.54560125A_14_P100766	0.058945417A_14_P118104	-0.024086952A_14_P117253	-0.8357346A_14_P129407	-1.3349401A_14_P200001	-1.7169003A_14_P103811	0.010509878A_14_P119666	0.0657855A_14_P100799	-0.36646855A_14_P121179	-0.08975057A_14_P115318	-1.1980016!sample_table_end
