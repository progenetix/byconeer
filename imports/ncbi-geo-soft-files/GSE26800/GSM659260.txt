The log2ratio of Cy5 (tumor) to Cy3 (Control) was normalized by the Centralization Algorithm in DNA Analytics. Aberrant regions were determined by the ADM-2 algorithm at a threshold of 12.0 in DNA Analytics. To detect gains and losses, we set the values of parameters for aberration filters as: minimum number of probes in region 2, minimum absolute average log2ratio for region 0.263034, maximum number of aberrant regions 10000, and percentage penetrance per feature 0. We set the value of the minimum absolute average log2ratio at 0.263034 to detect regions showing a change in the averaged copy number equal to or more than 1.2-fold (log2(1.2)=0.263034).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8841!Sample_contact_name = Yoshiyuki,,Tsukamoto!Sample_contact_email = tuka@oita-u.ac.jp!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Oita university, Faculty of Medicine!Sample_contact_address = hasamacho idaigaoka 1-1!Sample_contact_city = Yufu-city!Sample_contact_state = Oita!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 879-5593!Sample_contact_country = Japan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM659nnn/GSM659260/suppl/GSM659260.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26800!Sample_data_row_count = 42415#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2ratio of Cy5 (tumor) to Cy3 (Control)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_14_P112718	-0.7070128A_14_P201353	-1.0218847A_14_P108353	-0.5103946A_14_P129881	-0.4859367A_14_P114030	0.2959815A_14_P139527	-0.23563011A_14_P118340	0.30985203A_14_P106890	0.1479026A_14_P122641	0.12094027A_14_P107170	0.052689552A_14_P100766	-0.16461286A_14_P118104	-0.16578549A_14_P117253	0.07776652A_14_P129407	0.24995196A_14_P200001	-0.038116284A_14_P103811	-0.15857063A_14_P119666	0.17909719A_14_P100799	-0.01906005A_14_P121179	-0.23379262A_14_P115318	0.001341181!sample_table_end
