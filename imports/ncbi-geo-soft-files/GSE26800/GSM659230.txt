The log2ratio of Cy5 (tumor) to Cy3 (Control) was normalized by the Centralization Algorithm in DNA Analytics. Aberrant regions were determined by the ADM-2 algorithm at a threshold of 12.0 in DNA Analytics. To detect gains and losses, we set the values of parameters for aberration filters as: minimum number of probes in region 2, minimum absolute average log2ratio for region 0.263034, maximum number of aberrant regions 10000, and percentage penetrance per feature 0. We set the value of the minimum absolute average log2ratio at 0.263034 to detect regions showing a change in the averaged copy number equal to or more than 1.2-fold (log2(1.2)=0.263034).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8841!Sample_contact_name = Yoshiyuki,,Tsukamoto!Sample_contact_email = tuka@oita-u.ac.jp!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Oita university, Faculty of Medicine!Sample_contact_address = hasamacho idaigaoka 1-1!Sample_contact_city = Yufu-city!Sample_contact_state = Oita!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 879-5593!Sample_contact_country = Japan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM659nnn/GSM659230/suppl/GSM659230.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26800!Sample_data_row_count = 42415#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2ratio of Cy5 (tumor) to Cy3 (Control)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_14_P112718	-0.18446735A_14_P201353	-1.397324A_14_P108353	0.03968232A_14_P129881	0.050218605A_14_P114030	-0.19206311A_14_P139527	-0.08065909A_14_P118340	-0.15606199A_14_P106890	0.32393193A_14_P122641	0.416324A_14_P107170	0.46604395A_14_P100766	0.38916016A_14_P118104	0.040978946A_14_P117253	-0.07481377A_14_P129407	-0.027729172A_14_P200001	-0.23774552A_14_P103811	-0.11504312A_14_P119666	-0.0990279A_14_P100799	0.29813018A_14_P121179	-0.09864637A_14_P115318	-0.12584867!sample_table_end
