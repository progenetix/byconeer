Procedures of washing and scanning of SNP 6.0 chips followed the manuals provided by Affymetrix, Inc.!Sample_scan_protocol = The hybridized chips were scanned by 7G Affymetrix scanner.!Sample_description = Affymetrix SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files were analyzed with Genotyping Console for quality control analysis. Samples with QC call above 80% and QC contrast ratio above 0.4 were admitted into the analysis. To analyze CNV, CEL files were imported into Partek GenomeSuite 6.6 to generate copy number from raw intensity.!Sample_data_processing = Each CEL file represents data from one patient. Deletion or amplification of genomes were analyzed by first limiting to the regions with p-value less than 0.001. The selected regions were subsequently filtered by limiting to the regions with at least 10 markers and 2 kb in size.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Shuchang,,Liu!Sample_contact_email = silvia.shuchang.liu@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = University of Pittsburgh!Sample_contact_address = 130 De Soto Street!Sample_contact_city = Pittsburgh!Sample_contact_state = Pennsylvania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 15261!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1815nnn/GSM1815630/suppl/GSM1815630_Yu_SNP_101027_IB684B.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE70650!Sample_data_row_count = 0
