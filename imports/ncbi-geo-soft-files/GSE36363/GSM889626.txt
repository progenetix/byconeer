PMID: 19535535), converted to log2 values, sample-wise median centered, and divided by the mean of normal samples to make CN values.  CN values were smoothed by circular binary segmentation, sample-wise median centered using autosomes. Finally, CN values were standardized by dividing each sample by its standard deviation. Sex chromosomes were not used in final analysis, so these probesets have NULL for all samples.  SNP6 data were subjected to a within-sample outlier removal process (TCGA Research Network, PMID: 21720365), and struck probesets have 'NULL' values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Matthew,D,Wilkerson!Sample_contact_email = mwilkers@med.unc.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 919-966-3864!Sample_contact_fax = 919-966-8212!Sample_contact_laboratory = D.
