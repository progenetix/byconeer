The pellet is resuspended in35 micro liter of hybridization solution (50% Formamide, 10% Dextran sulfate, 4% SDS and 2xSSC). The hybridization is performed under a cover slip in a humid chamber at 37 degree for 48 hours.!Sample_scan_protocol = Agilent Scanner!Sample_description = Human Breast cell line!Sample_data_processing = IPLab/DeArray!Sample_platform_id = GPL4615!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Pan!Sample_contact_email = cpan@mail.nih.gov!Sample_contact_department = NHGRI!Sample_contact_institute = NIH!Sample_contact_address = Rm 5228, Bldg 50, South Dr.!Sample_contact_city = Bethesda!Sample_contact_state = MD!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20892!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM149nnn/GSM149987/suppl/GSM149987.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE6567!Sample_data_row_count = 5760
