Breast cancer cell lines SKBR3, MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-361 were cultured in DMEM (PAN-Biotech) medium supplemented with 10% FCS (PAN-Biotech), 2mM L-Glutamic acid (PAN-Biotech) and  1% PEN STREP (PAN-Biotech). BT-474 was grwon in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 2mM L-Glutamic acid, 1% P/S and 1mM sodium pyruvate.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Total genomic DNA (bulk DNA) was extracted using the Dbeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAgen) following manufacture's instructions.

Briefly, 1.5 - 2.0 Âµg of the purified input DNA (WGA product or unamplified genomic DNA) was supplemented with 5 Âµl of Random Primer Mix and filled up with H2O to 31 Âµl. Unamplified DNA and WGA products samples were denatured at 95â¦C for 10 or 3 minutes, respectively. Sample tubes were transferred on ice and incubated for 5 min. The labeling reaction with exo-Klenow fragment consisted of the following ingredients: 31 Âµl of denatured DNA, 10 Âµl of 5x Reaction Buffer, 5.0 Âµl of 10x dNTP Mix, 3.0 Âµl of Cy5-dUTP (test) or Cy3-dUTP (reference) and 1.0 Âµl of Exo(-) Klenow fragment. Labeling reaction was run at 37â¦C for two hours, followed by an inactivation step at 65â¦C for 10 minutes. Labeled DNA was purified using Ultra 0.5 purification system with a size cut-off of 30 kDa. DNA yields and dye incorporation rates were quantified using the NanoDrop ND-1000 instrument.!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = PCR-based labeling using dye-conjugated universal primer (PCR-T1):!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Placement of the dye on the universal primer provides the advantage that all restriction digestion fragments present in the WGA product irrespectively of their size will be labeled with the same amount of dye. To avoid cross-hybridization of adapter sequences flanking amplicons in the WGA products, test and reference samples were labeled using different PCR-adapters. Test samples were labeled with the PCR-adapter incorporated in the Ampli1â¢ WGA kit, while all the reference DNA samples were amplified using the following adapters: MIB5 (5â-TGAGCTGGTCATTGCGCATGGT-3â) and ddMse XI (5â-TAACCATGCGC-3â). Universal primers used in the labeling reaction were directly conjugated with either Cy5 in the case of Ampli1â¢ universal primer [5â-TAGTGGGATTCCTGCTGTCAGT-3â] or Cy3 in the cases of MIB5 primer [5â-TGAGCTGGTCATTGCGCATGGT-3â] (underscores indicate the placement of the dye). The labeling PCR was run in a total volume of 50 Âµl reaction composed of 5 Âµl of 10x Expanded Long Template Buffer 1 (Roche Diagnostics), 2.4 ÂµM of dye-conjugated LIB1 or MIB5 primer (for test and reference sample, respectively), 350 ÂµM of dNTPs, 0.5 Âµl BSA (Roche), 3.75 U of Expand-Long-Template DNA Polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) and 1.0 Âµl of the template DNA. The PCR was programmed as follows: 10 cycle of 94â¦C for 15 sec, 51â¦C for 30 sec and 65â¦C for 3:30 min, 2 cycles of 94â¦C for 15 sec, 51â¦C for 30 sec and 65â¦C for 3:30 min (extended by 10 sec every cycle), followed by a final elongation step of 7 min at 65â¦C. Products were purified using the Amicon Ultra 0.5 System (cut-off size 100 kDa) and quantified with the NanoDrop ND-1000 instrument.!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = PCR-based labeling using incorporation of dye-conjugated dNTPs (PCR-T2):!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = WGA products were labeled by PCR in the presence of Cy5 or Cy3 conjugated dCTP and dUTP. Incorporation of the fluorescent dyes using the dNTPs provided the advantage that adapters flanking each amplicon in the WGA product could be removed prior to aCGH hybridization, thereby avoiding unspecific cross-hybridization of test sample with reference DNA and oligonucleotide probes on the array. For each sample two 50Âµl PCR reactions were run in parallel each comprising 5 Âµl of 10x Expanded Long Template Buffer 1 (Roche Diagnostics), 2.4 ÂµM of the universal primer (LIB1 or MseLig-21, depending on the adapter sequence incorporated in the WGA product), 350 ÂµM of dATP and dGTP, 315 ÂµM of dCTP and dTTP, 35 ÂµM of Cy5/Cy3-dCTP and Cy5/Cy3-dUTP (GE Healthcare), 0.5 Âµl of BSA (Roche Diagnostics), 7.5 U of Expand-Long-Template DNA Polymerase (Roche) and 0.5 Âµl of the template DNA.

For each hybridization 100 Âµl of the hybridization mix was applied on the array and hybridized at 65â¦C for 24 h. Following the hybridization, the slides were washed sequentially: twice for 2:30 min in Oligo aCGH/ChIP-on-Chip Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent Technologies) at room temperature, twice for 30 sec min in Oligo aCGH/ChIP-on-Chip Wash Buffer 2 (Agilent Technologies) at 37â¦C. Washed slides were immersed in acetonitrile to remove all remaining traces of the wash buffers.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Agilent G2565CA scanner (Dye channel: R+G; Scan resolution: 2.5Âµm, double pass; Tiff file dynamic range: 16 Bit; Red PMT gain: 100%; Green PMT gain: 100%; No XDR)!Sample_description = BT-474 genomic DNA; single-cell WGA; reamplified WGA (25 probes)!Sample_description = Raw data file:!Sample_description = US94700331_252206026397_S01_CGH_107_Sep09_1_4.txt!Sample_description = BT-474_reamplified single-cell WGA_PCR-T2!Sample_description = samples used to assess the accuracy of the single-cell aCGH protocol in terms of quantitative assessment of CNAs.

The resulting text files were imported and analyzed with Agilent Genomic Workbench Software (version 6.5.0.18 Lite). Aberrant regions were recognized using ADM-2 algorithm with threshold set to 6.5. Centralization algorithm was set to a threshold of 6.0 and bin size of 10. To avoid false positive calls, aberration filters were applied to define the minimum log2 ratio (minimum absolute average log ratio for region = 0.3) and the minimum number of probes in an aberrant interval (minimum number of probes in region = 10 for unamplified DNA and freshly picked cells or minimum number of probes in region = 25 for WGA products generated with immunostained cells and FFPE samples).  The log2 ratios were obtained using the Agilent Genomic Workbench 6.5.0.18.!Sample_platform_id = GPL10150!Sample_contact_name = Zbigniew,Tadeusz,Czyz!Sample_contact_email = zbigniew.czyz@klinik.uni-regensburg.de!Sample_contact_department = Project Group Personalized Tumor Therapy, Regensburg!Sample_contact_institute = Fraunhofer Institute for Toxicology and Experimental Medicine!Sample_contact_address = Josef-Engert-Strasse 9!Sample_contact_city = Regensburg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 93053!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE52366!Sample_data_row_count = 173063
