GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the AffymetrixGeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = DNA extracted from patient i16024 germline cells.!Sample_data_processing = CEL files and birdseed-v2.txt files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the Birdseed v2 algorithm) were processed by dChip and model-based expression was performed using the PM/MM model. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St. Jude and described in Pounds et al. Bioinformatics. 2009 Feb 1;25(3):315-21 (PMID 19052058). The Sample data table contains the normalized expression values produced by that algorithm and genotyping calls.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Guangchun,,Song!Sample_contact_email = guangchun.song@stjude.org!Sample_contact_phone = 901-595-6302!Sample_contact_laboratory = Downing!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = St Jude Children's Research Hospital!Sample_contact_address = 262 Danny Thomas Place!Sample_contact_city = Memphis!Sample_contact_state = TN!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 38105!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM807nnn/GSM807584/suppl/GSM807584.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE32462!Sample_data_row_count = 1876468#ID_REF = #VALUE = Summarized signal#Call = Genotype call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, and NoCall!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CallCN_473963	148	NoCallCN_473964	3394	NoCallCN_473965	1091	NoCallCN_477984	2819	NoCallCN_473981	123	NoCallCN_473982	189	NoCallCN_497980	553	NoCallCN_497981	270	NoCallCN_513369	71	NoCallCN_513370	2709	NoCallCN_517762	83	NoCallCN_517763	4405	NoCallCN_502615	89	NoCallCN_502613	490	NoCallCN_502614	117	NoCallCN_502616	84	NoCallCN_502842	238	NoCallCN_502843	337	NoCallCN_466171	519	NoCallCN_466172	363	NoCall!sample_table_end
