Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St. Jude and described in Pounds et al. Bioinformatics. 2009 Feb 1;25(3):315-21 (PMID 19052058). The Sample data table contains the normalized expression values produced by that algorithm and genotyping calls.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Guangchun,,Song!Sample_contact_email = guangchun.song@stjude.org!Sample_contact_phone = 901-595-6302!Sample_contact_laboratory = Downing!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = St Jude Children's Research Hospital!Sample_contact_address = 262 Danny Thomas Place!Sample_contact_city = Memphis!Sample_contact_state = TN!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 38105!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM808nnn/GSM808057/suppl/GSM808057.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE32462!Sample_data_row_count = 1876468#ID_REF = #VALUE = Summarized signal#Call = Genotype call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, and NoCall!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CallCN_473963	75	NoCallCN_473964	652	NoCallCN_473965	321	NoCallCN_477984	469	NoCallCN_473981	40	NoCallCN_473982	91	NoCallCN_497980	1210	NoCallCN_497981	1438	NoCallCN_513369	35	NoCallCN_513370	793	NoCallCN_517762	36	NoCallCN_517763	3323	NoCallCN_502615	46	NoCallCN_502613	843	NoCallCN_502614	89	NoCallCN_502616	9	NoCallCN_502842	265	NoCallCN_502843	629	NoCallCN_466171	417	NoCallCN_466172	197	NoCall!sample_table_end
