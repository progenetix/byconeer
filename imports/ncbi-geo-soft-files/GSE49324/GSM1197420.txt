Hybridization was carried out at 65Â°C for 40 hours, in a rotating oven at 20 rpm.!Sample_scan_protocol = CGH-v4_95. Feature extraction v.9.5!Sample_data_processing = The data quality of each microarray was assessed using the Quality Metrics report generated by the Agilent CGH analytics software (v.3.4).  Copy number aberrations were detected using the Aberration Detection Method (ADM-1) algorithm, based on computing significance scores for all genomic intervals. Before calling any aberration the log ratios are normalized  by subtracting the expected average Âµ from all log ratios vi, and then these modified log ratios are divided by the estimated variance Ï. This transforms the log ratio scores into a normal distribution with a mean of 0 under the null model assumption.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9777!Sample_contact_name = Ramakrishna,,Sompallae!Sample_contact_email = ramakrishnas@gmail.com!Sample_contact_phone = 319 353 5548!Sample_contact_laboratory = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_department = Iowa Institute of Human Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = University of Iowa!Sample_contact_address = 285 Newton Road, 5292 CBRB!Sample_contact_city = Iowa City!Sample_contact_state = IA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 52240!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE49324!Sample_series_id = GSE49327!Sample_data_row_count = 415056#ID_REF = #VALUE = Lowess normalized log2 tumor/normal ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE4	-0.1647620331674965	-0.0982769745411786	-1.737839090241187	-0.2534501827026048	-0.3211024893941029	-0.062283143274958910	-0.40341989120431911	0.15769548577806412	-0.56284493685182913	-0.23860600675879514	-0.49028304928371415	-0.17220214648597116	-1.1292043105213817	-1.0272067323987218	-1.7530439398107519	-0.14229738759261320	-0.59322414899588421	-0.48558134838883122	0.35750842922686523	-0.044844593809411!sample_table_end
