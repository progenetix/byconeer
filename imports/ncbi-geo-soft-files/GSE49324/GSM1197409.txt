Hybridization was carried out at 65Â°C for 40 hours, in a rotating oven at 20 rpm.!Sample_scan_protocol = CGH-v4_95. Feature extraction v.9.5!Sample_data_processing = The data quality of each microarray was assessed using the Quality Metrics report generated by the Agilent CGH analytics software (v.3.4).  Copy number aberrations were detected using the Aberration Detection Method (ADM-1) algorithm, based on computing significance scores for all genomic intervals. Before calling any aberration the log ratios are normalized  by subtracting the expected average Âµ from all log ratios vi, and then these modified log ratios are divided by the estimated variance Ï. This transforms the log ratio scores into a normal distribution with a mean of 0 under the null model assumption.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9777!Sample_contact_name = Ramakrishna,,Sompallae!Sample_contact_email = ramakrishnas@gmail.com!Sample_contact_phone = 319 353 5548!Sample_contact_laboratory = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_department = Iowa Institute of Human Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = University of Iowa!Sample_contact_address = 285 Newton Road, 5292 CBRB!Sample_contact_city = Iowa City!Sample_contact_state = IA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 52240!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE49324!Sample_series_id = GSE49327!Sample_data_row_count = 415056#ID_REF = #VALUE = Lowess normalized log2 tumor/normal ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE4	-0.08723256561884885	-0.3918487130819636	0.108247741352577	-0.3152976732124268	0.05715197557656069	-0.1506998799569410	0.13100818130436811	0.15607882336232512	0.24757723470584213	0.29469073616511514	-0.73395097924600615	-0.1488184357548416	0.37161342594200817	0.099778087574792118	-0.06167130138992119	-0.56420352305882220	0.44059784244241621	-0.043931334984842422	-0.28234042455646723	-0.38248428581357!sample_table_end
