Hybridization was carried out at 65Â°C for 40 hours, in a rotating oven at 20 rpm.!Sample_scan_protocol = CGH-v4_95. Feature extraction v.9.5!Sample_data_processing = The data quality of each microarray was assessed using the Quality Metrics report generated by the Agilent CGH analytics software (v.3.4).  Copy number aberrations were detected using the Aberration Detection Method (ADM-1) algorithm, based on computing significance scores for all genomic intervals. Before calling any aberration the log ratios are normalized  by subtracting the expected average Âµ from all log ratios vi, and then these modified log ratios are divided by the estimated variance Ï. This transforms the log ratio scores into a normal distribution with a mean of 0 under the null model assumption.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9777!Sample_contact_name = Ramakrishna,,Sompallae!Sample_contact_email = ramakrishnas@gmail.com!Sample_contact_phone = 319 353 5548!Sample_contact_laboratory = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_department = Iowa Institute of Human Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = University of Iowa!Sample_contact_address = 285 Newton Road, 5292 CBRB!Sample_contact_city = Iowa City!Sample_contact_state = IA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 52240!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE49324!Sample_series_id = GSE49327!Sample_data_row_count = 415056#ID_REF = #VALUE = Lowess normalized log2 tumor/normal ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE4	-0.1124588320022045	1.097885893301186	-0.823522206992027	0.185691749377688	0.1145177751936729	-0.22121692352656110	0.32588528725723311	-0.29200842283544512	-0.028562666092576313	-0.23967484007984114	-0.33696762170248115	0.13793699776798816	0.15160304221291417	-0.59006909961980818	-1.0219601618816719	-0.39147217784749320	0.21533710425441221	0.52016538469736222	0.5753091306333323	-0.270218575396714!sample_table_end
