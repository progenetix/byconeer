Hybridization was carried out at 65Â°C for 40 hours, in a rotating oven at 20 rpm.!Sample_scan_protocol = CGH-v4_95. Feature extraction v.9.5!Sample_data_processing = The data quality of each microarray was assessed using the Quality Metrics report generated by the Agilent CGH analytics software (v.3.4).  Copy number aberrations were detected using the Aberration Detection Method (ADM-1) algorithm, based on computing significance scores for all genomic intervals. Before calling any aberration the log ratios are normalized  by subtracting the expected average Âµ from all log ratios vi, and then these modified log ratios are divided by the estimated variance Ï. This transforms the log ratio scores into a normal distribution with a mean of 0 under the null model assumption.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9777!Sample_contact_name = Ramakrishna,,Sompallae!Sample_contact_email = ramakrishnas@gmail.com!Sample_contact_phone = 319 353 5548!Sample_contact_laboratory = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_department = Iowa Institute of Human Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = University of Iowa!Sample_contact_address = 285 Newton Road, 5292 CBRB!Sample_contact_city = Iowa City!Sample_contact_state = IA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 52240!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE49324!Sample_series_id = GSE49327!Sample_data_row_count = 415056#ID_REF = #VALUE = Lowess normalized log2 tumor/normal ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE4	-0.4157680972088445	-0.9237326382929356	-2.449550935857887	-1.213004146296418	-1.014139061546449	-0.35153656786456210	-1.1468999796464811	-0.3711122273831512	-0.35223244237214413	-0.75487203824582114	-0.82965160049624615	-0.17095518254414816	-1.2757191971947717	-1.0435381049224418	-2.2582192791139819	-0.29163370918024520	-0.23981453659050721	-0.59571613587694422	-0.19878515148635123	0.0536438449078189!sample_table_end
