Hybridization was carried out at 65Â°C for 40 hours, in a rotating oven at 20 rpm.!Sample_scan_protocol = CGH-v4_95. Feature extraction v.9.5!Sample_data_processing = The data quality of each microarray was assessed using the Quality Metrics report generated by the Agilent CGH analytics software (v.3.4).  Copy number aberrations were detected using the Aberration Detection Method (ADM-1) algorithm, based on computing significance scores for all genomic intervals. Before calling any aberration the log ratios are normalized  by subtracting the expected average Âµ from all log ratios vi, and then these modified log ratios are divided by the estimated variance Ï. This transforms the log ratio scores into a normal distribution with a mean of 0 under the null model assumption.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9777!Sample_contact_name = Ramakrishna,,Sompallae!Sample_contact_email = ramakrishnas@gmail.com!Sample_contact_phone = 319 353 5548!Sample_contact_laboratory = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_department = Iowa Institute of Human Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = University of Iowa!Sample_contact_address = 285 Newton Road, 5292 CBRB!Sample_contact_city = Iowa City!Sample_contact_state = IA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 52240!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE49324!Sample_series_id = GSE49327!Sample_data_row_count = 415056#ID_REF = #VALUE = Lowess normalized log2 tumor/normal ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE4	-0.05243152342737965	0.4544822983444976	-0.9000028562018057	0.1390871740460578	-0.2467196476091459	-0.263628720901910	-0.30099980212982411	0.14910518375750912	-0.14523492150198113	-0.4213226606214114	-0.098095011279081215	-0.10979575532696616	-1.1765000780697217	-1.3618148231234618	-2.1824850203079319	-0.36025268133429420	-0.22298528856548721	0.24400617412887522	-0.22660367641948623	-0.687543427170718!sample_table_end
