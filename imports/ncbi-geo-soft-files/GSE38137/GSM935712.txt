Labeling reactions were performed using a Genomic DNA Enzymatic Labeling Kit (Agilent), according to the manufacturerâs recommendations. DNA was digested by AluI and RsaI in the presence of BSA for 2 hours at +37Â°C. After efficient fragmentation was confirmed by E-GelÂ® Agarose Gel Electrophoresis (Invitrogen), fragments were heat-denatured, random primers (Agilent) were annealed to them, and extended with help of the Exo-Klenow fragment in the presence of dNTP, Cyanine 5-dUTP and Cyanine 3-dUTP for samples and reference, respectively (all reagents from Agilent). Amplicons were purified on Amicon 30kDa filters (Agilent) and labeling efficiency was checked by assessing specific activity of Cy5 (A650) or Cy3 (A550) relative to the amount of DNA (A260) using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Nanodrop).!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Melanoma cells in culture!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = sample type: Random!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = patient id: 3!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = lesion id: 3!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = date of isolation: N/A!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = origin: Surgery Branch, NIH, Bethesda, USA!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = originator's sample label: 1182!Sample_growth_protocol_ch2 = After surgical removal, stable cell cultures were established and maintained in IMDM (Gibco) supplemented by 10% Human Serum AB (Gemini)!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Total genomic DNA was isolated from 2x106 cells per sample by automated sample processing using the QuickGene DNA whole blood kit S and a QuickGene-810 Nucleic Acid Isolation System (Fujifilm), following the manufacturerâs instructions.

Human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen), Blocking Agent (Agilent), and Agilent1s 2X Hi-RPM Buffer were added to all samples, and hybridized to 105K Human Genome CGH 105A Oligo Microarrays (Agilent). Hybridization was done for 40 hours at +65Â°C, 20 rpm in a Microarray Hybridization Oven (Agilent). Arrays were washed with Oligo aCGH Wash Buffers (Agilent).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned in a High-Resolution Microarray Scanner (Agilent). Raw data retrieval was performed using Agilentâs Feature Extraction software.!Sample_description = Sporadic melanoma isolated from patient 3!Sample_data_processing = Agilent aCGH data obtained from microarray analysis were imported into the Partek Genomics Suite software (Partek), quantile normalized, converted into copy number values and pre-processed using its built-in segmentation algorithm. Individual chromosomal segments were defined as continuous regions covered by at least 10 consecutive microarray probes, a significant (p<0.001) and considerable (>0.3 copies on average) difference between the copy number (CN) of the given segment and neighboring segments, accepting an error rate of  less than +/- 0.3 copies!Sample_platform_id = GPL9075!Sample_contact_name = Zoltan,,Pos!Sample_contact_email = pos_zoltan@yahoo.com!Sample_contact_phone = +(36)12102930-56435!Sample_contact_department = Dept. of Genetics, Cell- and Immunobiology!Sample_contact_institute = Semmelweis University!Sample_contact_address = 4 Nagyvarad ter!Sample_contact_city = Budapest!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = H-1089!Sample_contact_country = Hungary!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM935nnn/GSM935712/suppl/GSM935712_Mel_1182_CGH-v4_95.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38137!Sample_series_id = GSE38187!Sample_data_row_count = 99026#ID_REF = #VALUE = DNA copy numbers of Ch2 sample (metastatic melanoma) based on log2 ratio data for both channels!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P17404356	1.27554A_16_P17833431	2.35685A_14_P106953	1.18251A_16_P15853500	1.02968A_16_P38942937	1.12453A_14_P112424	2.5242A_14_P116868	1.36288A_14_P138704	2.36946A_16_P21423927	1.07454A_16_P35227232	1.87505A_16_P36411830	1.81465A_16_P16287796	1.69409A_14_P102903	1.05176A_14_P139398	0.630169A_16_P36316917	1.26248A_16_P18016009	1.87279A_16_P02763505	3.89058A_16_P20905138	0.83783A_14_P111822	1.04364A_14_P101811	3.27341!sample_table_end
