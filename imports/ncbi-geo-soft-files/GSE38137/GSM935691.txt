Labeling reactions were performed using a Genomic DNA Enzymatic Labeling Kit (Agilent), according to the manufacturerâs recommendations. DNA was digested by AluI and RsaI in the presence of BSA for 2 hours at +37Â°C. After efficient fragmentation was confirmed by E-GelÂ® Agarose Gel Electrophoresis (Invitrogen), fragments were heat-denatured, random primers (Agilent) were annealed to them, and extended with help of the Exo-Klenow fragment in the presence of dNTP, Cyanine 5-dUTP and Cyanine 3-dUTP for samples and reference, respectively (all reagents from Agilent). Amplicons were purified on Amicon 30kDa filters (Agilent) and labeling efficiency was checked by assessing specific activity of Cy5 (A650) or Cy3 (A550) relative to the amount of DNA (A260) using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Nanodrop).!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Melanoma cells in culture!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = sample type: Recurrent!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = patient id: B!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = lesion id: B/1!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = date of isolation: 9/1/1999!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = origin: CRO, Aviano, Italy!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = originator's sample label: 140 IV 6p!Sample_growth_protocol_ch2 = After surgical removal, stable cell cultures were established and maintained in IMDM (Gibco) supplemented by 10% Human Serum AB (Gemini)!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Total genomic DNA was isolated from 2x106 cells per sample by automated sample processing using the QuickGene DNA whole blood kit S and a QuickGene-810 Nucleic Acid Isolation System (Fujifilm), following the manufacturerâs instructions.

Human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen), Blocking Agent (Agilent), and Agilent1s 2X Hi-RPM Buffer were added to all samples, and hybridized to 105K Human Genome CGH 105A Oligo Microarrays (Agilent). Hybridization was done for 40 hours at +65Â°C, 20 rpm in a Microarray Hybridization Oven (Agilent). Arrays were washed with Oligo aCGH Wash Buffers (Agilent).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned in a High-Resolution Microarray Scanner (Agilent). Raw data retrieval was performed using Agilentâs Feature Extraction software.!Sample_description = Recurrent melanoma isolated from patient B, 1st recurrence!Sample_data_processing = Agilent aCGH data obtained from microarray analysis were imported into the Partek Genomics Suite software (Partek), quantile normalized, converted into copy number values and pre-processed using its built-in segmentation algorithm. Individual chromosomal segments were defined as continuous regions covered by at least 10 consecutive microarray probes, a significant (p<0.001) and considerable (>0.3 copies on average) difference between the copy number (CN) of the given segment and neighboring segments, accepting an error rate of  less than +/- 0.3 copies!Sample_platform_id = GPL9075!Sample_contact_name = Zoltan,,Pos!Sample_contact_email = pos_zoltan@yahoo.com!Sample_contact_phone = +(36)12102930-56435!Sample_contact_department = Dept. of Genetics, Cell- and Immunobiology!Sample_contact_institute = Semmelweis University!Sample_contact_address = 4 Nagyvarad ter!Sample_contact_city = Budapest!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = H-1089!Sample_contact_country = Hungary!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM935nnn/GSM935691/suppl/GSM935691_US45103062_251469820725_140_IV_6p_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07_1_1.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38137!Sample_series_id = GSE38187!Sample_data_row_count = 99026#ID_REF = #VALUE = DNA copy numbers of Ch2 sample (metastatic melanoma) based on log2 ratio data for both channels!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P17404356	1.47136A_16_P17833431	3.79455A_14_P106953	1.91246A_16_P15853500	1.77671A_16_P38942937	1.08235A_14_P112424	4.63749A_14_P116868	0.953777A_14_P138704	3.59149A_16_P21423927	1.45918A_16_P35227232	1.58558A_16_P36411830	2.21225A_16_P16287796	2.01672A_14_P102903	1.91385A_14_P139398	1.01919A_16_P36316917	1.24215A_16_P18016009	2.41528A_16_P02763505	2.97402A_16_P20905138	1.14875A_14_P111822	1.16451A_14_P101811	4.73966!sample_table_end
