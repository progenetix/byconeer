Labeling reactions were performed using a Genomic DNA Enzymatic Labeling Kit (Agilent), according to the manufacturerâs recommendations. DNA was digested by AluI and RsaI in the presence of BSA for 2 hours at +37Â°C. After efficient fragmentation was confirmed by E-GelÂ® Agarose Gel Electrophoresis (Invitrogen), fragments were heat-denatured, random primers (Agilent) were annealed to them, and extended with help of the Exo-Klenow fragment in the presence of dNTP, Cyanine 5-dUTP and Cyanine 3-dUTP for samples and reference, respectively (all reagents from Agilent). Amplicons were purified on Amicon 30kDa filters (Agilent) and labeling efficiency was checked by assessing specific activity of Cy5 (A650) or Cy3 (A550) relative to the amount of DNA (A260) using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Nanodrop).!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Melanoma cells in culture!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = sample type: Recurrent!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = patient id: F!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = lesion id: F/3!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = date of isolation: 3/6/2003!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = origin: Surgery Branch, NIH, Bethesda, USA!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = originator's sample label: kilpatric 2139 frag P8!Sample_growth_protocol_ch2 = After surgical removal, stable cell cultures were established and maintained in IMDM (Gibco) supplemented by 10% Human Serum AB (Gemini)!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Total genomic DNA was isolated from 2x106 cells per sample by automated sample processing using the QuickGene DNA whole blood kit S and a QuickGene-810 Nucleic Acid Isolation System (Fujifilm), following the manufacturerâs instructions.

Human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen), Blocking Agent (Agilent), and Agilent1s 2X Hi-RPM Buffer were added to all samples, and hybridized to 105K Human Genome CGH 105A Oligo Microarrays (Agilent). Hybridization was done for 40 hours at +65Â°C, 20 rpm in a Microarray Hybridization Oven (Agilent). Arrays were washed with Oligo aCGH Wash Buffers (Agilent).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned in a High-Resolution Microarray Scanner (Agilent). Raw data retrieval was performed using Agilentâs Feature Extraction software.!Sample_description = Recurrent melanoma isolated from patient F, 3rd recurrence!Sample_data_processing = Agilent aCGH data obtained from microarray analysis were imported into the Partek Genomics Suite software (Partek), quantile normalized, converted into copy number values and pre-processed using its built-in segmentation algorithm. Individual chromosomal segments were defined as continuous regions covered by at least 10 consecutive microarray probes, a significant (p<0.001) and considerable (>0.3 copies on average) difference between the copy number (CN) of the given segment and neighboring segments, accepting an error rate of  less than +/- 0.3 copies!Sample_platform_id = GPL9075!Sample_contact_name = Zoltan,,Pos!Sample_contact_email = pos_zoltan@yahoo.com!Sample_contact_phone = +(36)12102930-56435!Sample_contact_department = Dept. of Genetics, Cell- and Immunobiology!Sample_contact_institute = Semmelweis University!Sample_contact_address = 4 Nagyvarad ter!Sample_contact_city = Budapest!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = H-1089!Sample_contact_country = Hungary!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM935nnn/GSM935703/suppl/GSM935703_US45103062_251469820701_kilpatric_2139_frag_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07_1_2.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38137!Sample_series_id = GSE38187!Sample_data_row_count = 99026#ID_REF = #VALUE = DNA copy numbers of Ch2 sample (metastatic melanoma) based on log2 ratio data for both channels!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P17404356	4.31097A_16_P17833431	2.96338A_14_P106953	1.75587A_16_P15853500	2.17055A_16_P38942937	1.41807A_14_P112424	4.04533A_14_P116868	1.83139A_14_P138704	3.06201A_16_P21423927	1.33885A_16_P35227232	1.42079A_16_P36411830	2.24931A_16_P16287796	3.10668A_14_P102903	1.21564A_14_P139398	1.25878A_16_P36316917	2.16513A_16_P18016009	3.45956A_16_P02763505	2.15832A_16_P20905138	0.848137A_14_P111822	1.82615A_14_P101811	3.51234!sample_table_end
