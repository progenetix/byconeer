The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313702/suppl/GSM313702.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3#CH2_SIG = Cy5#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	3.570000	557.6620000	21.3110000	0.0100002	-4.160000	110.3460000	3346.6290000	0.1900003	0.140000	23822.3610000	30060.5630000	0.8200004	0.140000	15411.4870000	20827.6070000	0.8200005	0.380000	17380.0230000	19698.4790000	0.8400006	0.100000	18288.3360000	24462.6620000	0.8100007	0.050000	20669.0590000	28051.6800000	0.7800008	-0.010000	150.3450000	63.4210000	0.0100009	-0.200000	4184.3390000	9873.8200000	0.77000010	0.220000	43905.9020000	48599.0120000	0.64000011	-0.110000	40580.8320000	56103.5120000	0.48000012	0.090000	23597.7680000	30877.4340000	0.80000013	0.380000	15010.2530000	17633.6860000	0.86000014	0.290000	6305.5070000	9827.1460000	0.85000015	-0.430000	2021.5050000	7366.2940000	0.60000016	-0.030000	7709.1930000	13724.8490000	0.85000017	-0.200000	8900.2490000	16835.6820000	0.90000018	0.230000	13144.2600000	17560.4570000	0.83000019	0.270000	15291.9420000	19149.7850000	0.80000020	0.430000	21567.5390000	22795.5060000	0.700000!sample_table_end
