The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313703/suppl/GSM313703.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3#CH2_SIG = Cy5#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	-0.800000	131.8990000	172.5630000	0.0100002	-0.500000	1226.0880000	5038.7910000	0.3900003	-0.030000	29372.3950000	41581.1370000	0.6800004	-0.050000	17503.6020000	27013.8910000	0.7900005	0.070000	20214.7010000	28169.6390000	0.8700006	0.010000	24560.0120000	34809.3550000	0.7500007	0.030000	28291.2480000	38738.8590000	0.7100008	1.750000	321.1140000	72.4900000	0.0100009	-0.010000	7050.2030000	12431.6020000	0.84000010	0.250000	58235.0430000	57485.9880000	0.25000011	-0.100000	46520.0230000	60286.0940000	0.31000012	0.030000	30387.1330000	41071.4100000	0.69000013	0.140000	19900.6050000	26715.0080000	0.87000014	0.040000	9476.9860000	15293.9650000	0.91000015	-0.110000	4349.5650000	9284.5470000	0.77000016	-0.120000	10803.1510000	18866.5330000	0.81000017	-0.140000	13748.6400000	23265.6270000	0.85000018	0.070000	17043.8730000	24447.4840000	0.76000019	0.060000	17125.4980000	24742.1210000	0.72000020	0.190000	25486.2320000	31798.8910000	0.840000!sample_table_end
