The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313687/suppl/GSM313687.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3#CH2_SIG = Cy5#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	1.870000	103.9960000	45.4780000	0.0100002	-3.750000	84.2150000	2531.4060000	0.1900003	0.040000	25112.0120000	27901.3540000	0.8000004	0.220000	20184.1950000	20816.7400000	0.8200005	0.100000	35902.5350000	37180.1020000	0.7300006	0.200000	32456.1190000	31481.5000000	0.6900007	-0.020000	25172.6860000	28962.8610000	0.7700008	-1.740000	93.2040000	625.3090000	0.0100009	-0.180000	6044.8800000	11277.2920000	0.83000010	-0.270000	60548.8630000	76042.9770000	0.35000011	-0.500000	34225.9100000	52712.6840000	0.67000012	0.160000	52071.9800000	49884.4300000	0.70000013	0.390000	24162.8980000	21639.9340000	0.74000014	0.130000	7637.6610000	10988.6680000	0.82000015	-0.370000	3689.0490000	9209.6100000	0.72000016	-0.110000	14666.2560000	20043.5550000	0.77000017	-0.110000	21177.9360000	26633.9670000	0.81000018	0.030000	20484.5270000	23635.0820000	0.69000019	0.020000	26093.0640000	29176.9630000	0.75000020	0.340000	38647.4840000	33903.2110000	0.770000!sample_table_end
