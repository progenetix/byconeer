The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313652/suppl/GSM313652.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3 Test#CH2_SIG = Cy5 Ref#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	3.510000	1199.2460000	130.4710000	0.0100002	2.710000	855.0930000	144.5630000	0.0100003	0.140000	14651.6520000	15982.3500000	0.7300004	0.050000	11032.4310000	13775.0150000	0.6700005	-0.430000	11216.1880000	18643.6890000	0.8600006	-0.390000	12313.1290000	19447.2970000	0.8600007	0.120000	18455.2190000	19327.3130000	0.8400008	-1.470000	114.5880000	136.0570000	0.0100009	0.030000	3501.2160000	6944.9930000	0.49000010	0.040000	46276.3830000	45593.8830000	0.65000011	-0.070000	51184.8550000	54126.6640000	0.55000012	-0.320000	19924.0740000	27064.6210000	0.85000013	-0.240000	9423.6670000	14537.2250000	0.85000014	-0.600000	1092.6630000	5400.2030000	0.22000015	-0.480000	3985.8220000	9758.5760000	0.60000016	-0.250000	6982.2290000	11977.7490000	0.78000017	0.100000	14298.3300000	16219.5600000	0.88000018	0.130000	11637.4460000	13622.3410000	0.87000019	-0.340000	9646.7990000	15756.0050000	0.85000020	0.040000	16832.2320000	18864.0530000	0.900000!sample_table_end
