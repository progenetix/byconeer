The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313683/suppl/GSM313683.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 31610#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3#CH2_SIG = Cy5#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	2.821918	396.2520000	101.1980000	0.0100002	-5.289493	22.1840000	1539.6560000	0.1700003	-0.104350	12926.0910000	16281.8810000	0.8300004	0.264857	10795.8430000	11506.3260000	0.7800005	0.146452	16445.0140000	16698.2170000	0.8600006	0.640033	24601.1860000	16881.0350000	0.6900007	-0.130897	12679.7110000	16352.1530000	0.8000008	1.899268	327.3250000	165.1730000	0.0100009	0.375450	4942.9820000	6533.7020000	0.79000010	0.153476	49881.2770000	44684.2070000	0.49000011	-0.632934	23366.1800000	36699.1170000	0.59000012	0.510770	39677.3280000	28147.4610000	0.62000013	0.634063	15576.2320000	11991.8140000	0.84000014	0.102407	3372.1650000	6112.2530000	0.66000015	-0.987186	1249.0340000	6299.9990000	0.37000016	-0.075963	8214.9750000	11656.3450000	0.86000017	0.511322	18901.1390000	14882.6880000	0.83000018	0.500535	16562.5020000	13565.8020000	0.78000019	0.211930	17491.1390000	16872.3030000	0.73000020	0.484077	23815.2830000	18095.8570000	0.690000!sample_table_end
