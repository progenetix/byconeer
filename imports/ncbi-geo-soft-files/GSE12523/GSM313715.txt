The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313715/suppl/GSM313715.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3#CH2_SIG = Cy5#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	2.430000	628.0920000	63.5460000	0.0100002	0.510000	2328.2530000	3466.4340000	0.5700003	0.260000	13638.5620000	15307.2680000	0.8300004	0.160000	8207.3610000	10696.9050000	0.8600005	0.540000	11274.7440000	10860.1120000	0.8300006	0.370000	12044.0270000	12816.6140000	0.8100007	0.130000	11576.0870000	14456.4960000	0.7300008	0.610000	585.8230000	328.2460000	0.0400009	-0.020000	7741.5020000	11394.9330000	0.83000010	0.200000	22684.2790000	25002.2290000	0.49000011	-0.150000	28422.8830000	38390.7190000	0.61000012	-0.090000	11356.3840000	16404.0210000	0.70000013	-0.420000	4489.8020000	9502.9260000	0.80000014	-0.620000	1741.7900000	5527.6990000	0.49000015	-0.280000	2341.6700000	5510.0640000	0.65000016	0.010000	5779.4500000	8835.2290000	0.81000017	0.020000	7131.4280000	10328.9480000	0.83000018	0.050000	6404.5250000	9374.2850000	0.78000019	0.050000	7828.1840000	10981.2140000	0.78000020	0.060000	9033.4010000	12201.5940000	0.730000!sample_table_end
