The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313708/suppl/GSM313708.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 30946#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3#CH2_SIG = Cy5#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	2.100000	542.9600000	147.9350000	0.0100002	-0.270000	834.6840000	5154.9190000	0.1900003	0.030000	40977.7460000	41537.3160000	0.9200004	-0.170000	16670.2440000	24089.9120000	0.9200005	-1.060000	13332.8380000	34855.6840000	0.8700006	-0.610000	25064.6110000	42165.2500000	0.8000007	-0.580000	22174.1210000	37802.4100000	0.8900008	1.120000	384.4880000	188.9410000	0.0100009	-0.730000	6710.7440000	17382.6560000	0.74000010	-0.380000	49043.5660000	61464.7810000	0.33000011	-0.230000	51499.9410000	58360.8240000	0.45000012	-0.660000	29489.4120000	49312.0000000	0.88000013	0.020000	22517.4120000	26725.5780000	0.90000014	-0.630000	6711.1890000	16296.5730000	0.74000015	-0.770000	1857.2120000	8715.0160000	0.39000016	-0.100000	15261.2400000	21549.2420000	0.92000017	-0.870000	10910.8450000	26905.6310000	0.90000018	-0.100000	19446.4510000	25822.6600000	0.80000019	-0.540000	18912.7090000	32910.9380000	0.90000020	-0.200000	32023.6560000	39716.4610000	0.750000!sample_table_end
