The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313695/suppl/GSM313695.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 31609#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3#CH2_SIG = Cy5#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	1.960000	1539.9700000	201.0710000	0.0500002	-0.250000	955.9610000	2085.0890000	0.1900003	0.460000	29688.8870000	20365.8570000	0.7700004	-0.140000	8786.3640000	11610.1040000	0.7500005	-0.720000	8744.7430000	16400.9770000	0.8000006	0.020000	17129.5430000	17533.1580000	0.8100007	0.090000	17394.5680000	16893.2560000	0.7600008	0.680000	735.8970000	62.5100000	0.0100009	0.650000	8713.1460000	7069.2270000	0.81000010	0.220000	43204.3010000	33856.0230000	0.56000011	0.150000	30676.2130000	25380.3590000	0.58000012	-0.320000	18997.3090000	23259.5390000	0.63000013	0.730000	16204.0420000	10850.6840000	0.77000014	0.130000	4368.0700000	5840.4110000	0.64000015	0.480000	4269.3350000	4690.5580000	0.66000016	0.020000	8001.5290000	9792.5500000	0.84000017	0.800000	20091.9840000	12259.2190000	0.79000018	0.180000	11460.4060000	11696.6550000	0.81000019	0.100000	13463.2870000	13838.4000000	0.68000020	0.820000	27039.5000000	15187.4610000	0.650000!sample_table_end
