The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313709/suppl/GSM313709.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 30946#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3#CH2_SIG = Cy5#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	1.860000	601.4780000	30.5490000	0.0100002	-3.580000	298.0440000	4611.0400000	0.1900003	0.390000	47488.0660000	35541.4960000	0.8200004	-0.240000	14341.7050000	19664.1860000	0.8600005	-0.860000	13902.7370000	28116.1020000	0.8200006	-0.880000	17942.4100000	34401.4960000	0.8500007	-0.260000	27348.4900000	32853.1880000	0.8500008	1.970000	763.3680000	50.8110000	0.0100009	-0.120000	11628.0110000	15749.0400000	0.84000010	-0.010000	56885.3090000	56728.0660000	0.28000011	-0.440000	39827.0310000	53709.2850000	0.52000012	0.140000	43165.2540000	38619.0120000	0.78000013	0.010000	20873.5940000	22424.9610000	0.87000014	0.030000	9934.2820000	12905.1070000	0.82000015	-1.020000	1688.3080000	7597.8990000	0.36000016	-0.380000	11451.6300000	18172.4450000	0.84000017	-1.100000	9673.5980000	24689.1070000	0.84000018	-0.260000	15648.3280000	21320.3130000	0.84000019	-0.020000	25590.7250000	26795.6190000	0.80000020	0.030000	35044.8590000	33851.8710000	0.760000!sample_table_end
