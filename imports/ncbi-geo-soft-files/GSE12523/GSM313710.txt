The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313710/suppl/GSM313710.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3#CH2_SIG = Cy5#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	2.290000	642.5330000	45.7950000	0.0100002	-1.130000	818.2080000	4155.8810000	0.2200003	-0.440000	24270.4060000	29402.5530000	0.6800004	-0.030000	12320.1990000	13721.5080000	0.8700005	-0.080000	22058.5330000	21668.1370000	0.7900006	0.730000	48893.9260000	25366.2070000	0.6400007	0.120000	31453.7380000	25433.6860000	0.6300008	1.180000	386.2650000	50.2180000	0.0100009	-0.130000	10039.1240000	12538.2750000	0.85000010	0.000000	56465.0390000	47886.6290000	0.26000011	-0.610000	36730.4840000	48124.7460000	0.70000012	-0.100000	30402.5640000	28492.0820000	0.62000013	1.040000	45022.9450000	19140.3090000	0.68000014	0.120000	9568.5100000	10376.9180000	0.72000015	-0.030000	3248.4380000	5407.1570000	0.64000016	-0.210000	9880.5950000	12997.6790000	0.81000017	-0.370000	12778.1150000	17296.1970000	0.80000018	0.340000	21868.4880000	16773.1820000	0.72000019	-0.080000	17533.9750000	18373.7600000	0.64000020	-0.100000	25904.1800000	25035.0000000	0.700000!sample_table_end
