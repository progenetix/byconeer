The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313659/suppl/GSM313659.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3 Test#CH2_SIG = Cy5 Ref#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	3.430000	765.9270000	203.3010000	0.0100002	5.130000	1441.7620000	126.2000000	0.0400003	0.710000	10915.0240000	9875.1510000	0.6900004	0.320000	6717.9770000	9327.5750000	0.6400005	0.760000	11432.4910000	9846.1060000	0.8000006	0.490000	11641.0320000	11578.8380000	0.7900007	1.030000	19181.4880000	11656.5090000	0.8100008	4.410000	860.3180000	78.4260000	0.0100009	1.540000	8843.1450000	5661.6740000	0.66000010	-0.100000	24419.9000000	26311.7380000	0.83000011	0.330000	39433.9650000	30039.4000000	0.72000012	-0.010000	13710.8670000	16910.3890000	0.91000013	0.900000	8976.6770000	7996.8550000	0.73000014	0.140000	842.7220000	4045.3520000	0.19000015	0.410000	2025.7100000	5295.3860000	0.34000016	0.460000	4961.0780000	7524.2960000	0.63000017	-0.380000	5232.3320000	11829.1310000	0.65000018	1.320000	18060.4200000	9492.4370000	0.84000019	0.180000	7280.6470000	10511.6290000	0.73000020	0.190000	10262.9600000	12714.0690000	0.840000!sample_table_end
