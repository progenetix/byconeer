The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313694/suppl/GSM313694.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3#CH2_SIG = Cy5#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	1.580000	455.5060000	39.6140000	0.0100002	-0.480000	1757.2680000	3859.2810000	0.4300003	0.050000	26605.8550000	24970.4220000	0.6900004	-0.180000	13365.8270000	16078.5220000	0.7000005	-0.080000	23823.5920000	24709.4980000	0.7200006	0.140000	24950.8380000	22364.4390000	0.7100007	-0.310000	17859.0780000	22505.3110000	0.7500008	-0.760000	308.8100000	210.0840000	0.0100009	-0.010000	9847.5120000	11164.8640000	0.86000010	0.320000	60768.8980000	45629.1950000	0.25000011	-0.380000	36819.9490000	44271.2930000	0.59000012	0.130000	34190.2730000	29378.2150000	0.65000013	-0.120000	14179.5810000	16293.2760000	0.81000014	0.130000	6813.0530000	7573.4800000	0.84000015	-0.090000	5778.3800000	7639.7960000	0.73000016	-0.010000	11292.4240000	12492.7230000	0.77000017	-0.270000	13439.9310000	17182.8570000	0.81000018	0.530000	19768.3830000	14320.0800000	0.71000019	-0.260000	13661.3570000	17339.0290000	0.64000020	0.190000	27144.8130000	23143.5450000	0.610000!sample_table_end
