The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313692/suppl/GSM313692.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3#CH2_SIG = Cy5#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	0.500000	84530.8360000	55925.4380000	0.3100002	0.340000	83761.9920000	62046.9020000	0.2700003	0.260000	81838.0860000	64008.4650000	0.3400004	0.320000	83567.3830000	62709.9800000	0.2700005	0.120000	47186.7500000	39368.3670000	0.7500006	0.010000	34015.4100000	30001.9340000	0.7000007	0.140000	24112.3180000	19309.3670000	0.7000008	0.990000	5796.0120000	3563.1810000	0.5300009	0.380000	22539.4120000	15334.6170000	0.79000010	0.020000	47197.4180000	42331.9490000	0.59000011	0.170000	53016.2770000	43008.0160000	0.49000012	0.040000	32520.0940000	28103.8400000	0.71000013	-0.120000	34728.0940000	33617.8240000	0.73000014	0.270000	27591.7710000	20113.2170000	0.78000015	-0.050000	21436.4020000	19504.3890000	0.77000016	0.200000	19959.5530000	15453.3870000	0.73000017	0.490000	26907.0490000	16936.3460000	0.80000018	0.280000	21982.2700000	16088.5070000	0.80000019	0.150000	24706.3890000	19565.5610000	0.65000020	0.130000	32471.4650000	26119.1390000	0.580000!sample_table_end
