The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313678/suppl/GSM313678.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3#CH2_SIG = Cy5#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	3.940675	955.2040000	148.9100000	0.0100002	-6.875205	6.9200000	1368.3070000	0.0300003	0.091654	9284.6140000	12985.8700000	0.8900004	0.299914	8325.4950000	10633.4210000	0.8700005	0.171389	9779.6310000	12848.0250000	0.8900006	0.367972	13047.8160000	14129.7880000	0.8100007	0.031230	9093.8190000	13280.8910000	0.8700008	1.785547	277.2620000	168.5420000	0.0100009	-0.853372	944.1510000	5146.7030000	0.29000010	0.254072	33041.9220000	33719.7770000	0.69000011	-0.686390	13510.4660000	28075.5040000	0.77000012	0.199889	20399.2090000	22661.0390000	0.70000013	0.512557	8144.2600000	9260.5940000	0.91000014	0.033131	2112.8110000	5251.0630000	0.52000015	-2.896358	192.7060000	4301.1530000	0.20000016	-0.170576	4748.5650000	9615.2290000	0.81000017	0.184987	8856.9990000	11913.2840000	0.85000018	0.176892	7830.6000000	11008.6120000	0.84000019	-0.383904	7076.8300000	14272.2580000	0.86000020	0.369231	13004.1920000	14084.3610000	0.810000!sample_table_end
