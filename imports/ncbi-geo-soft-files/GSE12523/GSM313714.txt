The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313714/suppl/GSM313714.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 30946#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3#CH2_SIG = Cy5#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	1.630000	633.6960000	59.5250000	0.0100002	0.290000	3352.2990000	3648.2410000	0.5000003	0.080000	37364.5550000	28149.2950000	0.6900004	-0.070000	15811.8160000	14470.8610000	0.7400005	-0.590000	17627.9790000	21956.3160000	0.7200006	-0.420000	22395.9610000	24359.7270000	0.6600007	-0.120000	25614.2500000	22400.4200000	0.6800008	0.050000	536.0660000	234.3780000	0.0100009	0.650000	20109.8090000	11147.1480000	0.86000010	-0.280000	41453.7810000	41372.0980000	0.57000011	-0.010000	46647.4410000	38576.0160000	0.52000012	-0.400000	26083.6660000	27674.2890000	0.73000013	0.540000	27469.0430000	15568.6490000	0.75000014	0.510000	10684.0660000	7244.1060000	0.78000015	-0.200000	3278.1350000	4728.4950000	0.60000016	-0.150000	11373.8420000	11590.3840000	0.79000017	0.130000	18250.2230000	14352.0470000	0.79000018	0.120000	13800.4850000	11470.7600000	0.77000019	-0.480000	12677.8820000	15594.8500000	0.78000020	0.110000	24811.0230000	18823.5800000	0.720000!sample_table_end
