The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313716/suppl/GSM313716.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3#CH2_SIG = Cy5#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	0.580000	369.3120000	60.6970000	0.0100002	0.630000	5165.8630000	5301.6690000	0.6700003	-0.330000	36186.4140000	45068.9490000	0.9000004	-0.050000	20925.9790000	23901.5180000	0.8800005	-0.300000	30966.7090000	38644.0200000	0.7500006	-0.420000	30690.9530000	41326.7300000	0.8000007	-0.090000	34258.9770000	36851.8870000	0.7200008	1.460000	499.0650000	44.3510000	0.0100009	0.290000	12996.4140000	12911.1220000	0.89000010	-0.080000	63947.2110000	64586.7770000	0.34000011	-0.390000	42997.0900000	55227.9570000	0.73000012	-0.430000	36455.8550000	48637.0470000	0.79000013	0.370000	27612.0250000	23027.4710000	0.88000014	0.500000	15044.0940000	12704.5400000	0.93000015	-0.190000	5244.3500000	8591.8150000	0.75000016	-0.220000	14883.6780000	19905.5610000	0.85000017	-0.860000	10982.8510000	23235.6450000	0.92000018	0.410000	28534.4240000	22983.2870000	0.81000019	-0.520000	22193.7380000	33852.8750000	0.78000020	0.620000	48071.5230000	31280.1840000	0.730000!sample_table_end
