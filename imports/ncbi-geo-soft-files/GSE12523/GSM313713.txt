The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313713/suppl/GSM313713.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3#CH2_SIG = Cy5#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	3.050000	1581.6240000	85.8910000	0.0100002	0.760000	6392.9140000	4493.6890000	0.6300003	0.630000	56799.7300000	30649.2890000	0.2500004	-0.020000	19360.0840000	17113.9570000	0.8500005	-0.140000	23960.7380000	22320.1540000	0.7400006	0.580000	45963.3710000	25073.5700000	0.5700007	0.020000	33973.2890000	27387.3830000	0.6100008	3.740000	5009.3460000	547.0330000	0.0100009	0.240000	17544.6000000	13431.6340000	0.85000010	-0.020000	53776.4410000	47325.4100000	0.32000011	0.040000	50480.8320000	41951.4300000	0.50000012	-0.440000	28907.0550000	32012.5410000	0.70000013	0.290000	28910.8930000	19861.5000000	0.73000014	0.000000	9993.0040000	9715.9720000	0.81000015	0.300000	5513.5830000	5290.8160000	0.70000016	-0.080000	14612.8510000	14041.9140000	0.77000017	0.040000	21760.6820000	18205.8180000	0.80000018	0.500000	25423.1520000	15434.3190000	0.72000019	-0.520000	15954.8570000	20083.8980000	0.69000020	0.170000	33243.0230000	24177.6020000	0.670000!sample_table_end
