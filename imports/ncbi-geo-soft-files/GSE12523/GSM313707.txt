The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313707/suppl/GSM313707.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3#CH2_SIG = Cy5#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	1.770000	807.7610000	43.4870000	0.0100002	-0.140000	2267.2660000	4176.5480000	0.3900003	-0.670000	20506.2270000	30568.9530000	0.9000004	-0.170000	16372.1990000	19082.8360000	0.8900005	-0.700000	15643.4110000	25587.9080000	0.8800006	-0.920000	16271.9370000	30157.5060000	0.9000007	-0.090000	30069.6720000	28579.0350000	0.9000008	-3.880000	104.4420000	247.8130000	0.0100009	0.300000	10468.6400000	9928.7090000	0.70000010	-0.150000	54733.2770000	57283.6560000	0.32000011	-0.500000	43147.9380000	55576.0080000	0.65000012	-1.040000	21760.2870000	40073.6170000	0.90000013	0.190000	21940.3540000	19149.7380000	0.91000014	-1.370000	3553.2730000	12061.4090000	0.57000015	-0.820000	2828.1200000	7533.1150000	0.54000016	-0.350000	12671.4620000	17455.1460000	0.88000017	-0.170000	17129.7950000	19846.0490000	0.91000018	0.560000	29437.2010000	19114.5610000	0.79000019	-1.080000	11259.1380000	25036.3220000	0.90000020	0.500000	48397.9490000	29479.4340000	0.820000!sample_table_end
