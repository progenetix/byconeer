The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313674/suppl/GSM313674.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3#CH2_SIG = Cy5#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	4.079608	587.4430000	150.9410000	0.0100002	-3.134527	57.3470000	2315.3090000	0.1700003	0.293389	26205.8910000	24013.1520000	0.7800004	-0.178167	15343.6610000	21178.6150000	0.7700005	-0.271527	15893.5370000	23000.5960000	0.8000006	-0.009840	22284.4940000	25439.7710000	0.7300007	-0.363294	15011.4270000	23358.2750000	0.8000008	4.128336	531.0770000	126.2070000	0.0100009	0.334144	7075.6660000	9090.0800000	0.76000010	-0.046539	54256.3480000	54348.2930000	0.40000011	-0.202373	44605.0860000	51057.5470000	0.36000012	-0.252153	31441.2030000	39459.2660000	0.73000013	0.708159	22304.7150000	16415.5020000	0.84000014	0.200547	5851.1280000	8719.4820000	0.81000015	-0.112002	20218.7070000	25194.6970000	0.51000016	0.010266	12282.3650000	15994.7520000	0.83000017	0.378948	23177.9240000	20643.9450000	0.77000018	0.380734	21009.7600000	19096.3380000	0.75000019	-0.480092	13530.7700000	23095.0100000	0.92000020	0.252907	26780.6890000	25132.5820000	0.760000!sample_table_end
