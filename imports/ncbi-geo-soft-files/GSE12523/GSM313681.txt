The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313681/suppl/GSM313681.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3#CH2_SIG = Cy5#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	2.459196	303.4470000	120.4910000	0.0100002	2.477977	1105.0390000	987.5030000	0.1700003	1.058783	7167.3530000	6183.9580000	0.8200004	0.446643	3036.0980000	5413.9230000	0.6200005	-2.465103	195.1470000	5370.2560000	0.2000006	-0.226295	1721.0040000	5876.8890000	0.4200007	0.318180	3512.1220000	6206.1080000	0.6600008	1.485354	240.6340000	203.7930000	0.0600009	-4.411529	39.4230000	2354.0490000	0.20000010	0.392736	16494.1230000	15818.3420000	0.57000011	-0.375079	6985.5270000	13747.0010000	0.77000012	0.776107	13933.7580000	11267.8540000	0.73000013	0.727222	2138.2500000	4009.6760000	0.52000014	-3.442540	64.7910000	2206.5180000	0.20000015	-5.196592	24.1390000	2127.7410000	0.20000016	-0.098401	1034.6690000	4367.7070000	0.30000017	-0.870511	826.3790000	5843.5830000	0.26000018	-0.098746	1483.1740000	5159.8560000	0.37000019	0.621773	4639.6080000	6128.2850000	0.78000020	1.049063	6881.4610000	6088.4360000	0.810000!sample_table_end
