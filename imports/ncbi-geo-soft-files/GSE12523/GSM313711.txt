The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313711/suppl/GSM313711.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3#CH2_SIG = Cy5#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	2.690000	602.1250000	16.9130000	0.0100002	-1.980000	521.1170000	3568.7100000	0.1900003	0.190000	31939.2750000	20750.9060000	0.7800004	-0.120000	10076.2730000	10703.2400000	0.7800005	-0.530000	13078.7820000	16278.6930000	0.8500006	0.480000	37407.0860000	19864.9380000	0.7100007	0.140000	29795.7460000	20283.4360000	0.6300008	0.880000	485.0050000	85.2330000	0.0100009	0.120000	12090.5140000	10509.7900000	0.89000010	0.160000	56784.3400000	38907.0470000	0.23000011	-0.760000	32808.4960000	41285.3980000	0.63000012	-0.630000	20080.5250000	23573.3140000	0.71000013	-0.120000	20032.0000000	17183.7910000	0.75000014	0.480000	13369.1010000	9144.5920000	0.84000015	-0.370000	2651.5170000	4828.3400000	0.61000016	0.190000	13167.1950000	10716.2070000	0.79000017	-0.120000	14790.3700000	13944.5750000	0.85000018	0.380000	23644.1270000	14347.0940000	0.73000019	0.270000	24640.9550000	15825.8750000	0.66000020	0.350000	36260.5820000	21063.2830000	0.510000!sample_table_end
