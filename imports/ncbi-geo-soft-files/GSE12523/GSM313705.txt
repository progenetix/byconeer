The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313705/suppl/GSM313705.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3#CH2_SIG = Cy5#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	2.266507	521.5990000	49.7800000	0.0100002	-0.931780	1168.1830000	5133.6310000	0.4200003	0.215654	32449.9840000	35233.4450000	0.7900004	0.317757	22179.2230000	23798.9880000	0.7800005	-0.598542	10480.3470000	22988.0330000	0.9200006	-0.081599	23027.9530000	31671.2850000	0.9100007	-0.184368	20491.2070000	30544.7890000	0.9000008	0.830653	388.6000000	120.5730000	0.0100009	-0.575438	3574.3040000	9307.0910000	0.74000010	0.030106	49611.8550000	55204.1130000	0.69000011	-0.467065	34578.4020000	56381.7340000	0.63000012	0.140719	30740.8320000	35358.1290000	0.75000013	0.792185	32303.0800000	24050.6540000	0.88000014	-0.346406	7768.9420000	15138.6100000	0.90000015	-0.333098	2922.5330000	6980.0830000	0.70000016	-0.412313	8984.8320000	17791.5470000	0.90000017	0.055494	15725.7720000	21184.1480000	0.85000018	0.800747	28120.3810000	21331.5940000	0.82000019	-0.207614	14547.0240000	23377.2270000	0.85000020	-0.141324	21453.7770000	30910.6520000	0.770000!sample_table_end
