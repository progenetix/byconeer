The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313690/suppl/GSM313690.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3#CH2_SIG = Cy5#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	0.280223	136.5810000	162.9650000	0.0100002	-4.306157	74.2390000	2503.5580000	0.1800003	-0.255015	16681.0230000	19540.8180000	0.9000004	0.292166	14768.2180000	12091.9060000	0.8900005	-0.367941	20442.2320000	25608.5630000	0.8500006	-0.099171	20652.5700000	21519.9470000	0.8700007	0.143464	19491.5080000	17417.6250000	0.8800008	-2.250496	81.5700000	596.9470000	0.0400009	-0.174852	7768.7880000	9416.9640000	0.86000010	0.322299	52000.6290000	39920.1560000	0.70000011	-0.421608	32592.5040000	41862.2660000	0.78000012	-0.129625	22569.6350000	23974.4530000	0.78000013	-0.699925	13216.8030000	21287.3670000	0.91000014	-0.082790	6401.9990000	7683.8680000	0.86000015	-0.802948	4073.0440000	8548.8500000	0.80000016	0.328878	13011.6540000	10513.3010000	0.87000017	0.233881	14227.2080000	12187.3010000	0.86000018	-0.079774	10516.7570000	11352.8540000	0.78000019	-0.045521	12885.0500000	13322.3900000	0.86000020	-0.494658	15256.1720000	21144.7640000	0.750000!sample_table_end
