The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313712/suppl/GSM313712.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3#CH2_SIG = Cy5#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	0.070000	603.1970000	265.1330000	0.0100002	0.490000	4746.4300000	4481.9190000	0.6700003	0.280000	37900.3160000	29630.1950000	0.9000004	-0.040000	17180.8710000	17258.9840000	0.9000005	0.300000	21925.5410000	17030.2360000	0.9300006	-0.570000	18864.5100000	26568.1930000	0.9300007	-0.060000	27856.5700000	27279.3360000	0.8800008	-2.710000	209.2570000	559.7540000	0.0100009	0.110000	13581.3340000	12911.3200000	0.91000010	0.260000	58936.3750000	48505.0980000	0.32000011	0.000000	47714.9960000	46472.6990000	0.75000012	-0.100000	29193.9430000	29685.3590000	0.93000013	1.000000	40414.6210000	18952.4530000	0.86000014	-0.220000	8086.2160000	10357.7800000	0.75000015	-0.220000	4693.4040000	6771.7450000	0.76000016	-0.260000	11280.9720000	14044.6600000	0.91000017	0.030000	17940.6020000	17235.5550000	0.91000018	0.040000	17197.7010000	16440.0160000	0.91000019	-0.200000	17691.4320000	19582.7950000	0.90000020	0.040000	26258.4160000	23961.0100000	0.860000!sample_table_end
