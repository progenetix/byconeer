The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM313nnn/GSM313686/suppl/GSM313686.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12523!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3#CH2_SIG = Cy5#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	-0.244857	32.8240000	69.0320000	0.0100002	-3.326979	31.9840000	1119.9740000	0.1700003	0.595899	7100.4180000	9177.6180000	0.8400004	0.522903	6969.6460000	9426.6220000	0.7500005	-0.336645	2919.8340000	9305.3900000	0.6300006	0.233206	4693.6840000	8824.9400000	0.7400007	0.021151	4954.3640000	10220.3080000	0.7900008	0.135767	79.3150000	210.2260000	0.0400009	-0.768031	472.8650000	5211.1970000	0.20000010	-0.095752	16278.6630000	23770.8650000	0.76000011	-0.290317	13120.7110000	22853.8050000	0.76000012	0.068766	11446.4710000	16795.1130000	0.82000013	0.983975	5170.0200000	6218.6240000	0.79000014	-2.310922	112.9950000	3219.7760000	0.18000015	-3.371253	61.3470000	3181.0180000	0.20000016	-0.053817	2065.7380000	6912.9670000	0.53000017	-0.372057	3117.3330000	9796.4690000	0.67000018	0.205598	3766.6610000	7977.8170000	0.73000019	-0.047919	4271.7620000	9722.2580000	0.73000020	0.497534	9117.9750000	11306.0860000	0.800000!sample_table_end
