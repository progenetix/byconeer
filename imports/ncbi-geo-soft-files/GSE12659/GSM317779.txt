Amplified DNA was then digested with 50 units of Alu I and Rsa I at 37Â° for 2 hours and purified by using QIAQuick PCR clean-up kit. Labeling reactions were performed with 7 ug aliquots of this DNA at 37C for 3 hours using BioPrime Array CGH Genomic Labeling Module with 3 umol Cy5- or Cy3-dUTP, Invitrogen. Labeled samples were purified , concentrated on a Centricon YM-30 column, Millipore.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = human female blood pooled genomic DNA, Promega!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = human female pooled genomic DNA, Promega!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Genomic DNA extracted using Qiagen Dneasy mini kit following manufacturer's instructions!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = 10 ng of genomic DNA was amplified with phi29 DNA polymerase at 30Â°C for 16 hours.
