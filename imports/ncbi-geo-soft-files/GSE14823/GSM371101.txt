To identify regions of similar genomic status within the array-CGH data, we applied the segmentation software GLAD. Imbalances with log2 ratios of less than -1.0 were scored as putative homozygous deletions, because this threshold corresponds to an average copy number of less than 1, suggesting the presence of at least one subpopulation of cells with homozygous deletions. Gains with log2 ratios higher than 1.0 were scored as amplifications.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8175!Sample_contact_name = Aurelie,,Ernst!Sample_contact_institute = DKFZ!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM371nnn/GSM371101/suppl/GSM371101_309794.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14823!Sample_series_id = GSE14824!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (glioblastoma/reference DNA)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEG007563	0.101191915G007109	0.185492665G007107	0.288989362G007641	0.034628971G000001	G003128	G007091	0.418580628G003295	0.098821775G007108	-0.06517558G007087	0.04748675G007105	0.240992045G004205	0.269753619G008027	0.002926846G006935	-0.001025441G003545	0.099689183G004383	0.127982936G007635	G007004	0.030512099G004055	0.062191855G004626	0.164028342!sample_table_end
