To identify regions of similar genomic status within the array-CGH data, we applied the segmentation software GLAD. Imbalances with log2 ratios of less than -1.0 were scored as putative homozygous deletions, because this threshold corresponds to an average copy number of less than 1, suggesting the presence of at least one subpopulation of cells with homozygous deletions. Gains with log2 ratios higher than 1.0 were scored as amplifications.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8175!Sample_contact_name = Aurelie,,Ernst!Sample_contact_institute = DKFZ!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM371nnn/GSM371099/suppl/GSM371099_140180.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14823!Sample_series_id = GSE14824!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (glioblastoma/reference DNA)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEG007563	-0.069210241G007109	0.171915877G007107	0.147325107G007641	-0.054745161G000001	0.07205601G003128	-0.039560972G007091	0.174573964G003295	0.029836742G007108	0.004274596G007087	-0.016696132G007105	-0.093909462G004205	0.03642693G008027	-0.074973841G006935	-0.027905788G003545	0.098294064G004383	0.014813379G007635	-0.250914251G007004	-0.063704864G004055	-0.031896511G004626	-0.035930266!sample_table_end
