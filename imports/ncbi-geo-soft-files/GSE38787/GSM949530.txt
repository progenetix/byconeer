Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949530/suppl/GSM949530_15007_Primary_Ascites.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	13.3701709549153SNP_A-1967418	10.7508232981043SNP_A-1969580	14.4587843183651SNP_A-4263484	11.1704387176932SNP_A-1978185	11.4995767100749SNP_A-4264431	12.5882466096225SNP_A-1980898	11.3730589542789SNP_A-1983139	13.3468673981565SNP_A-4265735	12.0958805205076SNP_A-1995832	13.4765310244417SNP_A-1995893	13.5814570225351SNP_A-1997689	12.3130766358507SNP_A-1997709	10.6083801582826SNP_A-1997896	12.0831251156203SNP_A-1997922	10.2282763157933SNP_A-2000230	12.0160468690034SNP_A-2000332	14.4128323731721SNP_A-2000337	10.7379980148828SNP_A-2000342	13.0982726076366SNP_A-4268172	9.62879160029642!sample_table_end
