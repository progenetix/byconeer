Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949539/suppl/GSM949539_15002_Relapse_Ascites.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	13.2345303647993SNP_A-1967418	10.4905987441585SNP_A-1969580	13.3426279930362SNP_A-4263484	12.5116481900792SNP_A-1978185	11.5602805833424SNP_A-4264431	12.0609745810833SNP_A-1980898	11.4834616686109SNP_A-1983139	12.7142699422717SNP_A-4265735	12.5952384700703SNP_A-1995832	13.0810506962776SNP_A-1995893	13.3079582873533SNP_A-1997689	13.1529225979721SNP_A-1997709	11.7069763153911SNP_A-1997896	12.2373507545279SNP_A-1997922	11.8534764220997SNP_A-2000230	13.038894882747SNP_A-2000332	13.9254121864963SNP_A-2000337	11.3794083795393SNP_A-2000342	13.3794758061552SNP_A-4268172	11.2035975829187!sample_table_end
