Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949540/suppl/GSM949540_15002_Primary_Ovarian.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	12.7476621687224SNP_A-1967418	10.9561678588458SNP_A-1969580	13.4077105655409SNP_A-4263484	12.3413594669183SNP_A-1978185	11.7976208616254SNP_A-4264431	12.2410285520648SNP_A-1980898	11.343532877917SNP_A-1983139	12.454387032259SNP_A-4265735	12.6360863440773SNP_A-1995832	12.5877054226181SNP_A-1995893	13.2283221209444SNP_A-1997689	13.0141960589055SNP_A-1997709	11.4131064762003SNP_A-1997896	12.1299586817263SNP_A-1997922	11.7991376229712SNP_A-2000230	13.2123470585484SNP_A-2000332	13.7812964725544SNP_A-2000337	10.7691301023079SNP_A-2000342	13.2957676734875SNP_A-4268172	11.3090773097512!sample_table_end
