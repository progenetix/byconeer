Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949556/suppl/GSM949556_11276_Primary_Ovarian.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	13.4393642241652SNP_A-1967418	11.6057877345641SNP_A-1969580	13.9851242916996SNP_A-4263484	12.6468117022378SNP_A-1978185	11.464837368381SNP_A-4264431	12.6442378582179SNP_A-1980898	11.195664017706SNP_A-1983139	12.5419564625379SNP_A-4265735	13.1055388214887SNP_A-1995832	13.8847809054463SNP_A-1995893	13.7676139743829SNP_A-1997689	13.4479003430531SNP_A-1997709	12.608621549465SNP_A-1997896	12.3474660642312SNP_A-1997922	11.340186557029SNP_A-2000230	13.265829052472SNP_A-2000332	14.3588808099787SNP_A-2000337	12.0586563609931SNP_A-2000342	14.0884516655772SNP_A-4268172	10.6268708140131!sample_table_end
