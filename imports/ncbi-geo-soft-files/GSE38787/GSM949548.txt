Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949548/suppl/GSM949548_11503_Primary_Ovarian.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	12.3128286812981SNP_A-1967418	11.0001344841647SNP_A-1969580	15.103171891201SNP_A-4263484	11.986079423122SNP_A-1978185	12.4433754832151SNP_A-4264431	12.567132716589SNP_A-1980898	11.6277569550328SNP_A-1983139	13.1171988737987SNP_A-4265735	13.0711759094824SNP_A-1995832	14.0024100425518SNP_A-1995893	13.7926963790223SNP_A-1997689	12.4841680776965SNP_A-1997709	11.4725978857375SNP_A-1997896	13.1394237917405SNP_A-1997922	11.3776049369144SNP_A-2000230	12.2765105178978SNP_A-2000332	15.0206449685248SNP_A-2000337	10.8610349241349SNP_A-2000342	13.1738613160297SNP_A-4268172	11.9353669596193!sample_table_end
