Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949554/suppl/GSM949554_11313_Primary_Ovarian.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	14.2756457036944SNP_A-1967418	11.7742944297557SNP_A-1969580	13.9540813548224SNP_A-4263484	13.0482004793506SNP_A-1978185	12.2592655610147SNP_A-4264431	13.0803365998461SNP_A-1980898	11.3883153277003SNP_A-1983139	12.7881172026741SNP_A-4265735	13.0436908412015SNP_A-1995832	13.5585738089367SNP_A-1995893	13.9463686544576SNP_A-1997689	13.3656345533863SNP_A-1997709	12.8635806859338SNP_A-1997896	13.2678146751816SNP_A-1997922	11.4438498245654SNP_A-2000230	13.3637569974467SNP_A-2000332	13.601389505835SNP_A-2000337	11.8416634843092SNP_A-2000342	13.5452336417905SNP_A-4268172	10.5646102808219!sample_table_end
