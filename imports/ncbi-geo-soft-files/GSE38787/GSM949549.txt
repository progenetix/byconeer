Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949549/suppl/GSM949549_11424_Relapse_Ascites.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	13.6566129638056SNP_A-1967418	11.0735156292586SNP_A-1969580	13.3705599739855SNP_A-4263484	11.912122486611SNP_A-1978185	11.9813544010082SNP_A-4264431	12.1805607025248SNP_A-1980898	10.919565687852SNP_A-1983139	12.8500934370496SNP_A-4265735	12.1333024747897SNP_A-1995832	12.9233376421014SNP_A-1995893	13.5486253287701SNP_A-1997689	13.4086383866154SNP_A-1997709	11.6569913818021SNP_A-1997896	12.1662650053346SNP_A-1997922	11.5470325397135SNP_A-2000230	12.9213771661084SNP_A-2000332	13.8684496614448SNP_A-2000337	11.7227436507176SNP_A-2000342	13.3578346660675SNP_A-4268172	10.4020548057999!sample_table_end
