Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949555/suppl/GSM949555_11276_Relapse_Ascites.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	13.3386207843526SNP_A-1967418	11.536103474114SNP_A-1969580	14.1018958662882SNP_A-4263484	12.7698724398987SNP_A-1978185	12.1815879918351SNP_A-4264431	13.2548783927193SNP_A-1980898	11.5566888188562SNP_A-1983139	13.0601162014843SNP_A-4265735	12.9437600726877SNP_A-1995832	13.2904179936653SNP_A-1995893	13.9785272683969SNP_A-1997689	12.6649760608815SNP_A-1997709	12.7393869342437SNP_A-1997896	12.6954504834382SNP_A-1997922	11.7371549002476SNP_A-2000230	12.9188668759112SNP_A-2000332	14.0252656395284SNP_A-2000337	12.0329893825578SNP_A-2000342	13.7734252820098SNP_A-4268172	10.9175291495997!sample_table_end
