Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949564/suppl/GSM949564_10335_Primary_Ovarian.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	12.8237443893209SNP_A-1967418	10.6121962878619SNP_A-1969580	14.6591649527419SNP_A-4263484	12.3442881861387SNP_A-1978185	12.1262699601651SNP_A-4264431	12.8099788569317SNP_A-1980898	11.797666472762SNP_A-1983139	13.8236066989902SNP_A-4265735	12.6998729636863SNP_A-1995832	13.8018807097302SNP_A-1995893	13.893031229108SNP_A-1997689	13.0909413537003SNP_A-1997709	12.3753380452058SNP_A-1997896	13.1091193442339SNP_A-1997922	11.2956725399184SNP_A-2000230	12.1058556106072SNP_A-2000332	14.6898681215896SNP_A-2000337	11.6942392709865SNP_A-2000342	13.7329519951119SNP_A-4268172	10.7182552536423!sample_table_end
