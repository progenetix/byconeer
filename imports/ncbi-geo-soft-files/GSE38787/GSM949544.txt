Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949544/suppl/GSM949544_11995_Primary_Ovarian.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	13.7782930389677SNP_A-1967418	11.6556360797402SNP_A-1969580	13.7047772084SNP_A-4263484	12.1888845960762SNP_A-1978185	11.9867695173726SNP_A-4264431	12.2860025338895SNP_A-1980898	11.4597477819125SNP_A-1983139	13.5105373432814SNP_A-4265735	12.4766566012131SNP_A-1995832	13.5210442075379SNP_A-1995893	13.5934883506028SNP_A-1997689	13.5440724074599SNP_A-1997709	12.3606751153444SNP_A-1997896	12.3905578685554SNP_A-1997922	11.6903740222276SNP_A-2000230	13.2172322252289SNP_A-2000332	14.088424328703SNP_A-2000337	12.1531323366229SNP_A-2000342	13.5181340953404SNP_A-4268172	11.1611994031448!sample_table_end
