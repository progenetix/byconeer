Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949551/suppl/GSM949551_11360_Relapse_Ascites.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	13.6617499416017SNP_A-1967418	11.3586911705219SNP_A-1969580	14.418126309422SNP_A-4263484	13.4648078353896SNP_A-1978185	12.6724649446486SNP_A-4264431	13.1152672245506SNP_A-1980898	12.5765516984512SNP_A-1983139	14.1207246695922SNP_A-4265735	13.0510577205264SNP_A-1995832	14.0429287920447SNP_A-1995893	14.1209328152962SNP_A-1997689	13.2792387606123SNP_A-1997709	13.0083297917772SNP_A-1997896	13.3744250365299SNP_A-1997922	11.2260803676536SNP_A-2000230	13.0402117821976SNP_A-2000332	14.2172390305408SNP_A-2000337	11.8944398722727SNP_A-2000342	13.9257831386878SNP_A-4268172	11.8844952149309!sample_table_end
