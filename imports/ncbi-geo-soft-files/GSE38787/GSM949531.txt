Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949531/suppl/GSM949531_15006_Primary_Ovarian.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	12.7196955711037SNP_A-1967418	10.4810434374639SNP_A-1969580	14.6916903869916SNP_A-4263484	11.6547646094889SNP_A-1978185	11.6935416186984SNP_A-4264431	12.4683612829038SNP_A-1980898	10.8435161709008SNP_A-1983139	12.861955076482SNP_A-4265735	12.652198142489SNP_A-1995832	13.6149015534246SNP_A-1995893	13.7518085066589SNP_A-1997689	12.0294392298997SNP_A-1997709	11.1095565018943SNP_A-1997896	12.4700960554813SNP_A-1997922	10.6475699732636SNP_A-2000230	11.4511462011714SNP_A-2000332	14.7707381859339SNP_A-2000337	10.8813885581882SNP_A-2000342	13.0113538717603SNP_A-4268172	11.0423276809297!sample_table_end
