Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949512/suppl/GSM949512_7899_Lymph_node.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	11.905126672608SNP_A-1967418	11.1832587320072SNP_A-1969580	13.5889659710228SNP_A-4263484	11.586698709667SNP_A-1978185	11.7554848080086SNP_A-4264431	12.3109829816591SNP_A-1980898	10.5097545908563SNP_A-1983139	12.3571206579891SNP_A-4265735	13.7575338611615SNP_A-1995832	13.7331821097519SNP_A-1995893	13.4032974916113SNP_A-1997689	12.9457371747693SNP_A-1997709	10.4030968245338SNP_A-1997896	12.2302787857889SNP_A-1997922	10.7723330004323SNP_A-2000230	12.9147738910201SNP_A-2000332	14.5238801636409SNP_A-2000337	11.8645259482566SNP_A-2000342	13.3997789790158SNP_A-4268172	10.8209290865817!sample_table_end
