Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949536/suppl/GSM949536_15004_Primary_Ovarian.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	12.5116995784739SNP_A-1967418	10.4057295462486SNP_A-1969580	13.366846447187SNP_A-4263484	12.0544721671344SNP_A-1978185	11.5959116845072SNP_A-4264431	11.721004975002SNP_A-1980898	10.1470044186704SNP_A-1983139	11.2838501183888SNP_A-4265735	10.869955713327SNP_A-1995832	11.6797756981688SNP_A-1995893	12.4099392340244SNP_A-1997689	12.2175194998157SNP_A-1997709	10.1076048491843SNP_A-1997896	10.9835365080797SNP_A-1997922	10.407798072407SNP_A-2000230	12.3150483713515SNP_A-2000332	13.2441140941296SNP_A-2000337	10.5251616142038SNP_A-2000342	12.0100576620607SNP_A-4268172	10.2015527728097!sample_table_end
