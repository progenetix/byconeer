Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949500/suppl/GSM949500_9954_Relapse_Ascites.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	13.3807820705365SNP_A-1967418	11.1365648498345SNP_A-1969580	14.4938161231185SNP_A-4263484	12.0227382742996SNP_A-1978185	11.578025612246SNP_A-4264431	12.5422069825639SNP_A-1980898	11.7552339737494SNP_A-1983139	13.0633555793867SNP_A-4265735	12.138545237355SNP_A-1995832	13.5831967639526SNP_A-1995893	14.2279129060884SNP_A-1997689	12.5659433261043SNP_A-1997709	11.1676825932239SNP_A-1997896	12.4741441009012SNP_A-1997922	10.9601070462451SNP_A-2000230	12.3411660167192SNP_A-2000332	14.3576000582873SNP_A-2000337	11.4237869739038SNP_A-2000342	13.2054226396204SNP_A-4268172	10.2221629782361!sample_table_end
