Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949528/suppl/GSM949528_15008_Primary_Ascites.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	12.9321348962948SNP_A-1967418	10.9888119970674SNP_A-1969580	14.3363125939691SNP_A-4263484	11.3762437188398SNP_A-1978185	11.7924526274446SNP_A-4264431	12.5366951895417SNP_A-1980898	11.5611710386644SNP_A-1983139	13.3009983395135SNP_A-4265735	11.7496410387314SNP_A-1995832	13.2686944735807SNP_A-1995893	13.5194084192307SNP_A-1997689	12.2022390832252SNP_A-1997709	9.92784386630646SNP_A-1997896	12.6792309464411SNP_A-1997922	10.4919541115804SNP_A-2000230	12.250330227286SNP_A-2000332	14.3492018454009SNP_A-2000337	11.076891746411SNP_A-2000342	12.9721499017473SNP_A-4268172	10.4543983286918!sample_table_end
