Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949542/suppl/GSM949542_15001_Primary_Ovarian.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	13.2367146660213SNP_A-1967418	11.1768104756102SNP_A-1969580	14.2234152080616SNP_A-4263484	12.7373467949402SNP_A-1978185	11.9605589764697SNP_A-4264431	12.3195977062527SNP_A-1980898	11.5987281507472SNP_A-1983139	13.2196777023906SNP_A-4265735	12.8656655998981SNP_A-1995832	12.9507862724867SNP_A-1995893	13.2630215644054SNP_A-1997689	12.8384129979527SNP_A-1997709	11.4020506408988SNP_A-1997896	12.2848946837623SNP_A-1997922	11.49697394172SNP_A-2000230	13.5566979389192SNP_A-2000332	14.5312272368248SNP_A-2000337	12.1948836722594SNP_A-2000342	13.4457072451875SNP_A-4268172	11.6963872005723!sample_table_end
