Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949559/suppl/GSM949559_11242_Omentum.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	13.2193045857955SNP_A-1967418	10.9264334555735SNP_A-1969580	13.892924075959SNP_A-4263484	12.5683291302842SNP_A-1978185	11.5019586351243SNP_A-4264431	12.4202381995517SNP_A-1980898	11.8383250842432SNP_A-1983139	12.2717632104785SNP_A-4265735	13.1739341886013SNP_A-1995832	13.2534988282525SNP_A-1995893	12.972960334954SNP_A-1997689	12.8025470312471SNP_A-1997709	11.2585868794406SNP_A-1997896	12.2117121735617SNP_A-1997922	11.3480539428976SNP_A-2000230	13.5004158219157SNP_A-2000332	13.9625683642778SNP_A-2000337	12.0585855182662SNP_A-2000342	13.2469759727243SNP_A-4268172	11.6668691264423!sample_table_end
