Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949538/suppl/GSM949538_15003_Primary_Ovarian.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	12.66251202983SNP_A-1967418	10.7259972249142SNP_A-1969580	13.6026050875174SNP_A-4263484	12.368182046502SNP_A-1978185	11.8330036509973SNP_A-4264431	11.6233844342616SNP_A-1980898	11.3566946890813SNP_A-1983139	12.4612208793042SNP_A-4265735	12.0552971664512SNP_A-1995832	12.5754337614879SNP_A-1995893	13.1221715782114SNP_A-1997689	12.9237576308412SNP_A-1997709	11.5645990012286SNP_A-1997896	12.6596165198304SNP_A-1997922	10.9604758135525SNP_A-2000230	12.868636544007SNP_A-2000332	13.7148622957638SNP_A-2000337	11.4229500517183SNP_A-2000342	13.3562073295441SNP_A-4268172	10.5918666506399!sample_table_end
