Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949525/suppl/GSM949525_15009_Primary_Ovarian.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	13.1129278237871SNP_A-1967418	11.0552743251386SNP_A-1969580	14.0585688391696SNP_A-4263484	12.0218412489467SNP_A-1978185	11.8697873538551SNP_A-4264431	12.1833088667408SNP_A-1980898	11.1705148195688SNP_A-1983139	12.2356473219498SNP_A-4265735	11.9135294206846SNP_A-1995832	13.5922663146153SNP_A-1995893	13.1698854066709SNP_A-1997689	12.7053433056147SNP_A-1997709	10.8633084443817SNP_A-1997896	12.9117456279793SNP_A-1997922	10.4626836135533SNP_A-2000230	12.2530509468688SNP_A-2000332	13.7408164045627SNP_A-2000337	11.7306045717528SNP_A-2000342	13.1907518551223SNP_A-4268172	10.9239551609859!sample_table_end
