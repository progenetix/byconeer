Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949543/suppl/GSM949543_11995_Relapse_Ascites.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	13.8026443499729SNP_A-1967418	11.2478646569413SNP_A-1969580	13.679817568854SNP_A-4263484	12.8483850191884SNP_A-1978185	12.9658866010801SNP_A-4264431	12.0109000833288SNP_A-1980898	11.507716622223SNP_A-1983139	13.6813472699655SNP_A-4265735	12.702012105333SNP_A-1995832	13.5591555644244SNP_A-1995893	13.5574679086046SNP_A-1997689	13.669843968638SNP_A-1997709	13.0723441172572SNP_A-1997896	12.2348506066888SNP_A-1997922	11.0455760418661SNP_A-2000230	13.4935807546324SNP_A-2000332	13.9451298044418SNP_A-2000337	11.9799346823716SNP_A-2000342	13.6220453382276SNP_A-4268172	10.8823099125719!sample_table_end
