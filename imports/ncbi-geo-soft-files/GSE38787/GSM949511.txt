Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949511/suppl/GSM949511_7899_Omentum.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	12.5180563943221SNP_A-1967418	11.0413847678568SNP_A-1969580	14.0673371932171SNP_A-4263484	13.0259718739839SNP_A-1978185	11.7722229413299SNP_A-4264431	12.5852893453865SNP_A-1980898	11.7164544285235SNP_A-1983139	12.6933815640106SNP_A-4265735	12.8406831435998SNP_A-1995832	13.3538645519607SNP_A-1995893	13.2513895127312SNP_A-1997689	12.6505304947467SNP_A-1997709	11.3143336121771SNP_A-1997896	12.3785263872273SNP_A-1997922	11.4149824637808SNP_A-2000230	13.1839581888813SNP_A-2000332	13.7976088896999SNP_A-2000337	11.6391169926648SNP_A-2000342	13.3164322189869SNP_A-4268172	11.4222570369835!sample_table_end
