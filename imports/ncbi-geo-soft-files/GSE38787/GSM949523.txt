Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949523/suppl/GSM949523_4065_Relapse_Ascites.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	13.6947775360892SNP_A-1967418	11.5202405154907SNP_A-1969580	13.4735124117173SNP_A-4263484	13.2353940220929SNP_A-1978185	13.0410152197803SNP_A-4264431	11.8257719774598SNP_A-1980898	11.6010325004618SNP_A-1983139	13.6554399902313SNP_A-4265735	12.4593695784708SNP_A-1995832	12.7308578592923SNP_A-1995893	13.7272364115231SNP_A-1997689	13.896579084984SNP_A-1997709	12.3407282483724SNP_A-1997896	11.8313757724468SNP_A-1997922	11.5463287007901SNP_A-2000230	13.4848600084329SNP_A-2000332	13.9417952092656SNP_A-2000337	12.0133797568907SNP_A-2000342	13.8277186220123SNP_A-4268172	9.65015607669442!sample_table_end
