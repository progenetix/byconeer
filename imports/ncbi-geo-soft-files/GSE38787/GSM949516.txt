Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949516/suppl/GSM949516_6496_Left_ovary.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	12.5696953622907SNP_A-1967418	10.9354885416852SNP_A-1969580	13.745052932372SNP_A-4263484	12.3986078849878SNP_A-1978185	11.5153451683454SNP_A-4264431	12.2124883700409SNP_A-1980898	11.3821186929913SNP_A-1983139	12.4399096179421SNP_A-4265735	12.7068288079942SNP_A-1995832	13.1281820652476SNP_A-1995893	12.9226699601721SNP_A-1997689	12.5948501049865SNP_A-1997709	11.1024121147339SNP_A-1997896	12.5260789012812SNP_A-1997922	11.32982671589SNP_A-2000230	13.0222272566677SNP_A-2000332	13.7556908832965SNP_A-2000337	11.9845191145452SNP_A-2000342	13.1269347524628SNP_A-4268172	11.1238656452878!sample_table_end
