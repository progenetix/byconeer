Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949546/suppl/GSM949546_11709_Primary_Ovarian.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	12.846792391546SNP_A-1967418	11.0911530334891SNP_A-1969580	14.8691919622629SNP_A-4263484	10.6828919561844SNP_A-1978185	12.0141270863045SNP_A-4264431	12.6398629824567SNP_A-1980898	11.9124280692546SNP_A-1983139	13.1037955569281SNP_A-4265735	12.4503184600133SNP_A-1995832	13.9342202389826SNP_A-1995893	13.6647640962693SNP_A-1997689	11.8973855393148SNP_A-1997709	10.5461705311481SNP_A-1997896	12.7918189785574SNP_A-1997922	10.5926042825469SNP_A-2000230	12.0256436362316SNP_A-2000332	14.7482979999498SNP_A-2000337	10.8867407422106SNP_A-2000342	12.8435321766141SNP_A-4268172	10.4720218122656!sample_table_end
