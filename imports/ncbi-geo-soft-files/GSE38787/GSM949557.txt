Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949557/suppl/GSM949557_11242_Right_Ovary.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	13.0222587560306SNP_A-1967418	10.7424094648743SNP_A-1969580	14.5316649939292SNP_A-4263484	13.0285261289149SNP_A-1978185	10.954727117621SNP_A-4264431	12.1573911935608SNP_A-1980898	11.8055126474493SNP_A-1983139	12.1948788642035SNP_A-4265735	12.5872764477734SNP_A-1995832	12.8875080909669SNP_A-1995893	13.2400641484125SNP_A-1997689	12.2532280093824SNP_A-1997709	11.3460253571596SNP_A-1997896	12.2880149756404SNP_A-1997922	10.6057273849219SNP_A-2000230	13.1876122880973SNP_A-2000332	14.4858984493478SNP_A-2000337	12.2164542848998SNP_A-2000342	13.411645585811SNP_A-4268172	11.2482516009741!sample_table_end
