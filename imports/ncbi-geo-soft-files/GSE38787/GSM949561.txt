Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949561/suppl/GSM949561_10336_Relapse_Ascites.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	13.9470425884005SNP_A-1967418	11.4171181491626SNP_A-1969580	13.8544566716008SNP_A-4263484	12.6852608112666SNP_A-1978185	12.4186468519917SNP_A-4264431	12.3540486372921SNP_A-1980898	11.6548174805778SNP_A-1983139	13.2921497254895SNP_A-4265735	13.2279212765539SNP_A-1995832	13.3207045731847SNP_A-1995893	13.5591394563528SNP_A-1997689	14.0248927840312SNP_A-1997709	13.2785260258558SNP_A-1997896	11.9242571603003SNP_A-1997922	11.5995402619294SNP_A-2000230	13.618474002779SNP_A-2000332	14.1409651618366SNP_A-2000337	12.1832690317322SNP_A-2000342	13.827714455376SNP_A-4268172	10.6235613758245!sample_table_end
