Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949527/suppl/GSM949527_15008_Primary_Ovarian.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	13.1352348845493SNP_A-1967418	10.87062039544SNP_A-1969580	14.8472867874345SNP_A-4263484	11.8818877604034SNP_A-1978185	11.9139584808121SNP_A-4264431	12.8019887267903SNP_A-1980898	12.2632661911629SNP_A-1983139	13.4289212392359SNP_A-4265735	12.4927607568437SNP_A-1995832	13.6010360153944SNP_A-1995893	13.9948063316469SNP_A-1997689	12.4097135961595SNP_A-1997709	11.1878881582635SNP_A-1997896	13.0995696569225SNP_A-1997922	9.98093455730394SNP_A-2000230	11.8427810585587SNP_A-2000332	14.3594584263606SNP_A-2000337	11.0045320123226SNP_A-2000342	13.0925627937343SNP_A-4268172	10.5560599801165!sample_table_end
