Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949529/suppl/GSM949529_15007_Primary_Ovarian.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	12.7283065785725SNP_A-1967418	10.8195794006894SNP_A-1969580	14.5106039819992SNP_A-4263484	10.9781196096011SNP_A-1978185	11.7295746927921SNP_A-4264431	12.4542120517712SNP_A-1980898	11.6316000579937SNP_A-1983139	13.2579618133345SNP_A-4265735	12.2585746596715SNP_A-1995832	13.6809714331339SNP_A-1995893	13.7576439276009SNP_A-1997689	12.2023997732383SNP_A-1997709	10.7067502014643SNP_A-1997896	12.6130828275425SNP_A-1997922	10.945036546301SNP_A-2000230	11.9720830099347SNP_A-2000332	14.4060075979072SNP_A-2000337	10.7218857321265SNP_A-2000342	12.9145563960363SNP_A-4268172	9.9856489670269!sample_table_end
