Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949545/suppl/GSM949545_11709_Relapse_Ascites.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	12.392753570365SNP_A-1967418	10.2219596480827SNP_A-1969580	14.9856620814656SNP_A-4263484	10.0064923334445SNP_A-1978185	11.9486329767027SNP_A-4264431	12.5247239112682SNP_A-1980898	11.4227073227263SNP_A-1983139	13.2120345506912SNP_A-4265735	12.2292886814999SNP_A-1995832	13.7713957693651SNP_A-1995893	13.5374183180226SNP_A-1997689	11.7957833446895SNP_A-1997709	10.617876911125SNP_A-1997896	12.7135942869759SNP_A-1997922	10.4254139016556SNP_A-2000230	11.6401263107302SNP_A-2000332	14.8328190469465SNP_A-2000337	10.4129652976853SNP_A-2000342	12.8183442237652SNP_A-4268172	11.1074155252433!sample_table_end
