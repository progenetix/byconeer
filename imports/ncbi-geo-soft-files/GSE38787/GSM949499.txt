Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949499/suppl/GSM949499_9965_Primary_Ovarian.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	13.2235575017603SNP_A-1967418	11.6626834768096SNP_A-1969580	13.9547091047936SNP_A-4263484	12.5921411676922SNP_A-1978185	12.1635808885128SNP_A-4264431	12.3494028605787SNP_A-1980898	11.9143583047511SNP_A-1983139	13.5402568334007SNP_A-4265735	12.4679393249368SNP_A-1995832	13.6808272505576SNP_A-1995893	13.769536730278SNP_A-1997689	13.1834665298802SNP_A-1997709	12.6185547687689SNP_A-1997896	12.2992600119005SNP_A-1997922	11.4358099979579SNP_A-2000230	12.9028483446201SNP_A-2000332	14.1780394405629SNP_A-2000337	11.9111223109884SNP_A-2000342	13.4783379799357SNP_A-4268172	11.0101597895823!sample_table_end
