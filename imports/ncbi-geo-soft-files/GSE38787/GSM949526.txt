Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949526/suppl/GSM949526_15009_Primary_Ascites.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	12.8891280207385SNP_A-1967418	11.2021405676605SNP_A-1969580	13.9132825163407SNP_A-4263484	12.0802300486695SNP_A-1978185	11.8051758786389SNP_A-4264431	12.4563045267914SNP_A-1980898	11.7283015956458SNP_A-1983139	12.3415089148897SNP_A-4265735	12.4299564225411SNP_A-1995832	13.3621990842186SNP_A-1995893	13.5521133404158SNP_A-1997689	12.526688709367SNP_A-1997709	11.8365486378408SNP_A-1997896	12.9670606951598SNP_A-1997922	10.2786116633595SNP_A-2000230	12.6744539308592SNP_A-2000332	14.1364597118565SNP_A-2000337	11.5717417667464SNP_A-2000342	13.1735296840959SNP_A-4268172	10.9941351817855!sample_table_end
