Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949550/suppl/GSM949550_11424_Primary_Ovarian.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	13.3175126729282SNP_A-1967418	11.4030587167442SNP_A-1969580	13.7812023064158SNP_A-4263484	11.9954448210694SNP_A-1978185	11.5751416168412SNP_A-4264431	12.4811548227437SNP_A-1980898	11.3117092404505SNP_A-1983139	13.2475272995677SNP_A-4265735	12.1546697980737SNP_A-1995832	13.3028364939502SNP_A-1995893	13.4390916402212SNP_A-1997689	13.3283041717569SNP_A-1997709	11.8388602745687SNP_A-1997896	12.5185179754317SNP_A-1997922	11.6364036914812SNP_A-2000230	12.7493832526049SNP_A-2000332	13.8316726600872SNP_A-2000337	11.8637196227591SNP_A-2000342	13.2163106966994SNP_A-4268172	10.6090450144427!sample_table_end
