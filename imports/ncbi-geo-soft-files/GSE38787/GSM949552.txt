Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949552/suppl/GSM949552_11360_Primary_Ovarian.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	12.7384707232481SNP_A-1967418	11.0926789213418SNP_A-1969580	14.0868477811341SNP_A-4263484	12.5319796353142SNP_A-1978185	11.92748067763SNP_A-4264431	12.7894381243929SNP_A-1980898	12.1018166982667SNP_A-1983139	12.7724025760089SNP_A-4265735	12.786882592386SNP_A-1995832	13.6779786230067SNP_A-1995893	13.8196769414306SNP_A-1997689	12.7919418566834SNP_A-1997709	12.0363394820864SNP_A-1997896	13.0399013231035SNP_A-1997922	10.8502965446173SNP_A-2000230	12.7953886068823SNP_A-2000332	14.102786447539SNP_A-2000337	11.7065935024796SNP_A-2000342	13.4434466886258SNP_A-4268172	11.4601007573742!sample_table_end
