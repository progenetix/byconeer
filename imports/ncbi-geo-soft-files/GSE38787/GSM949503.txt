Systematic biases including allelic-crosstalk and fragment length biases were removed using the methods available in this package. The resultant values were log2 transformed to obtain the normalized values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Prof David,,Bowtell PhD.!Sample_contact_email = d.bowtell@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = +613 96561287!Sample_contact_fax = +613 96561414!Sample_contact_department = Research Division!Sample_contact_institute = PeterMacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = Locked Bag 1 A' Beckett St!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.petermac-research.org.au!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM949nnn/GSM949503/suppl/GSM949503_8794_Primary_Ovarian.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38787!Sample_data_row_count = 1879489#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 RMA!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	13.3662137422737SNP_A-1967418	11.2983788040979SNP_A-1969580	13.9027574640948SNP_A-4263484	12.2564894583896SNP_A-1978185	11.6097894700899SNP_A-4264431	12.3458495825126SNP_A-1980898	11.6798788696396SNP_A-1983139	13.3366118407415SNP_A-4265735	12.2557625120131SNP_A-1995832	13.424689653991SNP_A-1995893	13.8274055093788SNP_A-1997689	13.2735398041628SNP_A-1997709	12.3384388003847SNP_A-1997896	12.2762189904124SNP_A-1997922	11.1945921549046SNP_A-2000230	12.8703607683868SNP_A-2000332	13.9383978775872SNP_A-2000337	11.886929269598SNP_A-2000342	13.4135850628464SNP_A-4268172	10.8422731252587!sample_table_end
