Normalization was performed against an own set of 30 Sty and 30 Nsp reference samples, respectively. In one case (UPN23) dermal cells were used for paired tumor-germline analysis (UPN23_2).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Frank,,Stegelmann!Sample_contact_email = frank.stegelmann@uniklinik-ulm.de!Sample_contact_department = Internal Medicine III!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital of Ulm!Sample_contact_address = Albert-Einstein-Allee 23!Sample_contact_city = Ulm!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 89081!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454966/suppl/GSM454966_UPN67.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454966/suppl/GSM454966_UPN67.CHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18197!Sample_data_row_count = 262338#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotypes: AA, AB, BB, No Call#CONFIDENCE = #RAS1 = Relative allele signal for the data in the first probe group#RAS2 = Relative allele signal for the data in the second probe group#P-VALUE AA = #P-VALUE AB = #P-VALUE BB = #P-VALUE NO CALL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	RAS1	RAS2	P-VALUE AA	P-VALUE AB	P-VALUE BB	P-VALUE NO CALLAFFX-5Q-123	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-456	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-789	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-ABC	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeA	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeB	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeC	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeD	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeE	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeF	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeG	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeH	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeI	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeJ	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeK	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeL	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeM	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeN	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeO	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeP	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0!sample_table_end
