Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415048/suppl/GSM415048_NN862.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415048/suppl/GSM415048_NN863.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16606!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	4875.8655835494874	6460.2282512995025	4808.0959426817699	6539.5634808893919	1.526180582974332	2.0423270861952765	0.74727529850152852	-0.4366	0.738889643160030582	2250.215836709121	2562.5338549117282	2349.9326401887083	2507.8766313023511	0.71392593727426135	0.77745928353365423	0.91828080568975201	-0.3082	0.807676363760407193	3675.2548963346985	3414.0972684700009	3714.7522381861354	3365.0093409544356	1.1311131269564472	1.0404669320423441	1.0871206879551403	0.3383	1.26430132895340314	10195.748188081754	12793.939050999235	9243.2274495959482	13003.658018427028	2.8655966010649871	4.169679673285974	0.68724622167599603	-0.3642	0.776901733091622585	10277.588740636242	10682.819600853558	9298.8516988197061	10895.915719672726	2.9867307419334521	3.503139220937626	0.85258693804753938	-0.1793	0.883117601150676836	13564.393114041435	10431.528210668826	11895.048686998251	10632.060954525965	3.8016037639792009	3.3677353520318873	1.1288309105659218	0.2611	1.19838331458391567	3735.9251386489927	3063.0611758312475	3766.6990389887214	3011.0775298338663	1.174573943289797	0.95310869776349061	1.2323609532113011	0.4076	1.32647067102444018	2169.086614036456	2505.7591088350491	2270.312340884891	2450.6705607124291	0.68745777133150177	0.7776276996526319	0.88404486059150256	-0.0923	0.937995149678337759	3354.9717239208221	3868.9754456944665	3415.5680577295789	3844.0943808648035	1.0231165135590745	1.1592472611167555	0.88256970525292422	-0.0118	0.9918438249798506910	10209.913873697868	8838.0905952531248	9252.4327164074712	8999.8939326147884	2.969748376451613	2.9882131288527463	0.99382080474018164	0.0571	1.040359325999181911	11764.471481069857	10439.644506665551	10481.200720351741	10647.705062986839	3.250676350551581	3.3291389381261367	0.97643156713107337	0.0251	1.017559202839617912	23059.916544334883	16942.335992301054	21402.880895131984	16829.307860979152	7.1585793625401752	5.8146945411227415	1.2311187306423743	0.3812	1.302457081774339513	4194.0385898642808	3933.3641643370997	4194.9978307884385	3905.1965748171219	1.3439171724445298	1.2718154595750188	1.0566919613428856	0.0894	1.063939680206087214	7688.8488547004154	8070.4882019259594	7218.1734417547823	8207.3583317413813	2.1531336612305378	2.5467036639205336	0.84545905035369806	0.0520	1.036687744206304115	3404.5399627242546	3461.9785120842239	3457.3262812867542	3415.8042230099927	1.0942288410302388	1.12527174119607	0.97241297454707687	-0.0012	0.999179223435084716	3644.5519355689103	4677.9201987762717	3686.7297172023964	4679.0092382348048	1.1430436087022222	1.4221728412661223	0.80373044368123425	-0.0902	0.9394057277090830417	605.37165070938227	673.19689217986411	670.89523381618824	647.11794742998495	0.18133515719100901	0.1725473892151102	1.050929591087254	0.1486	1.108515112517734418	5283.126096827421	6514.5284511758264	5162.1355762774519	6592.4632045900789	1.5424069113148267	2.0068828049899112	0.76855853639275185	-0.0676	0.9542427254952161619	2078.7582262617893	2505.6543675652715	2179.8323624997479	2449.9099391933819	0.82638337571533715	0.93714806578413001	0.88180662788210118	-0.1646	0.8921576389183625320	1607.1613413600901	2350.8567681203494	1710.8231778174368	2294.8817123445856	0.62579178359038667	0.88017531475605693	0.71098538336516126	-0.1466	0.90336015171745199!sample_table_end
