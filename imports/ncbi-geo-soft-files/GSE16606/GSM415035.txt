Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415035/suppl/GSM415035_NN844.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415035/suppl/GSM415035_NN845.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16606!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3628.3110867540336	5457.8978095266948	3679.1202981515712	5203.0953219893318	1.5022505115259777	2.2030086112777458	0.68190859710469842	-0.3663	0.77576896553475352	1236.0086065409619	1618.0397976578738	1311.8122884948796	1596.2470460566519	0.53872242048421592	0.68854167278106482	0.78241077015466753	-0.3523	0.783355471996913583	2455.3347464331487	3383.5661256233379	2532.367135474643	3280.0594213336944	1.0224633806270369	1.3551770497604059	0.75448693645439735	-0.2054	0.867302428011239024	6549.7275980253844	10285.177970133354	6419.3901480618551	9576.9504555246513	2.3294023010640794	3.5980182797823246	0.64741258101807242	-0.3746	0.771305140576990845	6322.5226867690617	8684.4412835842104	6211.2977921039464	8120.2498574813953	2.390484538937161	3.2179194826024347	0.74286648620676476	-0.4846	0.714686514309924476	6879.307288810769	8877.043261748915	6718.6872043535477	8307.413067569365	2.9482531477596536	3.6600062145993388	0.80553227915280967	-0.3050	0.809431283490547717	1681.3307437286057	2167.0018411925689	1758.9655007478268	2123.8802755963388	0.67162175320681328	0.82789455948877055	0.81124068942009164	-0.1191	0.920790434842817758	1336.0707751044888	1832.2511517172215	1413.4955308371511	1802.6906306510859	0.56212312410498932	0.73676375646546044	0.76296250890748285	-0.3927	0.761720982982891489	2621.2095523378889	2978.0648275782141	2696.610005304462	2899.2149362200862	0.98242238919809877	1.1222065046637326	0.87543815252833534	0.0526	1.037113574418077310	7049.9435433083918	7414.4762866828387	6875.2192699815569	6974.5911724241541	2.7244709968580527	2.8317428132539875	0.96211809353100552	-0.0890	0.940192702043697211	12580.582850350153	15335.436533349422	12028.49093788061	14397.097383904646	4.3529613866702359	5.0188585220652815	0.86732099889497849	-0.3140	0.8043952869330853712	10737.899314711764	18188.861637067574	10213.265462988933	17171.005543838775	3.8542811329601143	6.3454878659499627	0.60740501193647822	-0.7377	0.5997044514764423613	3020.3300204675197	3605.0667649358816	3089.4816794400126	3486.5386392014225	1.2772267597157749	1.4740032679710302	0.86650198643988163	-0.1761	0.8851118258729400214	5257.8496502425442	9264.1627118835386	5229.8934647803198	8649.1044057921154	1.9256036257466433	3.1731423851520102	0.60684438074921021	-0.5455	0.6851527257825031915	2882.6843052533145	3134.5166403994726	2952.9408058901658	3041.9586416332259	1.2593432069316481	1.3624878823634758	0.92429681264180863	-0.0090	0.9937957668526624716	2267.6695505336006	3123.6769885487402	2345.9100041342008	3031.5559416622973	0.90147594435454004	1.1867254222154671	0.75963312783137138	-0.2348	0.8497861837083400317	765.18439949037747	727.65005010963796	833.33550638069278	730.81358315661862	0.29776624280969577	0.2710573546334793	1.0985359287237635	0.1191	1.086074519596064418	3423.463088412203	4673.1845825580358	3481.6053058074899	4481.2161717538802	1.3167166336945209	1.776429101366904	0.74121541506010591	-0.1967	0.8725559347271206719	2102.2068951433776	2442.0427408146306	2180.8319988422704	2386.8715428665751	0.85273635647527668	0.92705744990839467	0.91983118905903649	-0.0905	0.9392163786555153320	1342.4183533528796	2113.5009462961802	1418.653322236544	2071.6156306801554	0.56168743768393536	0.83889424990850758	0.66955690511073918	-0.3777	0.76965228656679241!sample_table_end
