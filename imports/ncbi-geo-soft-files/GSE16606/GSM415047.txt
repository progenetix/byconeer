Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415047/suppl/GSM415047_NN860.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415047/suppl/GSM415047_NN861.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16606!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3631.4799498759107	6249.8380940482393	3875.0509155272057	5964.6855771787777	1.4139498567502202	2.1388321933884726	0.66108498886495237	-0.4101	0.752590931174376142	2149.5015971314319	1619.5304576041265	2463.2479171986511	1436.0520029193867	0.96792330096027435	0.59738657862344469	1.6202628843631808	0.2798	1.21400352052029173	3564.0519282080782	3930.1144862775836	3799.4587890184976	3593.8040284253134	1.5298284994237203	1.5225788427537119	1.0047614326867282	0.1525	1.11152463704879374	10937.150715975447	9666.5687619899709	9510.9035215871936	9366.6971319340773	3.081418668243904	3.0509175970924942	1.0099973434813436	-0.0699	0.952694077124488395	9716.1873099921977	7020.7072581234288	8653.1532695841506	6742.2533515659798	3.4172611518027991	2.8165129373444029	1.2132950310623538	0.1744	1.12849339551570976	5883.4989075106296	9863.08334490792	5768.8168815171657	9586.2938010235302	2.1911431315297114	3.8741018578365876	0.56558738307239809	-0.6574	0.633998618402505497	2377.2520218975924	3526.1545400864379	2691.5472531752539	3189.8270018992562	0.87804236540498626	1.0658672335826085	0.82378211632765685	-0.0928	0.937700164977245848	1095.9329750653615	1831.1331899627119	1341.3988002901863	1611.4189576240808	0.47818170094435747	0.6045648778554843	0.79095183736204799	-0.2606	0.834755477455101599	2330.8509230332611	4107.2976057798196	2646.9176210949322	3765.0330738241328	0.96853365157064297	1.4627699640518002	0.66212301002397722	-0.4229	0.7459453195463702210	13173.443642501765	12494.539763491606	11275.718689709731	12134.794665749643	3.6158402663685183	3.9485100042935271	0.91574803215307277	-0.2090	0.8651591589418251611	15060.248521663858	16144.646368004815	12861.871846997616	15559.512002311541	4.178073466496393	5.1419143795184006	0.81255212711023772	-0.2567	0.8369879427934749912	18529.258340846874	17605.081920983568	15648.676332629921	16924.243658974458	5.1445500077180322	5.6360182525932849	0.91279867756831412	0.0217	1.015121278869337813	3598.1009635737037	5366.7376203525246	3842.5746602581676	5051.3183456174884	1.3399744952768373	1.8320977053466894	0.73138811940342052	-0.2657	0.8318216987233791914	8553.787231956625	8592.979038182104	7797.0548647969526	8354.6006822936906	2.4231560910478005	2.6346685548745858	0.91971951711517896	0.0332	1.023253001489130815	3758.1169950979161	4528.7378119268078	3988.3263729083542	4190.8621863432218	1.3595767817384008	1.4792104498155987	0.91912329439525564	-0.0101	0.9929931628188125616	3203.7064517148374	3944.1448369838181	3485.4054064144702	3604.1844879378	1.2518906795197209	1.3312445685057919	0.94039120168945456	-0.0069	0.9952125477920080717	688.64872212972386	735.67287504156673	866.02415170134782	666.40506587725179	0.43009587707327551	0.37738500900310923	1.1396739849561222	0.4352	1.352088944160670318	3192.1073190612497	5041.4394690503341	3450.2466993219473	4718.7212820702916	1.2887643932604484	1.8054501319778331	0.71381888119426151	-0.2491	0.8414408585743179419	2294.4738979255039	3790.6163639673186	2609.4076212591885	3452.9014371271155	0.84700967447586539	1.1905708211193509	0.71143157504861732	-0.3470	0.7862102979367312520	1557.0205851403837	2369.4546738116383	1848.5008735164595	2090.1114773872414	0.67388449094262581	0.75262668944569155	0.89537681880367637	-0.0993	0.93348957536332222!sample_table_end
