Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415023/suppl/GSM415023_NN840.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415023/suppl/GSM415023_NN841.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16606!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3149.1975565910825	6566.4220320691202	3415.8604164642747	5925.3527866808927	1.3241726301697891	2.291292826323132	0.57791505954946243	-0.5819	0.668093206649457372	1683.8238744774176	1586.6396659861025	1911.6953035866134	1441.605183698819	0.69293503824936542	0.55100335525540312	1.2575876927794269	-0.1085	0.927566174222618893	2798.4894474510811	4650.6236381170866	3061.0188164676847	4222.8887374945498	1.1174566044224035	1.5837848479954173	0.70556086316696276	-0.2666	0.83125934925934224	7690.377749757833	12270.623181879799	7726.5564660584205	10736.139772981252	2.5722470700481646	3.653835944100472	0.70398537575321252	-0.3540	0.782404707587072485	7440.4342159701537	11250.192486734226	7501.4996901366485	9890.4633787413695	3.1024959007081039	4.2712949671947857	0.72635955243936201	-0.4738	0.720049684313317176	7211.1740003583191	14203.438760013101	7294.3632271144725	12344.141078508832	2.6568865057777646	4.5722963528173262	0.58108361767510164	-0.6599	0.632911447578526697	1521.9609401938344	2663.8464053503658	1741.6875315210077	2417.3440212217633	0.69521751120074027	1.0622965799667072	0.65444766020288669	-0.4015	0.757045850589421098	1568.96576749723	2209.6086925708328	1792.3144132362615	2006.4339959541778	0.61944831780675647	0.70224825002806701	0.88209307432521011	0.1085	1.07807104847443989	1831.2375079107367	3105.3176452594503	2067.6619411695424	2822.1131092460751	0.85346715577411425	1.2312376126211535	0.6931782679682662	-0.4387	0.7378075059419254610	9367.9567572719479	13171.551005909701	9234.7578860354733	11489.521349580169	3.2353744105858833	4.1185056173696255	0.78556998852710702	-0.2249	0.8556403632391107511	9549.3018652876854	14961.185931468128	9387.4441211642115	12998.720156515399	4.0406028110055212	5.6764928760557636	0.71181324441528804	-0.3599	0.779231402493632112	11652.130886782275	24628.523600176813	11329.473439319987	21194.809842529154	4.8061998100666727	9.0056873634905958	0.53368494997407889	-0.7225	0.606029654800859813	3337.6687153167782	4983.3824275415163	3604.8208591266348	4523.328488902077	1.2764307022475117	1.6273325013558275	0.78436994356349499	-0.3990	0.7583710665031688814	7543.7286550361387	10102.173493698845	7594.3670012321954	8931.6490370625179	2.6166577851182651	3.1966772212133048	0.81855552001121579	-0.1651	0.8918752619537518915	2421.2905716030041	3007.7513221677741	2677.3270090244405	2731.2709136303215	0.97884756672256534	1.0212102468610291	0.95851718069939362	-0.1258	0.9165235091205381516	2132.027034809927	3803.4420308644767	2379.36135591826	3455.6904511278394	1.0122264758013249	1.4828787590559043	0.68260905999204757	-0.4386	0.7378649418185275817	387.69839047886472	533.24172264825893	478.7698798689633	476.02970420701189	0.20198078175832632	0.20279600125294958	0.9959801007436706	0.1583	1.115978917015567418	3298.1792623985166	4947.5085134026049	3565.4147432695836	4491.9290345487852	1.3197729848568025	1.8142464877242088	0.72744965680618512	-0.1516	0.9002586090201762919	1667.0274216543785	2710.2969858312435	1895.2479527200833	2462.9225833109176	0.76002356693386919	1.0022790136058428	0.7582954013968376	-0.4264	0.7441078901300045620	1015.9399669801095	1831.4522457301593	1202.4913485255365	1660.6760440587498	0.58378003475269902	0.82603619651416604	0.70672452032516664	-0.4709	0.72153253440986043!sample_table_end
