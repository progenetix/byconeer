Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415046/suppl/GSM415046_NN856.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415046/suppl/GSM415046_NN857.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16606!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	5323.5355301013742	6754.7179980334813	5316.2231215740485	6576.003822428388	1.8194652075581439	2.2648480613492725	0.80334978694959613	-0.2590	0.835691550883080782	1333.8978969915377	1552.2986082925952	1382.7804607748599	1544.6552105832347	0.48952577812526604	0.56728046777792041	0.86293430839030083	-0.3164	0.803061489916051533	3042.3770545935627	3227.0861582113153	3089.1097239671931	3182.4255337820132	0.98000085269659309	1.0464923596105316	0.93646250132329278	-0.0225	0.984522667565344464	6573.0179320316893	9587.4415691177892	6513.8553712683943	9312.4341992822428	2.128301847403439	3.0247208166410982	0.70363579861459169	-0.3831	0.766763157315620175	9707.0127950771366	10445.757116404699	9482.7366659271502	10134.63811366421	3.2164628771808306	3.5940855916690335	0.89493218654460527	-0.2910	0.81735619281058686	6454.8367366315942	10633.472522218186	6402.2790253128869	10313.679859406342	2.2435777597383204	3.5999462923861771	0.62322534213453351	-0.6880	0.620718519115401887	1597.4184262769018	2846.7316168183747	1647.028099138281	2811.1130786941594	0.52187716580880683	0.88193519845363066	0.59174094278565681	-0.6960	0.61728224746914548	1350.9703114476804	1488.2791338859336	1398.1252302765865	1480.571285810187	0.49574970627225629	0.54013248091952692	0.91782983579933386	-0.0982	0.934178211213525739	4664.2677050714101	5138.6779933677135	4677.987494344402	5019.9015922678745	1.483804402903139	1.6508409714271968	0.89881728681615525	-0.1088	0.9273533427221810610	7663.8498649267967	7970.4048067052154	7558.6513111847853	7754.1680023083709	2.4738783437889893	2.5356657803396168	0.97563265749386263	-0.1414	0.9066255136040721811	15401.595880663317	17489.934085000525	14939.499450793675	17077.124202508156	4.4726033161499466	4.9800617978880179	0.89810197095279476	-0.1924	0.8751483917724908212	12097.667660968662	22450.638916409607	11744.342217256331	22089.553187012621	3.6956482055148578	7.1521990062816574	0.51671495749335716	-0.7327	0.6017713593975803113	3891.7722220179476	4065.3294726596955	3925.7236647415352	3992.7390451463589	1.3797976331614756	1.4190970176224109	0.97230676692790285	-0.0773	0.9478621579913698614	6802.966998892638	8189.0755260353844	6736.6889510668261	7959.5702531061406	2.2987702772754246	2.7714024136970443	0.82946102158035973	-0.2840	0.8213011406394895615	3676.3912274101176	3974.1120292684172	3715.0268047771906	3904.1976629629203	1.1913729042062309	1.2991748810158772	0.917022736211347	0.0253	1.017659949560926916	2573.7387914606866	3071.6424492276715	2626.9723142559224	3031.0084858101077	0.77153884500653891	0.90292809199523461	0.85448537025981786	-0.1431	0.9055660482607498217	1085.4462179904347	1068.6396239720682	1131.587146940147	1070.6454804091602	0.32806680193718879	0.29943799264855808	1.095608473178056	0.1103	1.079444667375517418	3732.4893635361218	5122.4595931794365	3769.635462775896	5005.9431661167937	1.3205921374516476	1.7210981581196008	0.7672962353840822	-0.3214	0.8002888036910186219	2643.3184094646567	2982.2587443419097	2695.7672663726166	2944.7782508478049	0.97194647572927839	1.0862613611237739	0.89476300134966336	-0.0781	0.9472734727755343120	1911.0798256614548	2350.3187529937777	1965.3315219354458	2327.124342453862	0.61426474914679174	0.74496304143769376	0.82455734711527562	-0.0446	0.96955911657611993!sample_table_end
