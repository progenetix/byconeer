Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415045/suppl/GSM415045_NN852.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415045/suppl/GSM415045_NN853.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16606!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1953.2620871848383	5240.868532579876	2229.0795678948552	4823.8138181240256	1.0180048024372628	2.2346351535191609	0.45555749932336048	-0.7366	0.60014595954179142	2930.3090557512955	2828.683286398556	3166.3485463814245	2530.2937556577431	1.2445297510967177	1.0263623833290278	1.2125636824881085	0.0308	1.02160733522926543	2177.6010532121809	2953.4956455760362	2449.419340922303	2643.3440528442979	1.0149834065123262	1.0835975950054153	0.93667927207539992	-0.0475	0.967635226371077914	6529.3749416028249	9121.3766617678921	6225.3703060664284	8470.1271098654943	3.1204325590220341	4.5204898724192724	0.69028637317841002	-0.2980	0.813362997361308795	8526.548960606784	10774.915267600543	7792.0224184343833	9943.1148933921304	3.0996992744192164	3.9451861049692121	0.78569152175481627	-0.1358	0.910145627165749436	9128.6360990250287	15853.368873331923	8258.3022297762163	14376.359224661464	3.6531916739672035	6.1934974862223582	0.58984308657488771	-0.5861	0.666146390077016157	1555.0070867744575	2035.6675668791115	1828.3611074043977	1792.6725440560845	0.79656613140278754	0.77572966301179669	1.0268604765094229	-0.0280	0.980763409541615458	1309.4976777501772	2468.9907961381855	1570.5588156244432	2198.0989311599515	0.63378099218240314	0.89312330337481971	0.70962317273276032	-0.4813	0.716346633943001919	1765.5487080363534	3762.3842558839337	2042.1256712933764	3420.6006867969113	0.79899648523109901	1.3850579865415134	0.57686861705060544	-0.4134	0.7508432357670955510	9902.9383781608431	9394.8901510500291	8838.8951248316316	8712.9258591056387	4.3037160842701994	4.309773273431647	0.99859454575051798	-0.0464	0.9683706383000958411	5112.95816610374	7540.3514795092078	5074.3601593900494	6988.8548890840611	2.292856151610549	3.054018710049681	0.75076689742128333	-0.3138	0.8045039392160662212	8298.2231580452062	13537.619872135305	7604.0002691062755	12376.825891639081	3.9349402465761867	6.4652865176762218	0.60862581044443775	-0.3034	0.8103476047555531213	1776.8625578959829	2641.8879136756623	2052.4472473571604	2360.7180953267557	0.95279413753472431	1.1290422641584199	0.84389589989789282	-0.1670	0.8907193052756150514	4122.4025153044677	4484.5430724898188	4238.6465308196875	4100.7738695133157	2.0310273085288575	2.0704131383640423	0.98097682578158973	-0.0053	0.9963406684507772915	954.23621114165007	1168.9967690485405	1183.293389684675	1031.89627559523	0.52433105581713613	0.47741210965783765	1.0982776624433037	0.1434	1.104500030752429816	1935.2594674188379	2919.3985637320202	2211.0486435582161	2627.5648788582503	0.94246887794390566	1.0914622002134295	0.8634919997775562	-0.2226	0.8570085657294205217	368.78211461321888	486.67813662964289	485.11686934720495	438.31787675141538	0.16725035569105631	0.14211012454621269	1.1769066857489685	0.1923	1.14255139375814218	3069.4768110809055	5525.1669563279156	3291.764523984446	5066.1551350832015	1.3772258474160768	2.1896272883176855	0.62897729433862426	-0.3943	0.7608376527082040319	826.09008943399317	1453.9117794398137	1038.3612683965214	1280.0972601755361	0.4200138791644164	0.53363736418329821	0.78707734381985028	-0.2151	0.8615017511620283220	1408.0652712996953	2398.7659328121654	1676.7263574191077	2126.5959137614832	0.65091650088238551	0.80826117631457062	0.80532941573461458	-0.1832	0.88073721250224957!sample_table_end
