Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415036/suppl/GSM415036_NN848.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415036/suppl/GSM415036_NN849.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16606!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3835.4444969976266	5503.9330974413397	3790.6355406897419	5312.5372820670873	1.1363153264523089	1.628204496320578	0.69789472331034474	-0.3575	0.780516315815259272	1560.959839424208	2767.1382674053293	1611.1602249386588	2855.9709407208666	0.4507596008507837	0.83056870455177578	0.54271199767157174	-0.9818	0.506330623566902843	3249.923671136663	4551.0678809089031	3231.334755996686	4482.524090541262	0.93696642900901228	1.3103889008478371	0.71502927749371492	-0.2860	0.820198717158324154	6282.8960004232731	13776.594829418762	6042.7298845538871	12353.197290149326	1.9935551682125947	4.0384295061617843	0.49364614763507803	-1.0255	0.491251306803356385	6964.1036877442139	11041.624323360757	6640.1002448835734	10006.106658447605	2.0029700413875897	3.1150260099183367	0.64300266996489708	-0.6926	0.618754464906361996	9784.1227234814269	10564.050408951078	9001.8274537552243	9558.2705654684814	2.8543006144812071	2.9828116629022143	0.95691613720727853	-0.0819	0.944796627639630137	2287.2570353168039	2771.7348736617491	2305.1943751813733	2856.6996143531042	0.74208600451913265	0.94278531124778175	0.78712088071989328	-0.3510	0.784051065628762488	2737.9101282535275	2942.6918157597779	2735.9005307339262	3026.0212584906735	0.8241788977269342	0.93467435445359248	0.88178186744916787	-0.1850	0.879643717163158819	4931.5207066100256	4128.8650921300332	4814.0078074975027	4116.2236844520858	1.5165405464189909	1.2908065589111146	1.1748782464339962	0.3488	1.27348793136911710	7676.5427007698963	8972.3602952643596	7249.609391880349	8223.9627864621052	2.3956094795836749	2.7315769616607857	0.87700603468523786	-0.2972	0.8138291226776306311	9634.5800183077972	13422.771871881479	8878.4795808244417	12170.720037079001	3.3291918044077606	4.2806641234778517	0.7777278731466879	-0.2795	0.8239000659503791212	7886.8079377650038	17947.63080908886	7431.0775997737965	16368.246296817482	2.6951751267782957	5.8882853025351469	0.45771816213081806	-0.9028	0.5348414168272557213	4466.772340137336	4838.4796795794764	4385.8926486170549	4737.8313969779756	1.3729006496048681	1.5402481438338378	0.8913503029372758	-0.0247	0.9830326248199715614	6041.4999088856266	9700.4143495034823	5829.0662104770281	8828.4130302611738	1.807403678331017	2.7020143805492802	0.66890971837226054	-0.6082	0.656003512177242415	3780.9804149308266	4464.1250219962376	3733.171780101165	4403.8196968232141	1.1526946879816875	1.4070276709676501	0.81924095152226017	-0.0831	0.9440481697574710816	3245.952077958917	4604.5410395058616	3225.1631226968188	4530.4053866342647	0.99314665942863545	1.3993870314960257	0.70970120279512972	-0.3112	0.8059455687137341317	1082.4982813055772	976.61528108013738	1152.5328838526218	1042.8533621483787	0.31868091539814847	0.29094542906632354	1.0953288265116636	0.2117	1.158042360721222718	3753.9247256049371	5190.6606076888102	3713.0822476937537	5040.5631182746547	1.1702245895796819	1.6320276881241407	0.71703721578691026	-0.3529	0.7830026095035839119	2634.2107838733714	2952.1574014545245	2636.4401755629115	3033.9181813757386	0.91225868425358803	1.0729005620837302	0.85027328393029056	-0.0164	0.9887174331807602220	1161.9602585128223	1901.7838191596995	1229.6022769063024	2007.1442636009797	0.46875935377873351	0.77276828820880372	0.60659755444321961	-0.5035	0.70537300728752261!sample_table_end
