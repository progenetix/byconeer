The CNV calls were generated after comparison with data of 360 normal samples included in the ChAS software. A detailed visual analysis has been performed for all alterations, excluding regions with poor data quality.!Sample_data_processing = The CYCHP files were generated using the standard analysis of ChAS 3.0 software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Rolando,Andre Rios,Villacis!Sample_contact_email = rolando.andre@unb.br!Sample_contact_phone = +5561996912223!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genetic Toxicology!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Morphology!Sample_contact_institute = University of BrasÃ­lia - UnB!Sample_contact_address = Asa Norte!Sample_contact_city = BrasÃ­lia!Sample_contact_state = DF!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 70910-900!Sample_contact_country = Brazil!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867938/suppl/GSM1867938_SL-41.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867938/suppl/GSM1867938_SL-41.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72667!Sample_series_id = GSE72668!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	-0.189566	-0.106230	2.111825C-4WYLN	0.144296	-0.025273	2.110866C-3BFNY	-0.117637	-0.254786	2.109309C-7ONNE	-0.398525	-0.175141	2.109394C-6HYCN	0.062571	-0.185072	2.108977C-7SCGC	-0.159075	-0.108115	2.108389C-7RZQQ	-0.319566	-0.320890	2.108126C-7RZWZ	-0.446130	-0.248124	2.106972C-7SEBI	-0.401267	0.026967	2.107461C-7RZIL	-0.019982	0.093888	2.107567C-4NQTX	-0.020528	-0.086326	2.107083C-7SDKW	0.449257	-0.027050	2.106593S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	0.388113	-0.029838	2.108198C-4LHKS	0.185507	0.019897	2.110019C-7RWHE	-0.806640	-0.112202	2.111586C-7SBEJ	0.036949	-0.073911	2.113543C-7RYJO	0.122407	0.423440	2.115377C-7SEGS	0.623779	0.448469	2.116737C-4LLXK	0.442636	0.378965	2.119278!sample_table_end
