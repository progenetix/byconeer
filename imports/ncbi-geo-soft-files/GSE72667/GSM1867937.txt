The CNV calls were generated after comparison with data of 360 normal samples included in the ChAS software. A detailed visual analysis has been performed for all alterations, excluding regions with poor data quality.!Sample_data_processing = The CYCHP files were generated using the standard analysis of ChAS 3.0 software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Rolando,Andre Rios,Villacis!Sample_contact_email = rolando.andre@unb.br!Sample_contact_phone = +5561996912223!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genetic Toxicology!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Morphology!Sample_contact_institute = University of BrasÃ­lia - UnB!Sample_contact_address = Asa Norte!Sample_contact_city = BrasÃ­lia!Sample_contact_state = DF!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 70910-900!Sample_contact_country = Brazil!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867937/suppl/GSM1867937_SL-38.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867937/suppl/GSM1867937_SL-38.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72667!Sample_series_id = GSE72668!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	-0.395699	-0.133224	2.096381C-4WYLN	0.123524	-0.009646	2.095621C-3BFNY	0.116835	-0.178579	2.093692C-7ONNE	-0.222487	-0.056379	2.093385C-6HYCN	-0.224059	-0.318445	2.093532C-7SCGC	-0.106566	-0.199037	2.093025C-7RZQQ	-0.343419	-0.363340	2.092847C-7RZWZ	-0.455009	-0.248230	2.092388C-7SEBI	-0.171703	-0.024247	2.092594C-7RZIL	0.003497	0.084966	2.093219C-4NQTX	-0.092401	-0.067802	2.094705C-7SDKW	0.287352	0.033826	2.095024S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	0.319454	-0.084532	2.096071C-4LHKS	0.196273	0.007774	2.097504C-7RWHE	-0.706262	-0.126004	2.098948C-7SBEJ	-0.056959	-0.044723	2.100437C-7RYJO	-0.247813	0.317512	2.102176C-7SEGS	0.375054	0.386168	2.103534C-4LLXK	0.554445	0.274535	2.104238!sample_table_end
