The CNV calls were generated after comparison with data of 360 normal samples included in the ChAS software. A detailed visual analysis has been performed for all alterations, excluding regions with poor data quality.!Sample_data_processing = The CYCHP files were generated using the standard analysis of ChAS 3.0 software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Rolando,Andre Rios,Villacis!Sample_contact_email = rolando.andre@unb.br!Sample_contact_phone = +5561996912223!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genetic Toxicology!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Morphology!Sample_contact_institute = University of BrasÃ­lia - UnB!Sample_contact_address = Asa Norte!Sample_contact_city = BrasÃ­lia!Sample_contact_state = DF!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 70910-900!Sample_contact_country = Brazil!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867935/suppl/GSM1867935_SL-36.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867935/suppl/GSM1867935_SL-36.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72667!Sample_series_id = GSE72668!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	-0.341527	-0.108104	1.888654C-4WYLN	0.226382	-0.016576	1.888140C-3BFNY	-0.197578	-0.236056	1.886968C-7ONNE	-0.192452	-0.144441	1.887325C-6HYCN	-0.144063	-0.222713	1.887326C-7SCGC	-0.243714	-0.130982	1.887053C-7RZQQ	-0.113421	-0.344049	1.886413C-7RZWZ	-0.448839	-0.252294	1.886553C-7SEBI	-0.001646	-0.135885	1.886773C-7RZIL	-0.206083	-0.044360	1.887197C-4NQTX	-0.104650	-0.241554	1.888484C-7SDKW	-0.260128	-0.150707	1.887737S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	0.057854	-0.183889	1.889053C-4LHKS	0.244116	-0.094369	1.890209C-7RWHE	-0.984181	-0.263863	1.891170C-7SBEJ	-0.036441	-0.176507	1.892675C-7RYJO	-0.137682	0.128340	1.893136C-7SEGS	0.166151	0.212536	1.894400C-4LLXK	0.238622	0.079306	1.895447!sample_table_end
