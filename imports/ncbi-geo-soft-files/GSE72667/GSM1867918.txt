The CNV calls were generated after comparison with data of 360 normal samples included in the ChAS software. A detailed visual analysis has been performed for all alterations, excluding regions with poor data quality.!Sample_data_processing = The CYCHP files were generated using the standard analysis of ChAS 3.0 software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Rolando,Andre Rios,Villacis!Sample_contact_email = rolando.andre@unb.br!Sample_contact_phone = +5561996912223!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genetic Toxicology!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Morphology!Sample_contact_institute = University of BrasÃ­lia - UnB!Sample_contact_address = Asa Norte!Sample_contact_city = BrasÃ­lia!Sample_contact_state = DF!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 70910-900!Sample_contact_country = Brazil!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867918/suppl/GSM1867918_SL-1.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867918/suppl/GSM1867918_SL-1.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72667!Sample_series_id = GSE72668!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	-0.012198	-0.036180	2.105834C-4WYLN	-0.054611	-0.064366	2.105905C-3BFNY	-0.115943	-0.097114	2.105611C-7ONNE	-0.139694	-0.124786	2.105717C-6HYCN	0.050953	-0.116630	2.105128C-7SCGC	-0.226272	-0.143350	2.104156C-7RZQQ	-0.109857	-0.175870	2.104497C-7RZWZ	-0.352008	-0.201334	2.104325C-7SEBI	-0.015274	0.121385	2.104546C-7RZIL	-0.100224	0.097295	2.103527C-4NQTX	0.094180	0.066219	2.102028C-7SDKW	0.349630	0.043409	2.102255S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	0.364836	0.178718	2.102669C-4LHKS	0.332742	0.156887	2.102924C-7RWHE	-0.090930	0.131303	2.103799C-7SBEJ	-0.029769	0.109971	2.104240C-7RYJO	-0.045433	0.190306	2.105178C-7SEGS	0.319144	0.168859	2.105840C-4LLXK	0.203470	0.156160	2.106714!sample_table_end
