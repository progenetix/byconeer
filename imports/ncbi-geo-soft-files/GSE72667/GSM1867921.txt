The CNV calls were generated after comparison with data of 360 normal samples included in the ChAS software. A detailed visual analysis has been performed for all alterations, excluding regions with poor data quality.!Sample_data_processing = The CYCHP files were generated using the standard analysis of ChAS 3.0 software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Rolando,Andre Rios,Villacis!Sample_contact_email = rolando.andre@unb.br!Sample_contact_phone = +5561996912223!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genetic Toxicology!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Morphology!Sample_contact_institute = University of BrasÃ­lia - UnB!Sample_contact_address = Asa Norte!Sample_contact_city = BrasÃ­lia!Sample_contact_state = DF!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 70910-900!Sample_contact_country = Brazil!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867921/suppl/GSM1867921_SL-6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867921/suppl/GSM1867921_SL-6.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72667!Sample_series_id = GSE72668!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	-0.026152	-0.047254	1.994785C-4WYLN	-0.016736	-0.000605	1.994377C-3BFNY	-0.064437	-0.036072	1.993373C-7ONNE	0.033678	0.010284	1.993349C-6HYCN	-0.066586	-0.203525	1.993353C-7SCGC	-0.228644	-0.157809	1.993323C-7RZQQ	-0.189247	-0.192109	1.993063C-7RZWZ	-0.216436	-0.147470	1.992934C-7SEBI	-0.101152	-0.061149	1.993071C-7RZIL	-0.212887	-0.018152	1.992695C-4NQTX	-0.122147	-0.050258	1.993426C-7SDKW	0.297032	-0.009601	1.993240S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	0.154197	0.015879	1.993849C-4LHKS	0.201446	0.053364	1.994906C-7RWHE	-0.238255	0.023968	1.995522C-7SBEJ	0.033176	0.057357	1.996332C-7RYJO	0.031766	0.170618	1.996825C-7SEGS	0.261909	0.198930	1.997305C-4LLXK	0.241507	0.170840	1.998654!sample_table_end
