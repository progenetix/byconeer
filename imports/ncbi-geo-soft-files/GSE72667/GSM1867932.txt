The CNV calls were generated after comparison with data of 360 normal samples included in the ChAS software. A detailed visual analysis has been performed for all alterations, excluding regions with poor data quality.!Sample_data_processing = The CYCHP files were generated using the standard analysis of ChAS 3.0 software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Rolando,Andre Rios,Villacis!Sample_contact_email = rolando.andre@unb.br!Sample_contact_phone = +5561996912223!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genetic Toxicology!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Morphology!Sample_contact_institute = University of BrasÃ­lia - UnB!Sample_contact_address = Asa Norte!Sample_contact_city = BrasÃ­lia!Sample_contact_state = DF!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 70910-900!Sample_contact_country = Brazil!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867932/suppl/GSM1867932_SL-29.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867932/suppl/GSM1867932_SL-29.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72667!Sample_series_id = GSE72668!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	-0.331983	-0.131115	2.029602C-4WYLN	0.109669	-0.084427	2.029611C-3BFNY	-0.049144	-0.216790	2.028812C-7ONNE	-0.330816	-0.169942	2.030288C-6HYCN	-0.054717	-0.307892	2.030153C-7SCGC	-0.370169	-0.260810	2.030279C-7RZQQ	-0.306361	-0.382568	2.030046C-7RZWZ	-0.555385	-0.335363	2.030249C-7SEBI	-0.285342	-0.021374	2.030763C-7RZIL	0.061462	0.025603	2.030871C-4NQTX	0.108863	-0.072347	2.032308C-7SDKW	0.020659	-0.026236	2.031307S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	0.286326	-0.076128	2.032547C-4LHKS	0.194143	-0.031800	2.033929C-7RWHE	-0.649258	-0.090392	2.035056C-7SBEJ	-0.078560	-0.049019	2.036651C-7RYJO	-0.117102	0.155085	2.038033C-7SEGS	0.227239	0.192128	2.039525C-4LLXK	0.249477	0.186077	2.041915!sample_table_end
