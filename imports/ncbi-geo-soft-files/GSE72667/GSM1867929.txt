The CNV calls were generated after comparison with data of 360 normal samples included in the ChAS software. A detailed visual analysis has been performed for all alterations, excluding regions with poor data quality.!Sample_data_processing = The CYCHP files were generated using the standard analysis of ChAS 3.0 software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Rolando,Andre Rios,Villacis!Sample_contact_email = rolando.andre@unb.br!Sample_contact_phone = +5561996912223!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genetic Toxicology!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Morphology!Sample_contact_institute = University of BrasÃ­lia - UnB!Sample_contact_address = Asa Norte!Sample_contact_city = BrasÃ­lia!Sample_contact_state = DF!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 70910-900!Sample_contact_country = Brazil!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867929/suppl/GSM1867929_SL-23.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867929/suppl/GSM1867929_SL-23.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72667!Sample_series_id = GSE72668!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	-0.312311	-0.071564	1.894190C-4WYLN	-0.082488	-0.051034	1.893729C-3BFNY	0.149503	-0.177339	1.892311C-7ONNE	-0.210836	-0.156196	1.892980C-6HYCN	0.105474	-0.175192	1.893451C-7SCGC	-0.330071	-0.152951	1.893326C-7RZQQ	-0.225856	-0.286406	1.892894C-7RZWZ	-0.426919	-0.262827	1.892990C-7SEBI	-0.131334	-0.069340	1.893124C-7RZIL	0.013044	-0.044511	1.892929C-4NQTX	-0.179299	-0.179799	1.894165C-7SDKW	-0.150228	-0.154167	1.893740S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	0.134592	-0.213323	1.894530C-4LHKS	0.273115	-0.187672	1.895796C-7RWHE	-1.108377	-0.306212	1.896613C-7SBEJ	-0.288154	-0.281598	1.896766C-7RYJO	-0.191643	0.083295	1.897284C-7SEGS	0.183525	0.105645	1.897626C-4LLXK	0.123636	0.023420	1.897906!sample_table_end
