The CNV calls were generated after comparison with data of 360 normal samples included in the ChAS software. A detailed visual analysis has been performed for all alterations, excluding regions with poor data quality.!Sample_data_processing = The CYCHP files were generated using the standard analysis of ChAS 3.0 software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Rolando,Andre Rios,Villacis!Sample_contact_email = rolando.andre@unb.br!Sample_contact_phone = +5561996912223!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genetic Toxicology!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Morphology!Sample_contact_institute = University of BrasÃ­lia - UnB!Sample_contact_address = Asa Norte!Sample_contact_city = BrasÃ­lia!Sample_contact_state = DF!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 70910-900!Sample_contact_country = Brazil!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867936/suppl/GSM1867936_SL-37.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867936/suppl/GSM1867936_SL-37.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72667!Sample_series_id = GSE72668!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.089424	0.007818	2.128673C-4WYLN	0.091127	0.100324	2.128054C-3BFNY	-0.062522	-0.038330	2.126842C-7ONNE	0.005042	0.053258	2.127734C-6HYCN	0.026859	-0.151921	2.128311C-7SCGC	0.002236	-0.062227	2.128526C-7RZQQ	-0.223173	-0.182114	2.128699C-7RZWZ	-0.297569	-0.095384	2.129435C-7SEBI	-0.361136	-0.028914	2.129943C-7RZIL	0.027921	0.053667	2.128300C-4NQTX	0.165033	-0.033251	2.126918C-7SDKW	0.203574	0.043895	2.127551S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	0.278023	-0.003620	2.127949C-4LHKS	0.133069	0.066752	2.128247C-7RWHE	-0.439127	0.019708	2.129218C-7SBEJ	0.192863	0.081996	2.130584C-7RYJO	-0.444137	0.117261	2.131555C-7SEGS	0.371609	0.170273	2.132390C-4LLXK	0.334270	0.162505	2.133486!sample_table_end
