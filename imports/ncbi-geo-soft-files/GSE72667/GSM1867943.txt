The CNV calls were generated after comparison with data of 360 normal samples included in the ChAS software. A detailed visual analysis has been performed for all alterations, excluding regions with poor data quality.!Sample_data_processing = The CYCHP files were generated using the standard analysis of ChAS 3.0 software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Rolando,Andre Rios,Villacis!Sample_contact_email = rolando.andre@unb.br!Sample_contact_phone = +5561996912223!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genetic Toxicology!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Morphology!Sample_contact_institute = University of BrasÃ­lia - UnB!Sample_contact_address = Asa Norte!Sample_contact_city = BrasÃ­lia!Sample_contact_state = DF!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 70910-900!Sample_contact_country = Brazil!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867943/suppl/GSM1867943_SL-54.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867943/suppl/GSM1867943_SL-54.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72667!Sample_series_id = GSE72668!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	-0.510973	-0.198172	1.811339C-4WYLN	0.059418	-0.100951	1.811569C-3BFNY	-0.086899	-0.263335	1.810866C-7ONNE	-0.191004	-0.166996	1.810382C-6HYCN	0.012212	-0.181203	1.810057C-7SCGC	-0.185143	-0.086643	1.809525C-7RZQQ	-0.201207	-0.254140	1.808915C-7RZWZ	-0.310150	-0.162303	1.808326C-7SEBI	-0.338681	-0.228561	1.809085C-7RZIL	-0.282949	-0.140437	1.807478C-4NQTX	-0.296905	-0.312270	1.805986C-7SDKW	0.008378	-0.228891	1.805763S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	0.445362	-0.004361	1.806284C-4LHKS	0.241935	0.073226	1.807102C-7RWHE	-0.736717	-0.094958	1.807933C-7SBEJ	-0.000860	-0.024175	1.808481C-7RYJO	-0.114759	0.171081	1.808808C-7SEGS	0.285615	0.234125	1.809725C-4LLXK	0.138160	0.080164	1.811043!sample_table_end
