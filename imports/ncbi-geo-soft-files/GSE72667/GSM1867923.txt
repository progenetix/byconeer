The CNV calls were generated after comparison with data of 360 normal samples included in the ChAS software. A detailed visual analysis has been performed for all alterations, excluding regions with poor data quality.!Sample_data_processing = The CYCHP files were generated using the standard analysis of ChAS 3.0 software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Rolando,Andre Rios,Villacis!Sample_contact_email = rolando.andre@unb.br!Sample_contact_phone = +5561996912223!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genetic Toxicology!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Morphology!Sample_contact_institute = University of BrasÃ­lia - UnB!Sample_contact_address = Asa Norte!Sample_contact_city = BrasÃ­lia!Sample_contact_state = DF!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 70910-900!Sample_contact_country = Brazil!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867923/suppl/GSM1867923_SL-11.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867923/suppl/GSM1867923_SL-11.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72667!Sample_series_id = GSE72668!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	-0.283568	-0.056325	1.965303C-4WYLN	0.128410	-0.010243	1.964325C-3BFNY	0.147623	-0.009137	1.962880C-7ONNE	-0.031795	0.036375	1.962357C-6HYCN	-0.160962	-0.157354	1.963013C-7SCGC	-0.146081	-0.112986	1.963018C-7RZQQ	0.025249	-0.120366	1.963145C-7RZWZ	-0.186654	-0.077743	1.963808C-7SEBI	-0.204109	-0.189403	1.964318C-7RZIL	-0.222468	-0.149144	1.965017C-4NQTX	-0.242926	-0.168867	1.965759C-7SDKW	0.030478	-0.131612	1.966156S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	0.026835	-0.107048	1.966828C-4LHKS	0.033893	-0.073446	1.967856C-7RWHE	-0.362266	-0.102748	1.968796C-7SBEJ	-0.055134	-0.073426	1.969823C-7RYJO	0.062660	-0.107326	1.970592C-7SEGS	-0.187008	-0.082866	1.971549C-4LLXK	-0.276679	-0.114780	1.972872!sample_table_end
