The CNV calls were generated after comparison with data of 360 normal samples included in the ChAS software. A detailed visual analysis has been performed for all alterations, excluding regions with poor data quality.!Sample_data_processing = The CYCHP files were generated using the standard analysis of ChAS 3.0 software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Rolando,Andre Rios,Villacis!Sample_contact_email = rolando.andre@unb.br!Sample_contact_phone = +5561996912223!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genetic Toxicology!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Morphology!Sample_contact_institute = University of BrasÃ­lia - UnB!Sample_contact_address = Asa Norte!Sample_contact_city = BrasÃ­lia!Sample_contact_state = DF!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 70910-900!Sample_contact_country = Brazil!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867931/suppl/GSM1867931_SL-26.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867931/suppl/GSM1867931_SL-26.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72667!Sample_series_id = GSE72668!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.020915	0.119552	2.219712C-4WYLN	0.076150	0.144747	2.220863C-3BFNY	-0.011863	-0.137522	2.219816C-7ONNE	-0.071614	-0.113189	2.219287C-6HYCN	0.257022	0.152483	2.219446C-7SCGC	0.063767	0.175075	2.218790C-7RZQQ	-0.053014	-0.120952	2.219544C-7RZWZ	-0.162173	-0.101005	2.219486C-7SEBI	-0.176787	0.063295	2.220288C-7RZIL	-0.006073	0.079673	2.217599C-4NQTX	-0.315821	-0.233790	2.215502C-7SDKW	0.185953	-0.221913	2.215526S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	0.337702	-0.014328	2.216048C-4LHKS	0.351695	-0.007860	2.216537C-7RWHE	-1.108799	-0.327216	2.217091C-7SBEJ	-0.257013	-0.326985	2.217397C-7RYJO	1.242928	0.768996	2.218337C-7SEGS	0.413485	0.762272	2.219259C-4LLXK	0.319811	0.460037	2.220592!sample_table_end
