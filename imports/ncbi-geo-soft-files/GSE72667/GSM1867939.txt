The CNV calls were generated after comparison with data of 360 normal samples included in the ChAS software. A detailed visual analysis has been performed for all alterations, excluding regions with poor data quality.!Sample_data_processing = The CYCHP files were generated using the standard analysis of ChAS 3.0 software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Rolando,Andre Rios,Villacis!Sample_contact_email = rolando.andre@unb.br!Sample_contact_phone = +5561996912223!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genetic Toxicology!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Morphology!Sample_contact_institute = University of BrasÃ­lia - UnB!Sample_contact_address = Asa Norte!Sample_contact_city = BrasÃ­lia!Sample_contact_state = DF!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 70910-900!Sample_contact_country = Brazil!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867939/suppl/GSM1867939_SL-43.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867939/suppl/GSM1867939_SL-43.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72667!Sample_series_id = GSE72668!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	-0.297387	-0.083149	2.053664C-4WYLN	0.028750	-0.030454	2.053159C-3BFNY	0.071515	-0.099562	2.052347C-7ONNE	-0.063426	-0.047381	2.052172C-6HYCN	-0.066634	-0.200378	2.052177C-7SCGC	-0.276692	-0.149255	2.052432C-7RZQQ	-0.155057	-0.221628	2.052154C-7RZWZ	-0.245039	-0.172162	2.052205C-7SEBI	-0.173566	-0.169238	2.052480C-7RZIL	-0.041866	-0.122094	2.053604C-4NQTX	-0.268441	-0.194129	2.055029C-7SDKW	-0.151620	-0.150032	2.054688S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	0.154242	-0.004270	2.055186C-4LHKS	0.250634	0.036022	2.055733C-7RWHE	-0.416055	-0.024584	2.056741C-7SBEJ	0.029496	0.011159	2.057758C-7RYJO	-0.039992	0.215128	2.059012C-7SEGS	0.302954	0.245639	2.060040C-4LLXK	0.366437	0.208729	2.061345!sample_table_end
