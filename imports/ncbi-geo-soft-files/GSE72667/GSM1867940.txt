The CNV calls were generated after comparison with data of 360 normal samples included in the ChAS software. A detailed visual analysis has been performed for all alterations, excluding regions with poor data quality.!Sample_data_processing = The CYCHP files were generated using the standard analysis of ChAS 3.0 software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Rolando,Andre Rios,Villacis!Sample_contact_email = rolando.andre@unb.br!Sample_contact_phone = +5561996912223!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genetic Toxicology!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Morphology!Sample_contact_institute = University of BrasÃ­lia - UnB!Sample_contact_address = Asa Norte!Sample_contact_city = BrasÃ­lia!Sample_contact_state = DF!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 70910-900!Sample_contact_country = Brazil!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867940/suppl/GSM1867940_SL-48.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867940/suppl/GSM1867940_SL-48.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72667!Sample_series_id = GSE72668!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	-0.438250	-0.225119	1.963858C-4WYLN	-0.082991	-0.144816	1.963601C-3BFNY	0.055447	-0.203169	1.962283C-7ONNE	-0.230336	-0.123027	1.962814C-6HYCN	-0.032182	-0.160232	1.963569C-7SCGC	-0.182587	-0.080464	1.963644C-7RZQQ	-0.144284	-0.154580	1.963269C-7RZWZ	-0.111735	-0.075513	1.963041C-7SEBI	-0.146090	-0.115574	1.963762C-7RZIL	-0.242587	-0.037680	1.964668C-4NQTX	-0.159841	-0.137325	1.965802C-7SDKW	0.196710	-0.061231	1.965383S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	-0.020136	-0.111026	1.966340C-4LHKS	0.334163	-0.037505	1.967679C-7RWHE	-0.579390	-0.163786	1.968787C-7SBEJ	-0.140679	-0.093723	1.969779C-7RYJO	0.097838	0.292341	1.970883C-7SEGS	0.344786	0.357999	1.971949C-4LLXK	0.337309	0.210785	1.972522!sample_table_end
