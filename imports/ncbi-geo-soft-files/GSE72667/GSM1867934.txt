The CNV calls were generated after comparison with data of 360 normal samples included in the ChAS software. A detailed visual analysis has been performed for all alterations, excluding regions with poor data quality.!Sample_data_processing = The CYCHP files were generated using the standard analysis of ChAS 3.0 software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Rolando,Andre Rios,Villacis!Sample_contact_email = rolando.andre@unb.br!Sample_contact_phone = +5561996912223!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genetic Toxicology!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Morphology!Sample_contact_institute = University of BrasÃ­lia - UnB!Sample_contact_address = Asa Norte!Sample_contact_city = BrasÃ­lia!Sample_contact_state = DF!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 70910-900!Sample_contact_country = Brazil!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867934/suppl/GSM1867934_SL-35.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867934/suppl/GSM1867934_SL-35.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72667!Sample_series_id = GSE72668!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	-0.125982	0.092435	2.212829C-4WYLN	0.203363	0.159513	2.212842C-3BFNY	0.175120	0.006248	2.211415C-7ONNE	0.077679	0.071986	2.211154C-6HYCN	0.048070	-0.042405	2.211433C-7SCGC	0.090240	0.020657	2.211637C-7RZQQ	-0.087893	-0.137651	2.211389C-7RZWZ	-0.288420	-0.078600	2.211276C-7SEBI	-0.131050	0.054227	2.212386C-7RZIL	-0.001444	0.107959	2.210510C-4NQTX	-0.007460	-0.056226	2.208970C-7SDKW	0.236844	-0.009072	2.209043S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	0.281093	0.062715	2.209432C-4LHKS	0.412196	0.102129	2.210282C-7RWHE	-0.406375	-0.063682	2.210662C-7SBEJ	-0.218768	-0.033015	2.211201C-7RYJO	-0.022643	0.410626	2.211809C-7SEGS	0.553693	0.431753	2.212151C-4LLXK	0.485418	0.271289	2.213465!sample_table_end
