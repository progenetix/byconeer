The CNV calls were generated after comparison with data of 360 normal samples included in the ChAS software. A detailed visual analysis has been performed for all alterations, excluding regions with poor data quality.!Sample_data_processing = The CYCHP files were generated using the standard analysis of ChAS 3.0 software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Rolando,Andre Rios,Villacis!Sample_contact_email = rolando.andre@unb.br!Sample_contact_phone = +5561996912223!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genetic Toxicology!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Morphology!Sample_contact_institute = University of BrasÃ­lia - UnB!Sample_contact_address = Asa Norte!Sample_contact_city = BrasÃ­lia!Sample_contact_state = DF!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 70910-900!Sample_contact_country = Brazil!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867930/suppl/GSM1867930_SL-25.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867930/suppl/GSM1867930_SL-25.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72667!Sample_series_id = GSE72668!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	-0.118709	-0.026625	1.839939C-4WYLN	-0.005061	0.004944	1.840166C-3BFNY	-0.055851	-0.209376	1.839589C-7ONNE	-0.229602	-0.178167	1.839515C-6HYCN	0.264450	-0.032621	1.839459C-7SCGC	-0.087750	-0.002202	1.839279C-7RZQQ	-0.279285	-0.217883	1.839634C-7RZWZ	-0.338934	-0.188818	1.839642C-7SEBI	-0.403194	-0.114464	1.840344C-7RZIL	-0.178872	-0.087487	1.838906C-4NQTX	-0.182018	-0.303340	1.837057C-7SDKW	-0.020557	-0.279349	1.837912S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	0.096859	-0.130737	1.838572C-4LHKS	0.132572	-0.110755	1.839474C-7RWHE	-0.886074	-0.322361	1.840291C-7SBEJ	-0.214687	-0.307460	1.841627C-7RYJO	0.110309	0.330592	1.842199C-7SEGS	0.405234	0.339374	1.843305C-4LLXK	0.085610	0.138147	1.844877!sample_table_end
