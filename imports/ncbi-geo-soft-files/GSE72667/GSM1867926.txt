The CNV calls were generated after comparison with data of 360 normal samples included in the ChAS software. A detailed visual analysis has been performed for all alterations, excluding regions with poor data quality.!Sample_data_processing = The CYCHP files were generated using the standard analysis of ChAS 3.0 software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Rolando,Andre Rios,Villacis!Sample_contact_email = rolando.andre@unb.br!Sample_contact_phone = +5561996912223!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genetic Toxicology!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Morphology!Sample_contact_institute = University of BrasÃ­lia - UnB!Sample_contact_address = Asa Norte!Sample_contact_city = BrasÃ­lia!Sample_contact_state = DF!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 70910-900!Sample_contact_country = Brazil!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867926/suppl/GSM1867926_SL-14.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867926/suppl/GSM1867926_SL-14.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72667!Sample_series_id = GSE72668!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	-0.313055	-0.081408	2.094070C-4WYLN	0.119171	-0.054331	2.093745C-3BFNY	-0.048436	-0.267892	2.092706C-7ONNE	-0.403919	-0.242609	2.093404C-6HYCN	0.132494	0.006174	2.093362C-7SCGC	0.098904	0.027877	2.092646C-7RZQQ	-0.297835	-0.172391	2.091637C-7RZWZ	-0.227960	-0.156058	2.090880C-7SEBI	-0.134531	-0.088735	2.091612C-7RZIL	-0.299354	-0.079538	2.091638C-4NQTX	-0.298501	-0.251611	2.091368C-7SDKW	0.061253	-0.251251	2.091654S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	0.161154	-0.035428	2.092907C-4LHKS	0.253632	-0.045495	2.094188C-7RWHE	-0.484857	-0.173276	2.094886C-7SBEJ	-0.379290	-0.195162	2.096084C-7RYJO	0.005332	0.281595	2.097180C-7SEGS	0.210574	0.246768	2.098653C-4LLXK	0.068168	0.177380	2.100189!sample_table_end
