The CNV calls were generated after comparison with data of 360 normal samples included in the ChAS software. A detailed visual analysis has been performed for all alterations, excluding regions with poor data quality.!Sample_data_processing = The CYCHP files were generated using the standard analysis of ChAS 3.0 software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Rolando,Andre Rios,Villacis!Sample_contact_email = rolando.andre@unb.br!Sample_contact_phone = +5561996912223!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genetic Toxicology!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Morphology!Sample_contact_institute = University of BrasÃ­lia - UnB!Sample_contact_address = Asa Norte!Sample_contact_city = BrasÃ­lia!Sample_contact_state = DF!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 70910-900!Sample_contact_country = Brazil!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867928/suppl/GSM1867928_SL-20.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867928/suppl/GSM1867928_SL-20.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72667!Sample_series_id = GSE72668!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	-0.339231	-0.123265	2.027875C-4WYLN	0.089913	0.011582	2.026838C-3BFNY	-0.163489	-0.190379	2.025357C-7ONNE	0.052970	-0.057774	2.025359C-6HYCN	0.089997	-0.185875	2.025655C-7SCGC	-0.110670	-0.057754	2.024804C-7RZQQ	-0.264203	-0.253730	2.024372C-7RZWZ	-0.344802	-0.132322	2.023819C-7SEBI	-0.258162	-0.084606	2.024442C-7RZIL	-0.176881	0.027890	2.024137C-4NQTX	-0.093915	-0.152077	2.024350C-7SDKW	0.269557	-0.050611	2.024384S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	-0.026013	-0.211991	2.025788C-4LHKS	0.246936	-0.123527	2.027008C-7RWHE	-0.869413	-0.272546	2.028601C-7SBEJ	-0.158407	-0.198819	2.030024C-7RYJO	0.092571	0.336238	2.031306C-7SEGS	0.520396	0.393817	2.032282C-4LLXK	0.397604	0.291841	2.033273!sample_table_end
