The CNV calls were generated after comparison with data of 360 normal samples included in the ChAS software. A detailed visual analysis has been performed for all alterations, excluding regions with poor data quality.!Sample_data_processing = The CYCHP files were generated using the standard analysis of ChAS 3.0 software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Rolando,Andre Rios,Villacis!Sample_contact_email = rolando.andre@unb.br!Sample_contact_phone = +5561996912223!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genetic Toxicology!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Morphology!Sample_contact_institute = University of BrasÃ­lia - UnB!Sample_contact_address = Asa Norte!Sample_contact_city = BrasÃ­lia!Sample_contact_state = DF!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 70910-900!Sample_contact_country = Brazil!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867925/suppl/GSM1867925_SL-13.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867925/suppl/GSM1867925_SL-13.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72667!Sample_series_id = GSE72668!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.915947	0.414900	2.124851C-4WYLN	0.101675	0.330898	2.124281C-3BFNY	-0.216583	0.047141	2.123924C-7ONNE	-0.043941	-0.035849	2.123879C-6HYCN	0.634609	0.383163	2.123880C-7SCGC	0.296943	0.302093	2.123589C-7RZQQ	-0.019968	0.039792	2.123107C-7RZWZ	-0.225157	-0.038623	2.122678C-7SEBI	-0.494362	0.038255	2.124251C-7RZIL	0.009619	-0.037004	2.123183C-4NQTX	0.003622	-0.267357	2.121883C-7SDKW	-0.124216	-0.339216	2.121642S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	-0.230724	-0.159632	2.120836C-4LHKS	-0.090647	-0.228072	2.120847C-7RWHE	-0.362016	-0.429539	2.121198C-7SBEJ	-0.628587	-0.494731	2.121373C-7RYJO	-0.076018	0.344917	2.122112C-7SEGS	0.563985	0.282701	2.122574C-4LLXK	0.198012	0.100180	2.123673!sample_table_end
