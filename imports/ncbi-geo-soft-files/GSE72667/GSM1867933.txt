The CNV calls were generated after comparison with data of 360 normal samples included in the ChAS software. A detailed visual analysis has been performed for all alterations, excluding regions with poor data quality.!Sample_data_processing = The CYCHP files were generated using the standard analysis of ChAS 3.0 software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Rolando,Andre Rios,Villacis!Sample_contact_email = rolando.andre@unb.br!Sample_contact_phone = +5561996912223!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genetic Toxicology!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Morphology!Sample_contact_institute = University of BrasÃ­lia - UnB!Sample_contact_address = Asa Norte!Sample_contact_city = BrasÃ­lia!Sample_contact_state = DF!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 70910-900!Sample_contact_country = Brazil!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867933/suppl/GSM1867933_SL-34.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867933/suppl/GSM1867933_SL-34.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72667!Sample_series_id = GSE72668!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	-0.185336	-0.038371	2.023520C-4WYLN	-0.031161	0.026443	2.025385C-3BFNY	0.135183	-0.122862	2.024421C-7ONNE	-0.111377	-0.057904	2.024700C-6HYCN	0.101242	-0.021150	2.024814C-7SCGC	0.101918	0.044012	2.025059C-7RZQQ	-0.083731	-0.113164	2.024232C-7RZWZ	-0.257641	-0.047908	2.024276C-7SEBI	-0.088999	-0.020161	2.024114C-7RZIL	-0.165890	0.044875	2.021677C-4NQTX	-0.020025	-0.119435	2.019885C-7SDKW	0.125040	-0.055153	2.019032S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	0.146999	-0.141801	2.018986C-4LHKS	0.265298	-0.078984	2.019660C-7RWHE	-0.968406	-0.238081	2.020243C-7SBEJ	-0.080325	-0.177547	2.020676C-7RYJO	0.135045	0.351024	2.020718C-7SEGS	0.456464	0.408448	2.020955C-4LLXK	0.213247	0.274534	2.021541!sample_table_end
