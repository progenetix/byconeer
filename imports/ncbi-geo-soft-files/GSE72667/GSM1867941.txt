The CNV calls were generated after comparison with data of 360 normal samples included in the ChAS software. A detailed visual analysis has been performed for all alterations, excluding regions with poor data quality.!Sample_data_processing = The CYCHP files were generated using the standard analysis of ChAS 3.0 software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Rolando,Andre Rios,Villacis!Sample_contact_email = rolando.andre@unb.br!Sample_contact_phone = +5561996912223!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genetic Toxicology!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Morphology!Sample_contact_institute = University of BrasÃ­lia - UnB!Sample_contact_address = Asa Norte!Sample_contact_city = BrasÃ­lia!Sample_contact_state = DF!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 70910-900!Sample_contact_country = Brazil!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867941/suppl/GSM1867941_SL-51.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867941/suppl/GSM1867941_SL-51.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72667!Sample_series_id = GSE72668!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	-0.322933	-0.094396	2.074753C-4WYLN	0.083830	-0.019116	2.074397C-3BFNY	0.055725	-0.123584	2.073419C-7ONNE	-0.103917	-0.050197	2.073243C-6HYCN	0.105859	-0.100933	2.073429C-7SCGC	-0.144505	-0.031348	2.073175C-7RZQQ	-0.261701	-0.132926	2.072409C-7RZWZ	-0.033938	-0.069080	2.071798C-7SEBI	-0.217077	-0.112472	2.071964C-7RZIL	-0.232323	-0.056327	2.073642C-4NQTX	-0.137965	-0.145519	2.074474C-7SDKW	0.174044	-0.099006	2.073949S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	0.356707	-0.083236	2.074713C-4LHKS	0.211217	-0.048199	2.075464C-7RWHE	-0.859249	-0.107242	2.075989C-7SBEJ	-0.032702	-0.085332	2.076287C-7RYJO	0.097681	0.314976	2.076629C-7SEGS	0.385817	0.322402	2.077598C-4LLXK	0.366396	0.313543	2.078954!sample_table_end
