The CNV calls were generated after comparison with data of 360 normal samples included in the ChAS software. A detailed visual analysis has been performed for all alterations, excluding regions with poor data quality.!Sample_data_processing = The CYCHP files were generated using the standard analysis of ChAS 3.0 software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Rolando,Andre Rios,Villacis!Sample_contact_email = rolando.andre@unb.br!Sample_contact_phone = +5561996912223!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genetic Toxicology!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Morphology!Sample_contact_institute = University of BrasÃ­lia - UnB!Sample_contact_address = Asa Norte!Sample_contact_city = BrasÃ­lia!Sample_contact_state = DF!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 70910-900!Sample_contact_country = Brazil!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867927/suppl/GSM1867927_SL-18.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867927/suppl/GSM1867927_SL-18.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72667!Sample_series_id = GSE72668!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	-0.218572	-0.104306	2.027444C-4WYLN	-0.051499	0.061330	2.026202C-3BFNY	-0.044340	-0.191985	2.024524C-7ONNE	0.053294	-0.026156	2.024075C-6HYCN	0.115834	-0.039491	2.023793C-7SCGC	0.145085	0.126596	2.023496C-7RZQQ	-0.000334	-0.141022	2.022943C-7RZWZ	-0.289367	0.025140	2.022969C-7SEBI	-0.237336	-0.104531	2.023275C-7RZIL	-0.203820	0.061204	2.023349C-4NQTX	0.005029	-0.226152	2.023962C-7SDKW	0.104933	-0.061716	2.023707S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	0.157543	-0.175419	2.024192C-4LHKS	0.475338	-0.013511	2.024879C-7RWHE	-1.221649	-0.314184	2.025212C-7SBEJ	-0.070704	-0.156332	2.025822C-7RYJO	-0.207801	0.270068	2.026361C-7SEGS	0.504642	0.422120	2.026680C-4LLXK	0.322168	0.122215	2.026353!sample_table_end
