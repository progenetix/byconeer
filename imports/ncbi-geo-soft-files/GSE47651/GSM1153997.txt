Non-adherent cells were removed after approximately 24 h by replacement of the medium. Subsequently, the adherent cells were allowed to expand until 70% confluence (5â6 days) before they were harvested and further expanded.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = DNA was isolated using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, USA).!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Standard Affymetrix label protocol!Sample_hyb_protocol = Standard Affymetrix hyb protocol!Sample_scan_protocol = Standard Affymetrix scan protocol!Sample_data_processing = Quality control was performed using the Genotyping Console v3.0.1 software (Affymetrix), applying the contrast quality control (CQC) algorithm with a minimal call rate of > 86 %. DNA copy number analysis was performed using the Nexus software (BioDiscovery, California, USA), with the SNPRank segmentation algorithm using default settings (threshold of 0.6 for high copy gain, 0.2 for gain, -0.2 for loss and -1.0 for homozygous loss).!Sample_data_processing = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_data_processing = Copy number probes and segments, as well as SNP calls and segments obtained from NEXUS copy number.
