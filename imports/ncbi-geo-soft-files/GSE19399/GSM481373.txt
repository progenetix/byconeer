The majority of tumors were obtained at primary surgery, with the exceptions of 27 prostate tumors obtained through rapid autopsy programs at the Universities of Washington and Michigan!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Each sample was genotyped using the Sty I chip of the 500K Human Mapping Array wet (Affymetrix), containing probes to 238,270 SNP loci, according to manufacturerâs instructions. In brief, 250 ng of genomic DNA was digested with the StyI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs), ligated to an adaptor with T4 ligase (New England Biolabs), and PCR-amplified using a 9700 Thermal Cycler I (Applied Biosystems) and Titanium Taq (Clontech) to achieve fragments ranging from 200-1100 bp. These fragments were pooled, concentrated, processed through a clean-up step, and further fragmented with DNaseI (Affymetrix) before being labeled, denatured, and hybridized to arrays!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were washed and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix)!Sample_description = Hybridized to 250K_Sty!Sample_data_processing = Probe-level signal intensities were normalized to a common reference array using quantile normalization and combined to form SNP-level signal intensities using the dChip model-based expression (PM/MM) method . Genome-wide copy number estimates were obtained using tangent normalization, in which tumor signal intensities are divided by signal intensities from the linear combination of all normal samples that is most similar to the tumor (as described in Beroukhim et al, In Press; and Getz et al., In Preparation). Cancer samples were normalized against a pool of 1,480 reference samples derived from multiple studies; the code and reference data necessary to replicate this analysis are available for download in GEO. Genotype Call (SNP call) are provided in .CHP.TXT files: AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Craig,,Mermel!Sample_contact_email = cmermel@broadinstitute.org!Sample_contact_phone = 617-714-7563!Sample_contact_laboratory = Matthew Meyerson Lab!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Program!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02142!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481373/suppl/GSM481373_UNLET_p_Sty18_Mapping250K_Sty_F03_79352.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481373/suppl/GSM481373_UNLET_p_Sty18_Mapping250K_Sty_F03_79352.CHP.TXT.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19399!Sample_data_row_count = 238230#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number via tangent normalization!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1909444	1.528576SNP_A-2237149	1.523417SNP_A-4303947	1.518311SNP_A-2236359	1.858446SNP_A-2205441	1.532535SNP_A-2116190	1.741012SNP_A-4291020	1.834709SNP_A-2109914	1.878038SNP_A-2291997	1.863121SNP_A-4277872	1.581080SNP_A-2118217	1.976693SNP_A-1866065	2.046469SNP_A-2288244	2.060097SNP_A-1783407	1.627355SNP_A-2169457	1.598160SNP_A-4271011	2.058127SNP_A-2082515	1.902054SNP_A-1910751	1.674342SNP_A-2081399	1.302725SNP_A-2223642	1.658242!sample_table_end
