The majority of tumors were obtained at primary surgery, with the exceptions of 27 prostate tumors obtained through rapid autopsy programs at the Universities of Washington and Michigan!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Each sample was genotyped using the Sty I chip of the 500K Human Mapping Array wet (Affymetrix), containing probes to 238,270 SNP loci, according to manufacturerâs instructions. In brief, 250 ng of genomic DNA was digested with the StyI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs), ligated to an adaptor with T4 ligase (New England Biolabs), and PCR-amplified using a 9700 Thermal Cycler I (Applied Biosystems) and Titanium Taq (Clontech) to achieve fragments ranging from 200-1100 bp. These fragments were pooled, concentrated, processed through a clean-up step, and further fragmented with DNaseI (Affymetrix) before being labeled, denatured, and hybridized to arrays!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were washed and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix)!Sample_description = Hybridized to 250K_Sty!Sample_data_processing = Probe-level signal intensities were normalized to a common reference array using quantile normalization and combined to form SNP-level signal intensities using the dChip model-based expression (PM/MM) method . Genome-wide copy number estimates were obtained using tangent normalization, in which tumor signal intensities are divided by signal intensities from the linear combination of all normal samples that is most similar to the tumor (as described in Beroukhim et al, In Press; and Getz et al., In Preparation).  Cancer samples were normalized against a pool of 1,480 reference samples derived from multiple studies; the code and reference data necessary to replicate this analysis are available for download in GEO (accession GSE17958). The attached data matrix files contains the normalized copy-number values produced by that algorithm.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype Call (SNP call) are provided in .CHP.TXT files: AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall.  Normalized copy number data for samples can be found in tumor-type matrix files: 'Signal' = Normalized copy number.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Craig,,Mermel!Sample_contact_email = cmermel@broadinstitute.org!Sample_contact_phone = 617-714-7563!Sample_contact_laboratory = Matthew Meyerson Lab!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Program!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02142!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM482nnn/GSM482681/suppl/GSM482681_VINOS_p_Sty8_Mapping250K_Sty_C07_54134.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM482nnn/GSM482681/suppl/GSM482681_VINOS_p_Sty8_Mapping250K_Sty_C07_54134.CHP.TXT.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19399!Sample_data_row_count = 238230#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number via tangent normalization!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1909444	2.373232SNP_A-2237149	2.382477SNP_A-4303947	2.269166SNP_A-2236359	2.690563SNP_A-2205441	2.435170SNP_A-2116190	1.921182SNP_A-4291020	1.814544SNP_A-2109914	1.941117SNP_A-2291997	1.993977SNP_A-4277872	1.675992SNP_A-2118217	2.062278SNP_A-1866065	1.783142SNP_A-2288244	1.718096SNP_A-1783407	2.310812SNP_A-2169457	2.209821SNP_A-4271011	2.066476SNP_A-2082515	1.853503SNP_A-1910751	1.853904SNP_A-2081399	2.624628SNP_A-2223642	2.110456!sample_table_end
