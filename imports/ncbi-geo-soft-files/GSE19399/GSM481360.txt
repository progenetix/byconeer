The majority of tumors were obtained at primary surgery, with the exceptions of 27 prostate tumors obtained through rapid autopsy programs at the Universities of Washington and Michigan!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Each sample was genotyped using the Sty I chip of the 500K Human Mapping Array wet (Affymetrix), containing probes to 238,270 SNP loci, according to manufacturerâs instructions. In brief, 250 ng of genomic DNA was digested with the StyI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs), ligated to an adaptor with T4 ligase (New England Biolabs), and PCR-amplified using a 9700 Thermal Cycler I (Applied Biosystems) and Titanium Taq (Clontech) to achieve fragments ranging from 200-1100 bp. These fragments were pooled, concentrated, processed through a clean-up step, and further fragmented with DNaseI (Affymetrix) before being labeled, denatured, and hybridized to arrays!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were washed and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix)!Sample_description = Hybridized to 250K_Sty!Sample_data_processing = Probe-level signal intensities were normalized to a common reference array using quantile normalization and combined to form SNP-level signal intensities using the dChip model-based expression (PM/MM) method . Genome-wide copy number estimates were obtained using tangent normalization, in which tumor signal intensities are divided by signal intensities from the linear combination of all normal samples that is most similar to the tumor (as described in Beroukhim et al, In Press; and Getz et al., In Preparation). Cancer samples were normalized against a pool of 1,480 reference samples derived from multiple studies; the code and reference data necessary to replicate this analysis are available for download in GEO. Genotype Call (SNP call) are provided in .CHP.TXT files: AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Craig,,Mermel!Sample_contact_email = cmermel@broadinstitute.org!Sample_contact_phone = 617-714-7563!Sample_contact_laboratory = Matthew Meyerson Lab!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Program!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02142!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481360/suppl/GSM481360_UNLET_p_Sty18_Mapping250K_Sty_D09_79444.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481360/suppl/GSM481360_UNLET_p_Sty18_Mapping250K_Sty_D09_79444.CHP.TXT.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19399!Sample_data_row_count = 238230#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number via tangent normalization!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1909444	1.645132SNP_A-2237149	2.009304SNP_A-4303947	2.003716SNP_A-2236359	1.981237SNP_A-2205441	1.835091SNP_A-2116190	2.075369SNP_A-4291020	1.882262SNP_A-2109914	1.812064SNP_A-2291997	1.875344SNP_A-4277872	1.544876SNP_A-2118217	1.786996SNP_A-1866065	1.987343SNP_A-2288244	2.105070SNP_A-1783407	2.002490SNP_A-2169457	1.691159SNP_A-4271011	1.981084SNP_A-2082515	1.720657SNP_A-1910751	1.677843SNP_A-2081399	1.804500SNP_A-2223642	1.980776!sample_table_end
