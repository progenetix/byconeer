In brief, 250 ng of genomic DNA was digested with the StyI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs), ligated to an adaptor with T4 ligase (New England Biolabs), and PCR-amplified using a 9700 Thermal Cycler I (Applied Biosystems) and Titanium Taq (Clontech) to achieve fragments ranging from 200-1100 bp. These fragments were pooled, concentrated, processed through a clean-up step, and further fragmented with DNaseI (Affymetrix) before being labeled, denatured, and hybridized to arrays!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were washed and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix)!Sample_description = Gastric-Tumor-4559-250K_Sty!Sample_data_processing = Probe-level signal intensities were normalized to a common reference array using quantile normalization and combined to form SNP-level signal intensities using the dChip model-based expression (PM/MM) method . Genome-wide copy number estimates were obtained using tangent normalization, in which tumor signal intensities are divided by signal intensities from the linear combination of all normal samples that is most similar to the tumor (as described in Beroukhim et al, In Press; and Getz et al., In Preparation).  Cancer samples were normalized against a pool of 1,480 reference samples derived from multiple studies; the code and reference data necessary to replicate this analysis are available for download in GEO (accession GSE19399, see GSE19399_tangent_norm_files.tar.gz). GEO Sample tables (VALUE) contain the normalized copy-number values produced by that algorithm.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Steven,E,Schumacher!Sample_contact_email = schum@broadinstitute.org!Sample_contact_phone = (617)501-3709!Sample_contact_laboratory = Beroukhim Lab!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Biology!Sample_contact_institute = Dana-Farber Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 450 Brookline Ave!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM894nnn/GSM894205/suppl/GSM894205_CYMAR_p_STY38_Mapping250K_Sty_E02_183336.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE36459!Sample_series_id = GSE36460!Sample_data_row_count = 238230#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized copy number data.
