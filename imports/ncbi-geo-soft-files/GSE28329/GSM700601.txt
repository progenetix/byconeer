EPCs were obtained by Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) density-gradient centrifugation within 6 hours of collection of bone marrow aspirates, and the 138-negative (Miltenyi Biotec) mononuclear cell layer was resuspended in EndoCult Basal Medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin G, 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin). To eliminate contamination with mature ECs and other adherent BM cells, the mononuclear cells (7 Ã 10^6/well) were plated overnight in laminin-coated, 6-well plates (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA), and non-adherent EPCs were collected and plated in 25 cm2 laminin-coated flasks. Under these culture conditions, characteristic EPC colonies are observed at 5-7 days, and confluence is reached 10-14 days after plating. EPC enrichment was quantitated by growing EPCs in parallel on laminin-coated, 96-well plates (Becton Dickinson Labware) and immunostaining with combinations of antibodies directed against EPC markers, VEGFR-2, CD133, CD144 (vascular endothelial cadherin [VE-cadherin]), and von Willebrand factor (vWF), without evidence of plasma cell (CD38), lymphocyte (CD45), and monocyte (CD11b) contamination and was >98%. To minimize culture-induced genomic changes, only first-passage EPCs were used.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Total genomic DNA (5 Î¼g) for arrays was extracted independently from 6 X 10^6 MM EPCs and tumor cells according to the manufacturerâs instructions using cell lysis and ethanol precipitation (Gentra System Inc., Minneapolis, MN).
