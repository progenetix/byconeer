Quantified intensities for tumor sample were stored as channel 1 (ch1) whereas quantified intensities for reference sample were stored as channel 2 (ch2). Median spot pixel values were used to calculate background corrected intensities (Int1 and Int2). Spots were removed and regarded as missing values if either: (1) flagged during image-analysis, (2) background corrected intensity value >64999 signal units, (3) background corrected intensity value <0 signal units, or (4) spot diameter less than 40 um. For spots, log ratio (M) was calculated as log2(Int1/Int2) and average intensity (A) was calculated as log10(Int1*Int2)/2. Normalization was performed by applying popLowess (PMID: 17953745). Spots from dye-swap hybridization were merged using geometric mean of ratios after normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM531nnn/GSM531459/suppl/GSM531459_TAX577544_Cy3_1.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM531nnn/GSM531459/suppl/GSM531459_TAX577544_Cy3_2.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21259!Sample_data_row_count = 31963#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference male DNA).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE27039	-0.03665918122668	0.2750188026764	0.2056739113919	-0.13733514826310	0.1992015358167	-0.05764454119040	-0.0326674813568	0.1163441920144	-0.21100123932004	-0.336313233434	-0.36793255317422	-0.3841127775024	-0.14060007613823	-0.459688093266	0.158870805996	0.23682809212918	-0.05515666623855	-0.2639872653448	0.02726058811285	-0.01113751!sample_table_end
