Quantified intensities for tumor sample were stored as channel 1 (ch1) whereas quantified intensities for reference sample were stored as channel 2 (ch2). Median spot pixel values were used to calculate background corrected intensities (Int1 and Int2). Spots were removed and regarded as missing values if either: (1) flagged during image-analysis, (2) background corrected intensity value >64999 signal units, (3) background corrected intensity value <0 signal units, or (4) spot diameter less than 40 um. For spots, log ratio (M) was calculated as log2(Int1/Int2) and average intensity (A) was calculated as log10(Int1*Int2)/2. Normalization was performed by applying popLowess (PMID: 17953745). Spots from dye-swap hybridization were merged using geometric mean of ratios after normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM531nnn/GSM531456/suppl/GSM531456_TAX577490_Cy3_1.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21259!Sample_data_row_count = 31963#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference male DNA).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE27039	-0.03599259822668	-0.0372019096764	-0.11684110113919	-0.0288362526310	0.1919538398167	-0.13712931819040	-0.24024828613568	0.26154134320144	-0.06866144432004	-0.4194988333434	-0.47989256517422	-0.5256133015024	-0.37064088813823	0.357291519266	0.159694154996	-0.11839055712918	0.10734474923855	0.1912189743448	0.30902211911285	-0.116150597!sample_table_end
