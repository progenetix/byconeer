Quantified intensities for tumor sample were stored as channel 1 (ch1) whereas quantified intensities for reference sample were stored as channel 2 (ch2). Median spot pixel values were used to calculate background corrected intensities (Int1 and Int2). Spots were removed and regarded as missing values if either: (1) flagged during image-analysis, (2) background corrected intensity value >64999 signal units, (3) background corrected intensity value <0 signal units, or (4) spot diameter less than 40 um. For spots, log ratio (M) was calculated as log2(Int1/Int2) and average intensity (A) was calculated as log10(Int1*Int2)/2. Normalization was performed by applying popLowess (PMID: 17953745). Spots from dye-swap hybridization were merged using geometric mean of ratios after normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7247!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM531nnn/GSM531497/suppl/GSM531497_TAX577645_Cy3_1.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM531nnn/GSM531497/suppl/GSM531497_TAX577645_Cy5_1.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21259!Sample_data_row_count = 32573#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference male DNA).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE28065	0.07740910223532	0.2035188997034	-0.21997136614459	0.00242457427309	0.0595559218491	0.07594051919769	-0.00174339614081	0.01515667420900	-0.10380669133192	0.33499919534676	-0.07581608718070	-0.184520845213	-0.24721304214336	0.172019464293	0.0391628651050	0.293771213404	0.01030557224746	0.3159305043583	0.1359561111717	null!sample_table_end
