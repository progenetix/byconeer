Quantified intensities for tumor sample were stored as channel 1 (ch1) whereas quantified intensities for reference sample were stored as channel 2 (ch2). Median spot pixel values were used to calculate background corrected intensities (Int1 and Int2). Spots were removed and regarded as missing values if either: (1) flagged during image-analysis, (2) background corrected intensity value >64999 signal units, (3) background corrected intensity value <0 signal units, or (4) spot diameter less than 40 um. For spots, log ratio (M) was calculated as log2(Int1/Int2) and average intensity (A) was calculated as log10(Int1*Int2)/2. Normalization was performed by applying popLowess (PMID: 17953745). Spots from dye-swap hybridization were merged using geometric mean of ratios after normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM531nnn/GSM531443/suppl/GSM531443_TAX577022_Cy3_1.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21259!Sample_series_id = GSE32578!Sample_data_row_count = 31963#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference male DNA).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE27039	-0.30035221222668	-0.0131192636764	-0.14849580813919	-0.33226974226310	0.2193220918167	0.02858332619040	-0.39733915513568	0.33595776620144	0.03401414532004	-0.24624285333434	-0.06527142517422	-0.3105067935024	0.05133436613823	0.130876324266	0.152721162996	0.29419608112918	0.31752935623855	0.0172146293448	-0.0926315711285	0.0345129!sample_table_end
