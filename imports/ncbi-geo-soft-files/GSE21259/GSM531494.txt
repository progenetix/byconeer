Quantified intensities for tumor sample were stored as channel 1 (ch1) whereas quantified intensities for reference sample were stored as channel 2 (ch2). Median spot pixel values were used to calculate background corrected intensities (Int1 and Int2). Spots were removed and regarded as missing values if either: (1) flagged during image-analysis, (2) background corrected intensity value >64999 signal units, (3) background corrected intensity value <0 signal units, or (4) spot diameter less than 40 um. For spots, log ratio (M) was calculated as log2(Int1/Int2) and average intensity (A) was calculated as log10(Int1*Int2)/2. Normalization was performed by applying popLowess (PMID: 17953745). Spots from dye-swap hybridization were merged using geometric mean of ratios after normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7247!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM531nnn/GSM531494/suppl/GSM531494_TAX577665_Cy3_1.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21259!Sample_data_row_count = 32573#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference male DNA).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE28065	0.12703558523532	0.1976713767034	-0.31159437314459	0.22427140127309	0.2805297648491	0.17407009519769	0.00676031714081	0.09349352420900	0.1483441933192	-0.61680318434676	-0.06448824518070	-0.2802610255213	0.16640569314336	0.250607492293	0.2375106841050	0.15847647113404	-0.11024552224746	0.3195051823583	0.05908486411717	-0.116031295!sample_table_end
