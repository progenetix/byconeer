Quantified intensities for tumor sample were stored as channel 1 (ch1) whereas quantified intensities for reference sample were stored as channel 2 (ch2). Median spot pixel values were used to calculate background corrected intensities (Int1 and Int2). Spots were removed and regarded as missing values if either: (1) flagged during image-analysis, (2) background corrected intensity value >64999 signal units, (3) background corrected intensity value <0 signal units, or (4) spot diameter less than 40 um. For spots, log ratio (M) was calculated as log2(Int1/Int2) and average intensity (A) was calculated as log10(Int1*Int2)/2. Normalization was performed by applying popLowess (PMID: 17953745). Spots from dye-swap hybridization were merged using geometric mean of ratios after normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7247!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM531nnn/GSM531501/suppl/GSM531501_TAX577620_Cy3_1.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21259!Sample_data_row_count = 32573#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference male DNA).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE28065	0.16469722623532	-0.0089813447034	-0.20691241414459	0.0049677227309	0.2595751168491	-0.54620482719769	-0.13294427314081	-0.09394615820900	0.03022325233192	-0.2438296734676	-0.15027810918070	-0.4575581215213	-0.51809016414336	-0.447703665293	0.1215749171050	0.07703091113404	-0.08581181924746	0.057821123583	-0.15989494411717	0.025947905!sample_table_end
