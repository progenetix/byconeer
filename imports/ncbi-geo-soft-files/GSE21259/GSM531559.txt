Quantified intensities for tumor sample were stored as channel 1 (ch1) whereas quantified intensities for reference sample were stored as channel 2 (ch2). Median spot pixel values were used to calculate background corrected intensities (Int1 and Int2). Spots were removed and regarded as missing values if either: (1) flagged during image-analysis, (2) background corrected intensity value >64999 signal units, (3) background corrected intensity value <0 signal units, or (4) spot diameter less than 40 um. For spots, log ratio (M) was calculated as log2(Int1/Int2) and average intensity (A) was calculated as log10(Int1*Int2)/2. Normalization was performed by applying popLowess (PMID: 17953745). Spots from dye-swap hybridization were merged using geometric mean of ratios after normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9077!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM531nnn/GSM531559/suppl/GSM531559_TAX577689_Cy3_1.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21259!Sample_data_row_count = 37104#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference male DNA).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE32430	-0.13067377927153	-0.0282476398177	0.22265982723499	-0.02074515616712	-0.09537012331560	-0.1177751129850	0.17249509522886	-0.04933715316244	0.01414929424095	0.31363585438193	-0.18541284639959	-0.20659496520791	0.1732310066056	-0.069617116493	0.047119616362	-0.074285611233	-0.37043296222632	-0.05693898815471	-0.00681239528523	-0.241601141!sample_table_end
