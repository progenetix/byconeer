Quantified intensities for tumor sample were stored as channel 1 (ch1) whereas quantified intensities for reference sample were stored as channel 2 (ch2). Median spot pixel values were used to calculate background corrected intensities (Int1 and Int2). Spots were removed and regarded as missing values if either: (1) flagged during image-analysis, (2) background corrected intensity value >64999 signal units, (3) background corrected intensity value <0 signal units, or (4) spot diameter less than 40 um. For spots, log ratio (M) was calculated as log2(Int1/Int2) and average intensity (A) was calculated as log10(Int1*Int2)/2. Normalization was performed by applying popLowess (PMID: 17953745). Spots from dye-swap hybridization were merged using geometric mean of ratios after normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7247!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM531nnn/GSM531530/suppl/GSM531530_TAX577673_Cy3_1.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21259!Sample_data_row_count = 32573#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference male DNA).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE28065	0.14646588623532	0.1175626967034	-0.03265654914459	0.18157509627309	0.3732540228491	0.04545095319769	-0.22263183214081	-0.05932319420900	-0.16770493833192	-0.32340701834676	0.20090387318070	-0.1640841915213	0.39013225414336	-0.354964795293	0.0862013011050	-0.38432425113404	0.21120080524746	0.1069631953583	0.03910281411717	null!sample_table_end
