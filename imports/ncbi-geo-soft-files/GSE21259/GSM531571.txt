Quantified intensities for tumor sample were stored as channel 1 (ch1) whereas quantified intensities for reference sample were stored as channel 2 (ch2). Median spot pixel values were used to calculate background corrected intensities (Int1 and Int2). Spots were removed and regarded as missing values if either: (1) flagged during image-analysis, (2) background corrected intensity value >64999 signal units, (3) background corrected intensity value <0 signal units, or (4) spot diameter less than 40 um. For spots, log ratio (M) was calculated as log2(Int1/Int2) and average intensity (A) was calculated as log10(Int1*Int2)/2. Normalization was performed by applying popLowess (PMID: 17953745). Spots from dye-swap hybridization were merged using geometric mean of ratios after normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9077!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM531nnn/GSM531571/suppl/GSM531571_TAX577714_Cy3_1.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21259!Sample_data_row_count = 37104#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference male DNA).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE32430	0.00718890927153	0.1363428318177	0.34919449523499	-0.00512362216712	-0.29705448431560	0.2364237129850	0.16194072722886	-0.06315747216244	0.0855042424095	0.1058644338193	-0.09819397839959	-0.19026820791	0.1240982266056	-0.03383424416493	-0.08013951362	0.0733240181233	-0.04351123122632	-0.0104149315471	-0.23380768228523	0.084805644!sample_table_end
