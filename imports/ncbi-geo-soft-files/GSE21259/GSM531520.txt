Quantified intensities for tumor sample were stored as channel 1 (ch1) whereas quantified intensities for reference sample were stored as channel 2 (ch2). Median spot pixel values were used to calculate background corrected intensities (Int1 and Int2). Spots were removed and regarded as missing values if either: (1) flagged during image-analysis, (2) background corrected intensity value >64999 signal units, (3) background corrected intensity value <0 signal units, or (4) spot diameter less than 40 um. For spots, log ratio (M) was calculated as log2(Int1/Int2) and average intensity (A) was calculated as log10(Int1*Int2)/2. Normalization was performed by applying popLowess (PMID: 17953745). Spots from dye-swap hybridization were merged using geometric mean of ratios after normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7247!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM531nnn/GSM531520/suppl/GSM531520_TAX577634_Cy3_1.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM531nnn/GSM531520/suppl/GSM531520_TAX577634_Cy5_1.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21259!Sample_data_row_count = 32573#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference male DNA).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE28065	0.21521338423532	-0.1088841257034	0.17318449914459	0.09676226127309	0.1816825578491	-0.0133261719769	-0.00378588414081	0.22137507720900	-0.530950633192	0.22656078634676	-0.16365456418070	-0.03082785213	0.38531815314336	-0.238727334293	-0.945352461050	-0.21535284113404	0.13239885524746	0.3265994953583	0.15657594211717	0.500662658!sample_table_end
