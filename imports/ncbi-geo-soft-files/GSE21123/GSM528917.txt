Cell line signal intensities were normalized to a baseline array with median intensity and quantile normalization in GenePattern based on the dChipSNP algorithm. SNP-level inteisities were obtained for these using the model-based PM/MM method. Data from each were compared to data from 1800 normal datasets, and the 5 normal samples with noise profiles most similar to each cell line were used to determine log2 ratios at each SNP locus.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized tumor/normal ratio data described above are presented in the Sample data tables of the Tumor sample (normal Samples therefore do not have data tables).  The matrix of ratio data is also available as a text file on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Barry,Stephen,Taylor!Sample_contact_institute = Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 1275 York Avenue, Box #460!Sample_contact_city = New York!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 10065!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM528nnn/GSM528917/suppl/GSM528917.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21123!Sample_series_id = GSE21124!Sample_data_row_count = 238300#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 copy-number ratio tumor/normal!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1909444	-0.622544SNP_A-2237149	0.1054805SNP_A-4303947	-0.471541SNP_A-2236359	-0.206259SNP_A-2205441	-0.421668SNP_A-2116190	-0.03096SNP_A-4291020	0.01893SNP_A-2109914	0.114571SNP_A-2291997	-0.6516325SNP_A-4277872	-0.2291005SNP_A-2118217	0.1991945SNP_A-1866065	-0.7697245SNP_A-2288244	-0.4989645SNP_A-1783407	-0.831819SNP_A-2169457	-0.4381815SNP_A-4271011	-0.238466SNP_A-2082515	-0.415877SNP_A-1910751	-0.4347285SNP_A-2081399	-0.722012SNP_A-2223642	0.017377!sample_table_end
