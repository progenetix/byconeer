Cell line signal intensities were normalized to a baseline array with median intensity and quantile normalization in GenePattern based on the dChipSNP algorithm. SNP-level inteisities were obtained for these using the model-based PM/MM method. Data from each were compared to data from 1800 normal datasets, and the 5 normal samples with noise profiles most similar to each cell line were used to determine log2 ratios at each SNP locus.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized tumor/normal ratio data described above are presented in the Sample data tables of the Tumor sample (normal Samples therefore do not have data tables).  The matrix of ratio data is also available as a text file on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Barry,Stephen,Taylor!Sample_contact_institute = Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 1275 York Avenue, Box #460!Sample_contact_city = New York!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 10065!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM529nnn/GSM529092/suppl/GSM529092.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21123!Sample_series_id = GSE21124!Sample_data_row_count = 238300#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 copy-number ratio tumor/normal!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1909444	-0.031601SNP_A-2237149	0.2101485SNP_A-4303947	-0.046041SNP_A-2236359	-0.662939SNP_A-2205441	0.154081SNP_A-2116190	0.316034SNP_A-4291020	-0.152605SNP_A-2109914	0.008306SNP_A-2291997	-0.1471515SNP_A-4277872	-0.3746815SNP_A-2118217	-0.1006465SNP_A-1866065	-0.1057845SNP_A-2288244	0.0609255SNP_A-1783407	0.060869SNP_A-2169457	0.0152415SNP_A-4271011	0.324234SNP_A-2082515	-0.021641SNP_A-1910751	-0.1005945SNP_A-2081399	-0.600767SNP_A-2223642	0.287863!sample_table_end
