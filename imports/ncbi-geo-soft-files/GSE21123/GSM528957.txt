Cell line signal intensities were normalized to a baseline array with median intensity and quantile normalization in GenePattern based on the dChipSNP algorithm. SNP-level inteisities were obtained for these using the model-based PM/MM method. Data from each were compared to data from 1800 normal datasets, and the 5 normal samples with noise profiles most similar to each cell line were used to determine log2 ratios at each SNP locus.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized tumor/normal ratio data described above are presented in the Sample data tables of the Tumor sample (normal Samples therefore do not have data tables).  The matrix of ratio data is also available as a text file on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Barry,Stephen,Taylor!Sample_contact_institute = Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 1275 York Avenue, Box #460!Sample_contact_city = New York!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 10065!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM528nnn/GSM528957/suppl/GSM528957.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21123!Sample_series_id = GSE21124!Sample_data_row_count = 238300#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 copy-number ratio tumor/normal!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1909444	-0.840094SNP_A-2237149	-0.5330725SNP_A-4303947	-0.62696SNP_A-2236359	-1.164931SNP_A-2205441	-1.021714SNP_A-2116190	-0.082522SNP_A-4291020	-0.197863SNP_A-2109914	-0.190748SNP_A-2291997	-0.6496345SNP_A-4277872	-0.6338535SNP_A-2118217	0.3854395SNP_A-1866065	-0.6615195SNP_A-2288244	-0.7808145SNP_A-1783407	-0.361692SNP_A-2169457	-0.8282815SNP_A-4271011	-0.744863SNP_A-2082515	-0.70277SNP_A-1910751	-0.5082395SNP_A-2081399	-0.46378SNP_A-2223642	-0.259038!sample_table_end
