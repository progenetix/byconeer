Cell line signal intensities were normalized to a baseline array with median intensity and quantile normalization in GenePattern based on the dChipSNP algorithm. SNP-level inteisities were obtained for these using the model-based PM/MM method. Data from each were compared to data from 1800 normal datasets, and the 5 normal samples with noise profiles most similar to each cell line were used to determine log2 ratios at each SNP locus.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized tumor/normal ratio data described above are presented in the Sample data tables of the Tumor sample (normal Samples therefore do not have data tables).  The matrix of ratio data is also available as a text file on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Barry,Stephen,Taylor!Sample_contact_institute = Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 1275 York Avenue, Box #460!Sample_contact_city = New York!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 10065!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM528nnn/GSM528938/suppl/GSM528938.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21123!Sample_series_id = GSE21124!Sample_data_row_count = 238300#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 copy-number ratio tumor/normal!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1909444	-0.439354SNP_A-2237149	0.1369105SNP_A-4303947	-0.576627SNP_A-2236359	-0.243076SNP_A-2205441	-0.47041SNP_A-2116190	-0.00912SNP_A-4291020	0.153365SNP_A-2109914	-0.026363SNP_A-2291997	-0.4993935SNP_A-4277872	-0.0346925SNP_A-2118217	0.2634185SNP_A-1866065	-0.5638345SNP_A-2288244	-0.4316935SNP_A-1783407	-0.591731SNP_A-2169457	-0.8024385SNP_A-4271011	-0.206157SNP_A-2082515	-0.340609SNP_A-1910751	-0.2912745SNP_A-2081399	-0.78325SNP_A-2223642	0.176749!sample_table_end
