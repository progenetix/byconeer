Cell line signal intensities were normalized to a baseline array with median intensity and quantile normalization in GenePattern based on the dChipSNP algorithm. SNP-level inteisities were obtained for these using the model-based PM/MM method. Data from each were compared to data from 1800 normal datasets, and the 5 normal samples with noise profiles most similar to each cell line were used to determine log2 ratios at each SNP locus.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized tumor/normal ratio data described above are presented in the Sample data tables of the Tumor sample (normal Samples therefore do not have data tables).  The matrix of ratio data is also available as a text file on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Barry,Stephen,Taylor!Sample_contact_institute = Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 1275 York Avenue, Box #460!Sample_contact_city = New York!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 10065!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM529nnn/GSM529134/suppl/GSM529134.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21123!Sample_series_id = GSE21124!Sample_data_row_count = 0
