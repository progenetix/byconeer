Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454254/suppl/GSM454254_1526.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.113030611	0.028248432G000002	-0.338645684	-0.40445802G000003	-0.339722677	-0.211353968G000004	-0.064350568	0.042815511G000005	0.046130676	0.042815511G000006	-0.035038036	-0.19388399G000007	-0.335322204	-0.19388399G000008	-0.519816687	-0.523337275G000009	-0.329079967	-0.403904835G000010	-0.352212303	-0.403904835G000011	-0.386382366	-0.403904835G000012	-0.687298059	-0.403904835G000013	-0.272783691	-0.390135137G000014		G000015	0.001433941	-0.015371275G000016	-0.013323096	-0.015371275G000017	0.015912425	-0.015371275G000018	-0.030919643	-0.015371275G000019	-0.052698545	-0.015371275G000020	-0.033500417	-0.015371275!sample_table_end
