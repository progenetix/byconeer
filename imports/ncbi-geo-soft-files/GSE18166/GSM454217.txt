Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454217/suppl/GSM454217_1515.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.015060333	-0.023629819G000002	0.014518986	-0.023629819G000003	-0.014846342	-0.023629819G000004	-0.015216687	-0.023629819G000005	-0.147865134	-0.023629819G000006	0.103655674	-0.023629819G000007	-0.047269942	-0.023629819G000008	-0.004519334	-0.023629819G000009	0.061987232	-0.023629819G000010	0.009881648	-0.023629819G000011	-0.00096139	-0.023629819G000012	0.02203492	-0.023629819G000013	-0.025368689	-0.023629819G000014		G000015	-0.052998769	-0.023629819G000016	-0.022295735	-0.023629819G000017	0.004859246	-0.023629819G000018	-0.014737395	-0.023629819G000019	-0.047096172	-0.023629819G000020	-0.032576883	-0.023629819!sample_table_end
