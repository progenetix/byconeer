Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454202/suppl/GSM454202_1472.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.078386014	0.067048178G000002	0.001647843	0.061823164G000003	0.023083623	0.061823164G000004	0.061324784	0.061823164G000005	0.088354881	0.061823164G000006	0.064302797	0.061823164G000007	0.083272294	0.061823164G000008	0.036674397	0.061823164G000009	0.13503028	0.061823164G000010	0.063394491	0.061823164G000011	0.059869716	0.061823164G000012	0.118238258	0.061823164G000013	-0.023093175	0.061823164G000014		G000015	0.051230342	0.061823164G000016	0.017192128	0.061823164G000017	0.116408411	0.061823164G000018	-0.489299787	-0.36655791G000019	-0.562457178	-0.36655791G000020	-0.597298764	-0.583259556!sample_table_end
