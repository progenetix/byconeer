Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454186/suppl/GSM454186_2988.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.084360006	0.018058796G000002	0.035757891	0.018058796G000003	-0.520202185	-0.521025174G000004	0.014435441	0.016644949G000005	-0.024360702	0.016644949G000006	0.167909898	0.016644949G000007	0.046155331	0.016644949G000008	0.016255064	0.016644949G000009	0.076216787	0.016644949G000010	0.12410081	0.016644949G000011	-0.047545085	0.016644949G000012	-0.529883156	-0.516702531G000013	-0.474674705	-0.474674705G000014		G000015	-0.010519031	0.009012461G000016	-0.022659002	0.009012461G000017	0.054331572	0.009012461G000018	0.008611018	0.009012461G000019	0.007304022	0.009012461G000020	0.060836379	0.009012461!sample_table_end
