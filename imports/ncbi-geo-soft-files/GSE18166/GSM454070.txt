Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454070/suppl/GSM454070_1452.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.018319815	0.022288525G000002	-0.026157951	0.022288525G000003	-0.001695446	0.022288525G000004	0.018731463	0.022288525G000005	-0.090233373	0.022288525G000006	0.024706285	0.022288525G000007	0.020703538	0.036024491G000008	0.021926707	0.036024491G000009	0.071408783	0.025447408G000010	0.034898704	0.025447408G000011	0.033703725	0.025447408G000012	0.050677698	0.025447408G000013	0.032156904	0.025447408G000014		G000015	0.009490792	0.025447408G000016	0.020738547	0.025447408G000017	0.024136911	0.025447408G000018	0.021628233	0.025447408G000019	-0.013444439	0.025447408G000020	-0.000211217	0.025447408!sample_table_end
