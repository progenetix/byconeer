Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454220/suppl/GSM454220_1507.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.063164913	0.027446243G000002	-0.005350155	0.027446243G000003	-0.071280184	0.027446243G000004	-0.114540171	0.027446243G000005	-0.075192244	0.027446243G000006	0.055316995	0.027446243G000007	0.004039016	0.027446243G000008	-0.032088751	0.027446243G000009	0.126659631	0.027446243G000010	0.009596515	0.027446243G000011	0.019904103	0.027446243G000012	0.080440863	0.027446243G000013	-0.003823516	0.027446243G000014		G000015	-0.174277367	-0.003183101G000016	0.017115769	-0.003183101G000017	0.070949096	-0.003183101G000018	0.007239376	-0.003183101G000019	0.031153655	-0.003183101G000020	0.10127473	-0.003183101!sample_table_end
