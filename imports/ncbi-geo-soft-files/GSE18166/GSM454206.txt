Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454206/suppl/GSM454206_2998.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.107785217	-0.067447429G000002	0.024635435	-0.067447429G000003	0.237571678	-0.067447429G000004	-0.060484045	-0.067447429G000005	-0.04497256	-0.067447429G000006	0.011979067	-0.067447429G000007	0.012316099	-0.067447429G000008	0.026268941	-0.067447429G000009	0.028722292	-0.067447429G000010	-0.00803821	-0.067447429G000011	-0.06400353	-0.067447429G000012	-0.201203904	-0.067447429G000013	-0.127532544	-0.067447429G000014		G000015	-0.117208876	-0.067447429G000016	-0.089650353	-0.067447429G000017	-0.152454796	-0.067447429G000018	-0.152214083	-0.067447429G000019	-0.109820085	-0.067447429G000020	-0.116332531	-0.067447429!sample_table_end
