Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454045/suppl/GSM454045_1510.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.056442671	0.054754193G000002	-0.690937182	-0.610140042G000003	0.002520923	0.032150752G000004	-0.041773155	0.032150752G000005	-0.152214314	-0.144242321G000006	0.092144471	0.024649203G000007	0.054507739	0.024649203G000008	-0.00703444	0.024649203G000009	0.050774177	0.01024039G000010	0.078965355	0.01024039G000011	0.064596531	0.01024039G000012	0.068205577	0.01024039G000013	0.050236014	0.01024039G000014		G000015	0.012633554	0.01024039G000016	-0.019920763	0.01024039G000017	0.06574649	0.01024039G000018	0.03315304	0.01024039G000019	0.031299036	0.01024039G000020	0.017988776	0.01024039!sample_table_end
