Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454193/suppl/GSM454193_1470.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	-0.191745973	-0.202398257G000002	-0.5206414	-0.489286905G000003	-0.537937808	-0.414025127G000004	-0.628413182	-0.414025127G000005	-0.485834563	-0.414025127G000006	-0.416575195	-0.414025127G000007	-0.352219497	-0.414025127G000008	-0.505390131	-0.414025127G000009	-0.334062682	-0.341580525G000010	-0.353489477	-0.341580525G000011	-0.429368921	-0.341580525G000012	-0.641004767	-0.528089802G000013	-0.462111294	-0.413163019G000014		G000015	-0.488399675	-0.413163019G000016	-0.586435173	-0.413163019G000017	-0.60951412	-0.413163019G000018	-0.50340225	-0.413163019G000019	-0.550526064	-0.413163019G000020	-0.574518567	-0.486501912!sample_table_end
