Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454170/suppl/GSM454170_4631.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.113321317	0.26812608G000002	0.077012354	0.035670541G000003	0.005747649	0.035670541G000004	0.009667382	0.035670541G000005	0.070261189	0.035670541G000006	0.080167247	0.035670541G000007	0.037530917	0.035670541G000008	0.08982968	0.035670541G000009	0.145999011	0.035670541G000010	0.083305277	0.035670541G000011	0.074619915	0.035670541G000012	0.031275183	0.035670541G000013	0.050909373	0.035670541G000014		G000015	-0.050032549	0.035670541G000016	0.065418605	0.035670541G000017	0.067507408	0.035670541G000018	0.054277109	0.035670541G000019	0.056854793	0.035670541G000020	0.04539198	0.035670541!sample_table_end
