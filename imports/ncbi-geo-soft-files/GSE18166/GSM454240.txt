Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454240/suppl/GSM454240_6071.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.173681509	0.220315079G000002	0.21969928	0.220315079G000003	0.232289844	0.220315079G000004	0.241654493	0.220315079G000005	0.219078664	0.220315079G000006	0.204124437	0.220315079G000007	0.297633022	0.220315079G000008	0.252755905	0.220315079G000009	0.383490429	0.244050229G000010	0.235434355	0.244050229G000011	0.231327387	0.244050229G000012	0.22718748	0.244050229G000013	0.266623831	0.244050229G000014		G000015	0.314323468	0.244050229G000016	0.279843962	0.244050229G000017	0.267326822	0.244050229G000018	0.210233904	0.244050229G000019	0.297577424	0.244050229G000020	0.360581474	0.244050229!sample_table_end
