Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454102/suppl/GSM454102_1485.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.144599286	0.006381449G000002	0.030684886	0.006381449G000003	0.029727881	0.006381449G000004	0.046093975	0.065277073G000005	-0.052805497	0.065277073G000006	0.011474969	0.065277073G000007	0.08799323	0.065277073G000008	0.11817551	0.065277073G000009	0.104467909	0.065277073G000010	-0.038900278	0.065277073G000011	0.018236366	0.065277073G000012	0.104055642	0.065277073G000013	0.056721187	0.065277073G000014		G000015	0.058168515	0.065277073G000016	0.082240137	0.065277073G000017	0.089826067	0.065277073G000018	0.035144054	0.065277073G000019	0.033440783	0.065277073G000020	0.052939733	0.065277073!sample_table_end
