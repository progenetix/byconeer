Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454076/suppl/GSM454076_4630.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.082853898	0.082853898G000002	-0.046307439	-0.013969854G000003	-0.0919922	-0.013969854G000004	0.006250421	-0.013969854G000005	0.019134009	-0.013969854G000006	-0.07312566	-0.013969854G000007	0.005863041	-0.013969854G000008	0.018889055	-0.013969854G000009	0.033037524	-0.013969854G000010	-0.080422831	-0.013969854G000011	0.055595379	-0.013969854G000012	-0.059638567	-0.013969854G000013	-0.032132627	-0.013969854G000014		G000015	-0.075501648	-0.013969854G000016	-0.078249158	-0.013969854G000017	0.012959861	-0.013969854G000018	0.042303527	-0.013969854G000019	-0.033182297	-0.013969854G000020	-0.018547362	-0.013969854!sample_table_end
