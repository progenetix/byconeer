Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454182/suppl/GSM454182_4637.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.086607313	0.090047194G000002	-0.579468124	-0.531210704G000003	-0.544387985	-0.563619464G000004	0.029443905	0.038292711G000005	0.079914752	0.038292711G000006	0.08083887	0.038292711G000007	0.058665225	0.038292711G000008	0.02082343	0.038292711G000009	0.107623965	0.038292711G000010	0.05083143	0.038292711G000011	0.084589215	0.038292711G000012	0.04521354	0.038292711G000013	0.063508126	0.038292711G000014		G000015	0.042538745	0.038292711G000016	0.022433279	0.038292711G000017	0.04758921	0.038292711G000018	0.043764995	0.038292711G000019	0.053105398	0.038292711G000020	0.074173684	0.038292711!sample_table_end
