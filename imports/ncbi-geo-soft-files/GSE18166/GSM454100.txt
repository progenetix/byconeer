Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454100/suppl/GSM454100_2990.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.026832051	0.007132954G000002	-0.007300132	0.007132954G000003	0.038147846	0.007132954G000004	0.069425668	0.007132954G000005	0.061221865	0.007132954G000006	0.115435178	0.007132954G000007	0.020348742	0.007132954G000008	0.002194192	0.007132954G000009	0.106314584	0.005716492G000010	0.070896622	0.005716492G000011	0.077857145	0.005716492G000012	0.068892072	0.005716492G000013	0.025951515	0.005716492G000014		G000015	0.043736053	0.005716492G000016	0.038075875	0.005716492G000017	0.028344798	0.005716492G000018	0.023211511	0.005716492G000019	0.037455141	0.005716492G000020	0.021092557	0.005716492!sample_table_end
