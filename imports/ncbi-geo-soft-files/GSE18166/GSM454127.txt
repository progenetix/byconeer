Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454127/suppl/GSM454127_4617.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.172291922	0.054175887G000002	0.092746577	0.054175887G000003	0.128711476	0.054175887G000004	0.071854179	0.054175887G000005	0.01615712	0.054175887G000006	0.078494679	0.054175887G000007	0.11881335	0.054175887G000008	0.1040944	0.054175887G000009	0.160886872	0.054175887G000010	0.119764406	0.054175887G000011	0.108736195	0.054175887G000012	0.037917474	0.054175887G000013	0.139264181	0.054175887G000014		G000015	0.072635319	0.054175887G000016	0.079854339	0.054175887G000017	0.06187399	0.054175887G000018	0.063144162	0.054175887G000019	0.064979796	0.054175887G000020	0.075206567	0.054175887!sample_table_end
