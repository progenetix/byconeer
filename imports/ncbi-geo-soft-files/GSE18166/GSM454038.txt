Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454038/suppl/GSM454038_1641.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.067278585	0.019363878G000002	-0.042735643	0.019363878G000003	-0.031169144	0.019363878G000004	-0.015174483	0.019363878G000005	0.031935301	0.019363878G000006	0.025092359	0.019363878G000007	0.011679804	0.019363878G000008	0.026164149	0.019363878G000009	0.058013303	0.019363878G000010	0.00075422	0.019363878G000011	0.009047981	0.019363878G000012	-0.025114944	0.019363878G000013	-0.004774476	0.019363878G000014		G000015	0.000803851	0.019363878G000016	0.020732178	0.019363878G000017	0.031340838	0.019363878G000018	-0.006812919	0.019363878G000019	0.006096818	0.019363878G000020	0.071686544	0.019363878!sample_table_end
