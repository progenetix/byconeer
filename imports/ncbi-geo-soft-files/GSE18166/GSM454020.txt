Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454020/suppl/GSM454020_1518.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.208406786	0.164300129G000002	-0.452420316	-0.362521289G000003	-0.437513528	-0.356421134G000004	-0.008461318	0.053438907G000005	-0.177976692	0.053438907G000006	0.065856102	0.053438907G000007	0.110034097	0.053438907G000008	0.084522689	0.053438907G000009	0.097985958	0.053438907G000010	0.124483719	0.053438907G000011	0.032231663	0.053438907G000012	-0.01336245	0.053438907G000013	0.04043387	0.053438907G000014		G000015	0.038762549	0.053438907G000016	-0.026770081	0.053438907G000017	0.018499962	0.053438907G000018	-0.027778681	0.053438907G000019	-0.027824894	0.053438907G000020	0.024849303	0.053438907!sample_table_end
