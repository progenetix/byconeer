Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454055/suppl/GSM454055_1649.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	-0.004717325	-0.104420738G000002	-0.153537378	-0.104420738G000003	-0.090613635	-0.104420738G000004	0.031586758	0.047366914G000005	-0.027627249	0.047366914G000006	0.029986588	0.047366914G000007	0.102547369	0.047366914G000008	0.068588198	0.047366914G000009	0.083521948	0.047366914G000010	-0.018463659	0.047366914G000011	0.015151178	0.047366914G000012	0.057115715	0.047366914G000013	-0.013846965	0.047366914G000014		G000015	0.015948747	0.047366914G000016	0.054234258	0.047366914G000017	0.005496097	0.047366914G000018	0.016477587	0.047366914G000019	-0.024209366	0.047366914G000020	0.059667223	0.047366914!sample_table_end
