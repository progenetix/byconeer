Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454123/suppl/GSM454123_1650.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.406120821	0.287945363G000002	0.334650824	0.264981852G000003	0.260236332	0.264981852G000004	0.357870972	0.264981852G000005	0.14737233	0.102991527G000006	0.1470106	0.102991527G000007	0.236132496	0.102991527G000008	0.153173705	0.102991527G000009	0.232040961	0.102991527G000010	0.116546733	0.102991527G000011	0.148849497	0.102991527G000012	0.086232223	0.102991527G000013	0.193144564	0.102991527G000014		G000015	0.177759494	0.102991527G000016	0.110703075	0.102991527G000017	0.090647147	0.102991527G000018	0.124913678	0.102991527G000019	0.152190831	0.102991527G000020	0.048727966	0.102991527!sample_table_end
