Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454213/suppl/GSM454213_1465.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.083091787	0.018218808G000002	0.061866632	0.018218808G000003	0.04330125	0.018218808G000004	0.099299435	0.018218808G000005	-0.068027553	0.018218808G000006	0.121296942	0.018218808G000007	0.076283245	0.018218808G000008	0.023053677	0.018218808G000009	0.099002402	0.018218808G000010	0.087593524	0.018218808G000011	0.029777301	0.018218808G000012	-0.058321199	0.018218808G000013	-0.009897252	0.018218808G000014		G000015	-0.006391433	0.018218808G000016	-0.032963741	0.018218808G000017	0.014193471	0.018218808G000018	-0.047978099	0.018218808G000019	-0.070378564	0.018218808G000020	-0.011245943	0.018218808!sample_table_end
