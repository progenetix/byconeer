Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454069/suppl/GSM454069_4642.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.128555832	0.014594297G000002	0.028413584	0.014594297G000003	-0.014856266	0.014594297G000004	0.044549733	0.014594297G000005	0.025766172	0.014594297G000006	0.028802282	0.014594297G000007	0.054388873	0.014594297G000008	-0.441500782	-0.381441886G000009	0.093750242	0.011333355G000010	0.019204437	0.011333355G000011	0.017804942	0.011333355G000012	0.024212838	0.011333355G000013	0.041192166	0.011333355G000014		G000015	0.110669196	0.011333355G000016	0.039492122	0.011333355G000017	0.036726972	0.011333355G000018	-0.02448065	0.011333355G000019	0.009597095	0.011333355G000020	0.057173563	0.011333355!sample_table_end
