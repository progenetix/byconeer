Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454052/suppl/GSM454052_1454.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.045879799	0.004959079G000002	-0.060396745	0.004959079G000003	-0.03066556	0.004959079G000004	-0.045556793	0.002499649G000005	-0.047817475	0.002499649G000006	-0.024174719	0.002499649G000007	-0.027061631	0.002499649G000008	-0.01248988	0.002499649G000009	0.011363005	0.002499649G000010	-0.030534414	0.002499649G000011	-0.009471956	0.002499649G000012		G000013	0.002518307	0.002499649G000014		G000015	-0.035088257	0.002499649G000016	-0.042181357	0.002499649G000017	0.002818886	0.002499649G000018	-0.033643413	0.002499649G000019	-0.028617963	0.002499649G000020	-0.030467008	0.002499649!sample_table_end
