Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454015/suppl/GSM454015_1691.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.190285076	0.060410513G000002	0.090608205	0.060410513G000003	0.142169438	0.060410513G000004	0.112702676	0.060410513G000005	-0.012442548	0.060410513G000006	0.090281967	0.060410513G000007	0.114125034	0.060410513G000008	0.125399549	0.060410513G000009	0.168031288	0.060410513G000010	0.11222925	0.060410513G000011	0.103441748	0.060410513G000012	0.088884424	0.060410513G000013	0.101310503	0.060410513G000014		G000015	0.024764615	0.060410513G000016	0.116857321	0.060410513G000017	0.102352473	0.060410513G000018	0.071184584	0.060410513G000019	0.085747882	0.060410513G000020	0.014647533	0.060410513!sample_table_end
