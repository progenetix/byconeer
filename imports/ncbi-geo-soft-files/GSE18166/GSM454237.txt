Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454237/suppl/GSM454237_1477.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	-0.199637246	-0.080227851G000002	-0.005700691	0.02057653G000003	-0.027182416	0.02057653G000004	-0.044527173	0.02057653G000005	0.010285449	0.02057653G000006	0.053631101	0.02057653G000007	0.028718579	0.02057653G000008	-0.012331827	0.02057653G000009	0.601640827	0.56452652G000010	0.595831737	0.56452652G000011	0.519174963	0.56452652G000012	0.200453775	0.229702736G000013	0.159367067	0.229702736G000014		G000015	0.119356451	0.166405953G000016	0.196689782	0.166405953G000017	0.275900327	0.166405953G000018	0.088655332	0.166405953G000019	0.117300864	0.166405953G000020	0.031947443	0.012836846!sample_table_end
