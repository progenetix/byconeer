Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454018/suppl/GSM454018_1493.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.133548041	0.016847102G000002	-0.01256798	0.016847102G000003	-9.38E-05	0.016847102G000004	-0.016491091	0.016847102G000005	-0.198570879	0.016847102G000006	3.11E-05	0.016847102G000007	0.015475095	0.016847102G000008	-0.022220675	0.016847102G000009	0.039887882	0.016847102G000010	0.020227226	0.016847102G000011	-0.029334672	0.016847102G000012	-0.047797369	0.016847102G000013	-0.01400388	0.016847102G000014		G000015	-0.008413512	0.016847102G000016	-0.100438842	0.016847102G000017	0.032203285	0.016847102G000018	-0.032239875	0.016847102G000019	-0.043037305	0.016847102G000020	-0.055776404	0.016847102!sample_table_end
