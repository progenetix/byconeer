Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454115/suppl/GSM454115_4625.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.166171472	0.084971511G000002	0.183351827	0.084971511G000003	0.075895499	0.084971511G000004	0.129296104	0.084971511G000005	0.022062132	0.084971511G000006	0.149382277	0.084971511G000007	0.104472975	0.084971511G000008	0.120625409	0.084971511G000009	0.298393679	0.084971511G000010	0.054602008	0.084971511G000011	0.063033442	0.084971511G000012	0.085378358	0.084971511G000013	0.158760935	0.084971511G000014		G000015	0.118673151	0.084971511G000016	0.099403056	0.084971511G000017	0.126727066	0.084971511G000018	0.007222874	0.084971511G000019	0.055200482	0.084971511G000020	0.135460175	0.084971511!sample_table_end
