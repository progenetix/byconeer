Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454046/suppl/GSM454046_1504.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.076345792	0.085375667G000002	0.067313968	0.085375667G000003	-0.027745051	0.085375667G000004	-0.005797864	0.085375667G000005	-0.070626757	0.085375667G000006	0.113947398	0.085375667G000007	0.114801491	0.085375667G000008	0.045245997	0.085375667G000009	0.152861058	0.085375667G000010	0.148318438	0.085375667G000011	0.158904522	0.085375667G000012	0.018722167	0.085375667G000013	0.049473719	0.085375667G000014		G000015	0.023097034	0.085375667G000016	0.040172337	0.085375667G000017	0.066093983	0.085375667G000018	0.072967087	0.085375667G000019	-0.002616443	0.085375667G000020	0.054396002	0.085375667!sample_table_end
