Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454185/suppl/GSM454185_4622.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.184664081	0.120717947G000002	0.054602479	0.042040763G000003	0.007603828	0.042040763G000004	0.025186713	0.042040763G000005	0.022406544	0.042040763G000006	0.102513902	0.042040763G000007	0.082095391	0.042040763G000008	0.065511742	0.042040763G000009	0.153649324	0.042040763G000010	0.054512301	0.042040763G000011	0.062015072	0.042040763G000012	0.125866427	0.042040763G000013	0.085545171	0.042040763G000014		G000015	0.022197321	0.042040763G000016	0.08504909	0.042040763G000017	0.115721879	0.042040763G000018	0.009420196	0.042040763G000019	0.036986145	0.042040763G000020	0.056978258	0.042040763!sample_table_end
