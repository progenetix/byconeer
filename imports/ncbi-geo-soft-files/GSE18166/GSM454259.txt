Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454259/suppl/GSM454259_1488.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.135753133	0.084308927G000002	0.055541714	0.084308927G000003	0.061925846	0.084308927G000004	0.055885475	0.111338722G000005	0.025031317	0.111338722G000006	0.122081156	0.111338722G000007	0.108985879	0.111338722G000008	0.100723606	0.111338722G000009	0.193567975	0.111338722G000010	0.064746547	0.111338722G000011	0.116114391	0.111338722G000012	0.093837856	0.111338722G000013	0.111468665	0.111338722G000014		G000015	0.128879256	0.111338722G000016	0.065375348	0.111338722G000017	0.104537432	0.111338722G000018	0.047098459	0.111338722G000019	0.055845294	0.111338722G000020	0.133990275	0.111338722!sample_table_end
