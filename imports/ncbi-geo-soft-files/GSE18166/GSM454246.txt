Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454246/suppl/GSM454246_2994.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.338660291	0.085055746G000002	0.153700916	0.085055746G000003	0.236441746	0.085055746G000004	0.068782732	0.085055746G000005	0.119865908	0.085055746G000006	0.21819819	0.085055746G000007	0.193135937	0.085055746G000008	0.103521101	0.085055746G000009	0.268202512	0.085055746G000010	0.207289385	0.085055746G000011	0.193938415	0.085055746G000012	0.149717404	0.085055746G000013	0.0807397	0.085055746G000014		G000015	0.026415057	0.085055746G000016	0.064133698	0.085055746G000017	0.035627083	0.085055746G000018	0.094586304	0.085055746G000019	0.071464938	0.012770328G000020	0.06362382	0.012770328!sample_table_end
