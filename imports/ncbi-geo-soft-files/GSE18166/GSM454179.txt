Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454179/suppl/GSM454179_4653.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	-0.141033531	-0.001178917G000002	-0.010494299	-0.001178917G000003	-0.011294686	-0.001178917G000004	-0.024288495	-0.001178917G000005	-0.083318521	-0.001178917G000006	-0.001089881	-0.001178917G000007	-0.039712882	-0.001178917G000008	0.007940105	-0.001178917G000009	-0.032719234	-0.001178917G000010	-0.03748127	-0.001178917G000011	-0.010857913	-0.001178917G000012	-0.001163425	-0.001178917G000013	-0.098741802	-0.001178917G000014		G000015	-0.028136916	-0.001178917G000016	-0.043089768	-0.001178917G000017	0.008838868	-0.001178917G000018	-0.010391585	-0.001178917G000019	-0.034374421	-0.001178917G000020	0.030397198	-0.001178917!sample_table_end
