Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454216/suppl/GSM454216_1483.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.195192402	0.163581571G000002	0.066193025	0.134232745G000003	0.13062727	0.134232745G000004	0.10739554	0.134232745G000005	-0.057408454	0.134232745G000006	0.18469258	0.134232745G000007	0.160262419	0.134232745G000008	0.048486621	0.134232745G000009	0.106733117	0.134232745G000010	0.119108983	0.134232745G000011	0.094077249	0.134232745G000012	0.272786844	0.134232745G000013	0.064439388	0.134232745G000014		G000015	-0.431300528	-0.366663331G000016	-0.483917986	-0.366663331G000017	-0.559456491	-0.366663331G000018	-0.445807695	-0.366663331G000019	-0.462694224	-0.366663331G000020	-0.424835751	-0.366663331!sample_table_end
