Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454265/suppl/GSM454265_1486.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	-0.18638976	-0.129061686G000002	-0.498661636	-0.430388969G000003	-0.417323775	-0.418883078G000004	-0.097875846	-0.046084955G000005	-0.001314984	0.044415927G000006	0.102886545	0.044415927G000007	0.005582938	0.044415927G000008	0.004665654	0.044415927G000009	0.067070467	0.044415927G000010	0.043405945	0.044415927G000011	0.013144292	0.044415927G000012	0.020499066	0.044415927G000013	0.021843828	0.044415927G000014		G000015	0.00062233	0.044415927G000016	-0.029152196	0.044415927G000017	0.018825849	0.044415927G000018	-0.033899423	0.044415927G000019	0.020453177	0.044415927G000020	0.017885393	0.044415927!sample_table_end
