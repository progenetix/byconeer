Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454107/suppl/GSM454107_1458.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.114671935	-0.0007802G000002	0.01977499	-0.0007802G000003	0.047903345	-0.0007802G000004	0.015452777	-0.0007802G000005	-0.191259864	-0.0007802G000006	0.007149178	-0.0007802G000007	0.072778322	-0.0007802G000008	0.003788473	-0.0007802G000009	-0.020305115	-0.0007802G000010	0.001354368	-0.0007802G000011	-0.010546595	-0.0007802G000012	-0.04744528	-0.0007802G000013	0.004456261	-0.0007802G000014		G000015	0.008502456	-0.0007802G000016	-0.151273548	-0.0007802G000017	0.026604502	-0.0007802G000018	-0.035981415	-0.0007802G000019	0.006481804	-0.0007802G000020	0.005621086	-0.0007802!sample_table_end
