Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454085/suppl/GSM454085_1508.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.134829111	0.229956168G000002	-0.601142626	-0.611637124G000003	-1.712853937	-1.67773059G000004	0.019510827	0.066597775G000005	-0.255114659	-0.248088749G000006	0.062861964	0.021829013G000007	0.060988022	0.021829013G000008	0.032068137	0.021829013G000009	-0.488009028	-0.453185824G000010	-0.538588104	-0.453185824G000011	-0.565502449	-0.453185824G000012	-0.766279873	-0.658440087G000013	-0.00039481	0.025523728G000014		G000015	0.001531844	0.025523728G000016	-0.000794831	0.025523728G000017	0.038793995	0.025523728G000018	-0.048629351	0.025523728G000019	-0.003587483	0.025523728G000020	-0.643568358	0.025523728!sample_table_end
