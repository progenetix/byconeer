Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned at 5 Âµm resolution in a two-color Agilent Scanner G25505B (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with automatically adjusted PMT voltages according to manufacturerâs specification. Array raw data were generated from scanned images using Axon GenePixPro Software (v6.1.0.2)!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot replicates were averaged. Spots not recognized by the image analysis software, or not passing the quality criteria were excluded from the calculations. Raw fluorescence intensities were normalized applying the printtip loess normalization function of limma.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9189!Sample_contact_name = Grischa,,Toedt!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics (B060)!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454088/suppl/GSM454088_1498.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18166!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = ID column of the reference platform#VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#SMOOTHED = value after segmentation and state assignment!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SMOOTHEDG000001	0.1232816	0.042426544G000002	0.069746043	0.042426544G000003	0.080843261	0.042426544G000004	-0.014639992	0.042426544G000005	-0.017595327	0.042426544G000006	0.061092197	0.042426544G000007	0.006939404	0.042426544G000008	-0.013163407	0.042426544G000009	0.096239493	0.042426544G000010	0.077751682	0.042426544G000011	0.069050869	0.042426544G000012	0.011257384	0.042426544G000013	0.040083405	0.042426544G000014		G000015	-0.008879586	0.042426544G000016	0.015204991	0.042426544G000017	0.053079037	0.042426544G000018	0.026527318	0.042426544G000019	-0.022195888	0.042426544G000020	0.035779794	0.042426544!sample_table_end
