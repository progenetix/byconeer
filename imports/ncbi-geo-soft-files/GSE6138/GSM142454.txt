RNA from these specimens was prepared using TRIzols reagent (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) according to the manufacturerâs guidelines with the additional step of a second chloroform extraction before precipitation. RNA from normal prostate and other normal human tissues were obtained from BD Biosciences (Oxford, UK), Ambion (Huntingdon, UK) and Stratagene (La Jolla, CA, USA).!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = For CGH experiments, labeled DNA was generated using a Bioprime labeling kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerâs instructions, except that 2 ug of DNA was labeled in a 50 ul reaction with 60 uM Cy5-dCTP (or Cy3-dCTP) [NEN, Boston, MA], plus 60 uM dCTP, and 120 uM dGTP, dATP, dTTP. Total cellular RNA (8 ug) was reverse transcribed overnight at 37Â°C with 1,200 units Superscript II (Invitrogen) in 40 ul of reaction buffer supplemented with 500 uM dGTP, dATP, and dTTP, 200 uM dCTP, 100 uM DTT, 100 uM Cy5- or Cy3-labeled dCTP, and 100uM excess random primer (5'-IIINNNNNN-3', where I is inosine). Labeling reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA (pH 8.0) to 90 mM. Cot-1 DNA (25 ug; Invitrogen) was added and unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a Sephadex ProbeQuant G-50 column (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, UK). Samples were heated to 70Â°C for 10 min in 80 mM NaOH, then neutralised by addition of HCl to 80 mM. A 400 ul aliquot of 0.5x SSPE (Sigma) was added and the sample was filtered through a 0.1 uM ultra free-MC filter column (Millipore Ltd., Watford, UK). The volume was then reduced to 30 ul using a Microcon YM-30 filtration unit (Millipore).!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Male Genomic DNA(Male Genomic DNA)!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: male!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue type: normal!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = DNA from these specimens was prepared using standard methods ie. cell lysis, proteinase K digestion, phenol extraction followed by precipitation (Sambrook and Russell,2001).

The volume was then reduced to 30 ul using a Microcon YM-30 filtration unit (Millipore).!Sample_hyb_protocol = The microarray grids were denatured by submerging in 70% (v/v) deionised formamide/2x SSC (pH 7) at 65Â°C for 1 min. Slides were then washed sequentially with 70%, 80%, and 100% (v/v) ethanol, blow-dried with canned air (RS Components, Corby, UK), and prewarmed to 37Â°C in a hybridisation chamber (BDH Precision Engineers, Cambridge, UK) for 30-60 min. Labeled samples (made from 1.5 ug of genomic DNA or 2.5 ug of total RNA) in 40 ul of hybridisation mix (0.1%, v/v) Tween 20, 6x SSPE (pH 7.4), and 12.5 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) were heated to 99Â°C for 2 min, 65Â°C for 10 min, and 37Â°C for 10 min; pipetted onto a microarray slide; and covered with a Hybrislip (22 x 60 mm; Sigma). A 150 ul aliquot of 0.5x SSPE was pipetted underneath the slide, and the hybridisation chamber was sealed and incubated at 65Â°C overnight. The slides were soaked in 2x SSC at 32Â°C until the coverslip detached, and then washed with 2x SSC 32Â°C for 2 min, 1x SSC/50 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) at RT for 1 min, and 0.05x SSC at RT for 1 min. Excess wash solution was removed with canned air.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridised microarray slides were scanned in a GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Slides were scanned at PMT (photomultiplier tube) voltage levels that provided an average Cy5:Cy3 hybridisation ratio across the slide of 1.0. Fluorescence intensity ratios (I = Cy5:Cy3) for individual cDNAs were then determined after subtraction of background using the GenePix Pro 3.0 software (Axon Instruments).!Sample_description = Slides were pre-hybed at 65C overnight, then washed and dried. Labelled samples were hybridised overnight at 65C.!Sample_data_processing = Data were filtered for quality by automated spot flagging and manual inspection in GenePix software and the normalised using a lowess algorithm.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3898!Sample_contact_name = Ian,,Giddings!Sample_contact_email = ian.giddings@icr.ac.uk, daniel.brewer@icr.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = +44 20 8722 4293!Sample_contact_fax = +44 20 8722 4141!Sample_contact_laboratory = CANCER RESEARCH UK DNA Microarray Facility!Sample_contact_department = Section of Molecular Carcinogenesis!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Cancer Research!Sample_contact_address = 15 Cotswold Road!Sample_contact_city = Sutton!Sample_contact_state = Surrey!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SM2 5NG!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.crukdmf.icr.ac.uk!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE6138!Sample_data_row_count = 5603
