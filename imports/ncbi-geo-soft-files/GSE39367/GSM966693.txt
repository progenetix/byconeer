Collect the saved flow-through from RNA extract with Qiagenâs  RNeasy kit, add 100% EtOH âabout 1/3 volume of flow through, mix well and freeze at -20C for 1-2 hours.  2. Spin for 15â at 10,000 RPM in cold room. Discard the supernatant and re-suspend pellet in ATL buffer from Qiagenâs  QiaAMP DNA mini kit, proceed following the manufactoryâs protocol.  3. DNA quantity was measured with nano-drop and DNA quality was checked by running agarose gel.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Labeling was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions in the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Nsp/Sty 6.0 User Guide.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Method 2, as outlined in the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Nsp/Sty 6.0 User Guide, with the following changes:  A Bio-Rad DNA Engine PCR machine is used in the specified thermal cycler program.  Four samples are loaded onto four arrays, the septa is covered with tough spots, and the arrays are placed into the hybridization oven.  This is continued in four-array blocks until all of the arrays are loaded in the oven.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, then scanned with an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G Plus with Autoloader.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP6!Sample_data_processing = CEL files were processed using the 'aroma R package, and log_2 copy numbers were produced using a reference of pooled normal samples.  Missing values were imputed using the nearest non-missing value.  Segmentation was performed using the DNAcopy R package.  The resulting copy number profiles were median centered and smoothed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vonn,,Walter!Sample_contact_email = vwalter@email.unc.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 919 323-5579!Sample_contact_laboratory = Neil Hayes Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = CB#7295, School of Medicine!Sample_contact_city = Chapel Hill!Sample_contact_state = NC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 27599-7295!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM966nnn/GSM966693/suppl/GSM966693_HN041.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE39367!Sample_series_id = GSE39368!Sample_data_row_count = 1781657#ID_REF = #VALUE = log_2 ratios, where the ratio has the form (tumor DNA copy number)/(normal DNA copy number).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUECN_473963	0.0846937CN_473964	0.0846937CN_473965	0.0846937CN_477984	0.0846937CN_473981	0.0846937CN_473982	0.0846937CN_497980	0.0846937CN_497981	0.0846937CN_513369	0.0846937CN_513370	0.0846937CN_517762	0.0846937CN_517763	0.0846937CN_502615	0.0846937CN_502613	0.0846937CN_502614	0.0846937CN_502616	0.0846937CN_502842	0.0846937CN_502843	0.0846937CN_466171	0.0846937CN_466172	0.0846937!sample_table_end
