If desired, combine partial bags of male blood into one bag. If reference DNA from a!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = single donor is desired keep individual bags separate. Repeat with female blood and place!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = back into refrigerator. The following steps should be performed on only male blood until!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = complete, then with female blood to prevent inadvertent cross-contamination.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 2. Place approximately 50 mL aliquots of the male blood into clean 50 mL tubes.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 3. Centrifuge the blood at 4,000 rpm at 4Â°C for 10 minutes.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 4. The blood will separate into serum and solids. Aspirate off and discard the top layer of!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = serum.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 5. Using a 10 mL serological pipet, remove the top 1/4-inch of red blood cells from the!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = remaining dark brown blood and place this into new 50 mL centrifuge tubes. This layer!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = is called the buffy coat and this is where most white blood cells will be found. Discard!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = the remaining red blood cells. Combine the buffy coats from 2-3 tubes to a volume of!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = approximately 10 mL.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 6. Combine the approximately 10 mL of red and white blood cell mix with 3-5 volumes!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = (fill the 50 mL tube to the top with Lysis Buffer) of Erythrocyte Lysis Buffer preheated!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = to 37 Â°C. This should lyse the red blood cells and hopefully not the white blood cells.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Incubate for 5 minutes at 37Â°C.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 7. Centrifuge the lysate for 10 minutes at 4,000 rpm at 4Â°C.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 8. Remove all but 4-5 mL of the supernatant above the loose dark brown pellet that!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = contains the white blood cells.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Page 3 of 4!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 9. Add 25 mL of the wash solution (NaCl and EDTA) and resuspend the pellet by!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = vigorously shaking with the lid on tight. Centrifuge again at 4,000 rpm and 4Â°C for 10!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = minutes. Aspirate off all but 4-5 mL of wash solution above the pellet.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 10. Repeat step 9. Repeat the wash step until the pellet has turned white.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 11. Resuspend the pellet in 10 mL of Nuclei Lysis Buffer. Be sure the pellet is broken up!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = so that the SDS and Protease K can get to the cells.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 12. Add 330 Î¼L of 20% SDS solution and 500 Î¼g of Protease K (resuspended at 20 ug/uL!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = for a total of 25 uL) and vortex to mix well. The combination of nuclei lysis buffer!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = and SDS and Protease K should lyse the outer cell membrane and the internal nuclear!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = membrane and free the white blood cell DNA to solution.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 13. Incubate at 37Â°C overnight or until the solution is clear.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 14. Add 3.3 mL of supersaturated NaCl (6 M) to the clear solution. Vortex for 15!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = seconds. This âsalting outâ step precipitates proteins and leaves DNA in solution.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 15. Centrifuge at 4,000 rpm at 4Â°C for 10 minutes. Transfer supernatant to a new 50 mL!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = tube. The supernatant may look like an opaque, viscous blob (like snot) with a!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = yellowish tinge at the bottom. It can be hard to work with.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 16. Add 25 mL x 100% EtOH to the tube and invert the tube several times to mix well.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = The DNA should readily precipitate out from solution and float to the surface, if it!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = hasnât already done so.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 17. Spool the floating DNA blob into a new 1.5 mL Centrifuge tube. Fill the tube with!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 70% EtOH and vortex for 1 minute.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 18. Let stand for 15 minutes. Pour out EtOH and wipe excess EtOH out of the tube with a!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = rolled chem-wipe.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 19. Air dry the DNA for 10 - 20 minutes to insure all excess EtOH has evaporated.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 20. Resuspend the pellet in dH2O. (see note 1.)!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 21. Using a 1000 Î¼L pipet followed by a 200 Î¼L pipet, pipet the liquid up and down to!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = shear the DNA and to make the solutions less viscous.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 22. Using a Fluorometer, determine DNA concentration. Aliquot DNA into new 1.5 mL!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = tubes and dilute to a concentration of 600 ng/ Î¼L (0.6 Î¼g/ Î¼L). Label and store!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = aliquots at -20Â°C.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 3.0 Notes!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 1. Tris/EDTA is sometimes used to resuspend the DNA. It may take an hour or two to!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = fully resuspend the DNA.!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = The tumor genomic DNA and normal female reference DNA (300 ng each) were labeled by random priming in separate 50 ï­l reactions to incorporate Cy3 and Cy5, respectively.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The test and reference DNAs together with 100 ï­g human Cot-1 DNA were hybridized to the BAC arrays for ~48 hrs at 37ï°C.  After post-hybridization washes, the arrays were mounted in a solution containing 90% glycerol, 10% PBS and 1 ï­M DAPI and sealed with a cover slip. !Sample_scan_protocol = A custom built CCD camera system was used to acquire 16 bit 1024x1024 pixel DAPI, Cy3 and Cy5 images (Pinkel et al., 1998).  Image analysis was carried out using UCSF SPOT software (Jain et al., 2002).  !Sample_description = Fallopian tube carcinoma (FTC) is a rare, poorly studied and aggressive cancer, associated with poor survival.  Since tumorigenesis is related to acquisition of genetic changes, we used genome-wide array CGH to analyze copy number aberrations occurring in FTC in order to obtain a better understanding of FTC carcinogenesis and to identify prognostic events and targets for therapy.  We used arrays of 2464 genomic clones, providing ~1.4 Mb resolution across the genome to quantitatively map genomic DNA copy number aberrations from fourteen FTC onto the human genome sequence. !Sample_data_processing = The log2ratio of the total integrated Cy3 and Cy5 intensities for each spot after background subtraction was calculated, normalized to the median log2ratio of all the clones on the array and the average of the triplicates calculated using a second custom program, SPROC.  Automatic data filtering to reject data points based on low DAPI intensity, low correlation between Cy3 and Cy5 within each segmented spot and low reference/DAPI signal intensity was also carried out using SPROC.  Data files were subsequently manually edited by rejecting clones for which only one spot of the triplicate survived after SPROC analysis and for which the standard deviation of the log2ratio of the triplicate was >0.2.   For each tumor, the data are plotted as the mean log2ratio of the triplicate spots for each clone normalized to the genome median log2ratio.  The clones are ordered by position in the genome (UCSC draft genome sequence, August 2001 freeze) beginning at 1p and ending with Xq. !Sample_platform_id = GPL4896!Sample_contact_name = Antoine,,Snijders!Sample_contact_email = snijders@cc.ucsf.edu!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research Institute!Sample_contact_institute = University of California San Francisco!Sample_contact_address = 2340 Sutter Street!Sample_contact_city = San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM172nnn/GSM172360/suppl/GSM172360.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE7180!Sample_series_id = GSE12040!Sample_data_row_count = 2464#ID_REF = #VALUE = T10112!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEHumArray2H11_N30	HumArray2H11_C9	0.548629HumArray2H10_N30	0.648384HumArray2H10_B18	0.290115HumArray2H10_Q30	0.769523HumArray2H10_T30	0.644485HumArray2H10_B19	0.457736HumArray2H10_W30	0.694729HumArray2H9_C14	0.476377HumArray2H9_F14	0.054032HumArray2H9_I14	0.252055HumArray2H9_A23	0.361015HumArray2H9_L14	-0.030694HumArray2H9_O14	-0.073055HumArray2H11_L8	0.300033HumArray2H9_B4	0.069466HumArray2H10_E19	0.182954HumArray2H9_U14	-0.018294HumArray2H9_R14	0.1988HumArray2H9_C17	0.187182!sample_table_end
