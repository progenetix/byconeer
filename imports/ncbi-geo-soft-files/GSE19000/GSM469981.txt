Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics).!Sample_scan_protocol = Slides were scanned at 10 Âµm resolution using an Agilent scanner (G2565BA). PMT settings: 100/100!Sample_description = Array CGH analysis of a female patient with SÃ©zary syndrome.!Sample_data_processing = TIFF images were analysed by Genepix 5.0 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and raw intensities (gpr files) were imported into CGHPRO (Chen at al.,2005). Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.2 and -0.2, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM469nnn/GSM469981/suppl/GSM469981.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19000!Sample_series_id = GSE21731!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (test/reference) (subgrid lowess)#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	0.187	1154	193	838	57	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	204	193	66	53	-501_1_3_397B22	-0.029	1607	192	994	53	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	247	201	125	55	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	248	201	108	55	01_1_6_F0488J12	-0.01	2599	200	1692	54	01_1_7_N0413M21	-0.467	950	200	412	55	01_1_8_D2542F24	-0.258	1555	196	816	55	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.561	680	193	604	54	01_1_10_N0673B19	0.024	986	189	628	52	01_1_11_N0090E12(del)	0.052	584	190	334	51	01_1_12_N0097G03	-0.003	2250	194	1487	53	01_1_13_N1030C19	0.044	1689	198	1114	54	01_1_14_N0345M21	0.047	655	196	387	52	01_1_15_N0281A03	0.244	1915	197	1494	53	01_1_16_N0771D21	0.011	2422	194	1610	52	01_1_17_N0504D21	0.189	1111	198	810	51	01_1_18_N0490A23	-0.148	2885	201	1696	52	01_1_19_M2112G04	0.252	614	203	419	53	01_1_20_N0282F14	-0.164	1448	197	814	52	0!sample_table_end
