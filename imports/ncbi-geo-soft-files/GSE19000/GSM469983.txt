PMT settings: 100/100!Sample_description = Array CGH analysis of a female patient with SÃ©zary syndrome.!Sample_data_processing = TIFF images were analysed by Genepix 5.0 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and raw intensities (gpr files) were imported into CGHPRO (Chen at al.,2005). Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.2 and -0.2, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM469nnn/GSM469983/suppl/GSM469983.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19000!Sample_series_id = GSE21731!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (test/reference) (subgrid lowess)#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	0.213	1825	179	950	54	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	228	180	91	53	01_1_3_397B22	-0.247	2976	181	1140	53	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	369	188	161	58	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	819	190	320	63	01_1_6_F0488J12	-0.142	5343	191	2222	63	01_1_7_N0413M21	null	2220	190	958	66	-1001_1_8_D2542F24	null	2539	188	994	65	-1001_1_9_N0137H06	0.152	1145	190	545	57	01_1_10_N0673B19	0.124	3893	187	1944	55	01_1_11_N0090E12(del)	-0.294	1522	190	539	57	01_1_12_N0097G03	0.018	4142	191	1920	55	01_1_13_N1030C19	-0.046	2482	184	1079	53	01_1_14_N0345M21	0.089	2882	185	1403	54	01_1_15_N0281A03	0.191	3329	188	1752	60	01_1_16_N0771D21	0.039	4183	191	1967	58	01_1_17_N0504D21	0.214	1788	202	931	59	01_1_18_N0490A23	null	3708	219	1792	66	-1001_1_19_M2112G04	0.01	1920	214	868	66	01_1_20_N0282F14	null	1729	252	899	80	-100!sample_table_end
