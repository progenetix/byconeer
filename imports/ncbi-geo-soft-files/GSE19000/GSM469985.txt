Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics).!Sample_scan_protocol = Slides were scanned at 10 Âµm resolution using an Agilent scanner (G2565BA). PMT settings: 100/100!Sample_description = Array CGH analysis of a female patient with SÃ©zary syndrome.!Sample_data_processing = TIFF images were analysed by Genepix 5.0 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and raw intensities (gpr files) were imported into CGHPRO (Chen at al.,2005). Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.2 and -0.2, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM469nnn/GSM469985/suppl/GSM469985.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19000!Sample_series_id = GSE21731!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (test/reference) (subgrid lowess)#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	null	1994	304	894	105	-501_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	251	198	109	58	01_1_3_397B22	-0.03	2880	195	1279	55	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	490	195	207	55	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	767	197	188	56	01_1_6_F0488J12	-0.085	4567	202	1970	56	01_1_7_N0413M21	-0.159	1289	198	500	54	01_1_8_D2542F24	-0.01	2494	195	1104	54	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.504	1178	197	731	54	01_1_10_N0673B19	0.064	1670	199	775	56	01_1_11_N0090E12(del)	-0.045	970	200	398	57	01_1_12_N0097G03	0.033	3737	199	1746	53	01_1_13_N1030C19	0.074	2559	197	1210	52	01_1_14_N0345M21	0.096	1123	196	518	51	01_1_15_N0281A03	0.193	2976	197	1554	50	01_1_16_N0771D21	-0.093	4223	200	1811	50	01_1_17_N0504D21	0.183	1980	201	1000	51	01_1_18_N0490A23	0.427	4163	201	2558	53	01_1_19_M2112G04	null	1125	205	525	56	-1001_1_20_N0282F14	-0.001	2151	206	956	55	0!sample_table_end
