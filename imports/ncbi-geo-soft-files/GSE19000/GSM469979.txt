Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics).!Sample_scan_protocol = Slides were scanned at 10 Âµm resolution using an Agilent scanner (G2565BA). PMT settings: 100/100!Sample_description = Array CGH analysis of a male patient with SÃ©zary syndrome.!Sample_data_processing = TIFF images were analysed by Genepix 5.0 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and raw intensities (gpr files) were imported into CGHPRO (Chen at al.,2005). Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.2 and -0.2, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM469nnn/GSM469979/suppl/GSM469979.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19000!Sample_series_id = GSE21731!Sample_series_id = GSE63013!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (test/reference) (subgrid lowess)#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	0.101	2256	234	1443	66	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	283	238	114	66	01_1_3_397B22	-0.218	5846	243	3050	68	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	600	230	329	66	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	281	234	130	67	01_1_6_F0488J12	-0.058	12584	231	7231	65	01_1_7_N0413M21	-0.249	1560	235	755	64	01_1_8_D2542F24	0.066	2314	234	1444	63	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.146	2034	244	1338	68	01_1_10_N0673B19	null	255	244	72	68	-501_1_11_N0090E12(del)	0.021	2134	247	1288	71	01_1_12_N0097G03	0.091	8662	250	5646	69	01_1_13_N1030C19	-0.369	4296	239	2047	67	01_1_14_N0345M21	0.058	2050	243	1267	67	01_1_15_N0281A03	-0.142	5347	252	2955	69	01_1_16_N0771D21	-0.135	6557	246	3613	70	01_1_17_N0504D21	0.104	2888	261	1861	72	01_1_18_N0490A23	-0.479	20906	277	8696	74	01_1_19_M2112G04	0.044	1434	258	852	69	01_1_20_N0282F14	-0.059	6533	249	3801	68	0!sample_table_end
