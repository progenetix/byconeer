PMT settings: 100/100!Sample_description = Array CGH analysis of a male patient with SÃ©zary syndrome.!Sample_data_processing = TIFF images were analysed by Genepix 5.0 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and raw intensities (gpr files) were imported into CGHPRO (Chen at al.,2005). Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.2 and -0.2, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM469nnn/GSM469986/suppl/GSM469986.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19000!Sample_series_id = GSE21731!Sample_series_id = GSE63013!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (test/reference) (subgrid lowess)#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	-0.141	2671	325	1095	128	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	332	327	149	138	01_1_3_397B22	0.026	5200	326	2382	139	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	1551	322	349	137	-1001_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	5863	326	225	144	01_1_6_F0488J12	0.108	7154	346	3468	167	01_1_7_N0413M21	-0.065	2136	350	907	172	01_1_8_D2542F24	-0.085	2129	334	890	155	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.091	1932	336	908	157	01_1_10_N0673B19	null	330	338	155	156	-501_1_11_N0090E12(del)	0.166	1621	344	788	156	01_1_12_N0097G03	0.477	6408	367	4012	180	01_1_13_N1030C19	-0.044	4886	356	2133	165	01_1_14_N0345M21	0.096	2073	344	988	161	01_1_15_N0281A03	-0.014	4584	344	2046	160	01_1_16_N0771D21	0.028	6484	341	2982	165	01_1_17_N0504D21	0.075	2857	340	1366	158	01_1_18_N0490A23	0.148	17024	359	8619	160	01_1_19_M2112G04	-0.123	2002	360	807	169	01_1_20_N0282F14	0.012	5511	345	2502	162	0!sample_table_end
