PMT settings: 100/100!Sample_description = Array CGH analysis of a male patient with SÃ©zary syndrome.!Sample_data_processing = TIFF images were analysed by Genepix 5.0 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and raw intensities (gpr files) were imported into CGHPRO (Chen at al.,2005). Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.2 and -0.2, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM470nnn/GSM470382/suppl/GSM470382.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19000!Sample_series_id = GSE21731!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (test/reference) (subgrid lowess)#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	-0.008	2030	262	665	60	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	386	268	114	67	01_1_3_397B22	0.024	3442	271	1176	68	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	629	273	205	64	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	493	274	158	62	01_1_6_F0488J12	-0.028	8517	275	2875	62	01_1_7_N0413M21	0.049	2375	268	812	63	01_1_8_D2542F24	0	3516	269	1183	64	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.016	1786	271	593	65	01_1_10_N0673B19	null	281	269	65	64	-501_1_11_N0090E12(del)	-0.051	944	270	291	63	01_1_12_N0097G03	0.105	5514	271	2043	64	01_1_13_N1030C19	-0.054	5673	269	1880	65	01_1_14_N0345M21	-0.173	323	278	85	63	01_1_15_N0281A03	0.018	5350	272	1862	63	01_1_16_N0771D21	-0.015	5496	276	1871	63	01_1_17_N0504D21	0.014	3514	276	1194	62	01_1_18_N0490A23	-0.104	8293	279	2655	62	01_1_19_M2112G04	0.019	1445	281	477	63	01_1_20_N0282F14	0.018	3601	281	1228	64	0!sample_table_end
