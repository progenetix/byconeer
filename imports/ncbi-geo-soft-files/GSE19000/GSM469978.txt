PMT settings: 100/100.!Sample_description = Array CGH analysis of a male patient with SÃ©zary syndrome.!Sample_data_processing = TIFF images were analysed by Genepix 5.0 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and raw intensities (gpr files) were imported into CGHPRO (Chen at al.,2005). Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.2 and -0.2, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM469nnn/GSM469978/suppl/GSM469978.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19000!Sample_series_id = GSE21731!Sample_series_id = GSE63013!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (test/reference) (subgrid lowess)#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	0.033	2858	310	944	122	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	318	298	111	105	-501_1_3_397B22	-0.094	7293	287	2174	103	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	823	290	370	100	-1001_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	409	314	171	121	-1001_1_6_F0488J12	-0.194	11331	296	3155	106	01_1_7_N0413M21	null	2243	306	573	112	-1001_1_8_D2542F24	0.019	2892	300	946	111	01_1_9_N0137H06	-0.002	2176	298	712	113	01_1_10_N0673B19	null	296	307	97	112	-501_1_11_N0090E12(del)	0.067	2135	306	733	115	01_1_12_N0097G03	-0.024	10044	315	3155	113	01_1_13_N1030C19	-0.165	5341	313	1539	107	01_1_14_N0345M21	0.092	3012	339	1033	124	01_1_15_N0281A03	0.023	7692	315	2480	105	01_1_16_N0771D21	-0.101	9884	292	2944	97	01_1_17_N0504D21	null	4013	291	1381	97	-1001_1_18_N0490A23	-0.034	28581	302	8221	111	01_1_19_M2112G04	0.068	2111	303	726	114	01_1_20_N0282F14	-0.119	8768	303	2572	105	0!sample_table_end
