PMT settings: 100/100!Sample_description = Array CGH analysis of a female patient with SÃ©zary syndrome!Sample_data_processing = TIFF images were analysed by Genepix 5.0 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and raw intensities (gpr files) were imported into CGHPRO (Chen at al.,2005). Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.2 and -0.2, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM470nnn/GSM470379/suppl/GSM470379.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19000!Sample_series_id = GSE21731!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (test/reference) (subgrid lowess)#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	0.048	2849	232	1410	99	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	326	233	156	98	01_1_3_397B22	-0.142	4224	229	1819	97	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	491	231	252	96	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	335	240	164	98	01_1_6_F0488J12	-0.077	5846	241	2630	103	01_1_7_N0413M21	0.038	1833	240	893	101	01_1_8_D2542F24	0.093	2687	236	1371	99	01_1_9_N0137H06	-0.021	1548	232	730	96	01_1_10_N0673B19	-0.401	7067	230	2536	96	01_1_11_N0090E12(del)	0.071	1036	227	521	97	01_1_12_N0097G03	-0.093	5929	229	2638	98	01_1_13_N1030C19	-0.138	3258	227	1419	97	01_1_14_N0345M21	-0.059	1774	225	810	100	01_1_15_N0281A03	0.095	4660	234	2381	104	01_1_16_N0771D21	-0.132	4494	229	1959	103	01_1_17_N0504D21	0.128	2510	225	1310	103	01_1_18_N0490A23	0.37	7503	230	4598	105	01_1_19_M2112G04	0.097	1226	228	630	106	01_1_20_N0282F14	-0.019	3804	226	1787	102	0!sample_table_end
