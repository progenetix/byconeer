Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.2 and -0.2, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM470nnn/GSM470380/suppl/GSM470380.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19000!Sample_series_id = GSE21731!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (test/reference) (subgrid lowess)#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	0.4	1356	180	1089	51	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	200	191	77	84	01_1_3_397B22	-0.11	1970	186	1144	63	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	272	189	136	53	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	249	185	118	57	01_1_6_F0488J12	-0.087	3059	184	1849	55	01_1_7_N0413M21	null	863	182	443	50	-1001_1_8_D2542F24	0.197	1736	183	1244	51	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.161	729	189	473	52	01_1_10_N0673B19	0.132	871	187	565	51	01_1_11_N0090E12(del)	0.146	658	182	416	51	01_1_12_N0097G03	0.081	2364	180	1617	50	01_1_13_N1030C19	0.123	1406	179	934	51	01_1_14_N0345M21	0.133	768	181	491	51	01_1_15_N0281A03	0.209	2500	183	1868	53	01_1_16_N0771D21	-0.124	2704	181	1605	53	01_1_17_N0504D21	-0.108	1090	179	609	50	01_1_18_N0490A23	0.206	2383	181	1779	49	01_1_19_M2112G04	-0.027	717	186	404	51	01_1_20_N0282F14	-0.043	1968	188	1203	53	0!sample_table_end
