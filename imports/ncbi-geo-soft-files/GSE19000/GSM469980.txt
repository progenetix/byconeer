Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics).!Sample_scan_protocol = Slides were scanned at 10 Âµm resolution using an Agilent scanner (G2565BA). PMT settings: 100/100!Sample_description = Array CGH analysis of a female patient with SÃ©zary syndrome.!Sample_data_processing = TIFF images were analysed by Genepix 5.0 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and raw intensities (gpr files) were imported into CGHPRO (Chen at al.,2005). Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.2 and -0.2, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM469nnn/GSM469980/suppl/GSM469980.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19000!Sample_series_id = GSE21731!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (test/reference) (subgrid lowess)#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	0.1	1956	189	927	57	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	245	192	92	56	01_1_3_397B22	-0.217	2844	192	1083	57	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	496	193	197	58	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	834	193	255	57	01_1_6_F0488J12	-0.104	4316	195	1775	58	01_1_7_N0413M21	-0.061	1374	194	576	55	01_1_8_D2542F24	0.108	2470	196	1177	58	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.065	1138	196	514	58	01_1_10_N0673B19	-0.074	1894	199	800	62	01_1_11_N0090E12(del)	-0.201	1012	200	370	58	01_1_12_N0097G03	-0.077	3927	262	1655	87	01_1_13_N1030C19	null	3418	254	1428	82	-1001_1_14_N0345M21	-0.023	1129	201	478	56	01_1_15_N0281A03	0.185	2840	205	1434	57	01_1_16_N0771D21	-0.025	4814	207	2071	61	01_1_17_N0504D21	0.186	2073	209	1038	61	01_1_18_N0490A23	0.236	3964	205	2059	57	01_1_19_M2112G04	0.025	1128	204	495	58	01_1_20_N0282F14	0.1	2477	203	1174	58	0!sample_table_end
