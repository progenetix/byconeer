PMT settings: 100/100!Sample_description = Array CGH analysis of a male patient with SÃ©zary syndrome!Sample_data_processing = TIFF images were analysed by Genepix 5.0 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and raw intensities (gpr files) were imported into CGHPRO (Chen at al.,2005). Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.2 and -0.2, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM470nnn/GSM470381/suppl/GSM470381.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19000!Sample_series_id = GSE21731!Sample_series_id = GSE63013!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (test/reference) (subgrid lowess)#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	0.02	2744	260	1152	82	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	386	263	145	82	01_1_3_397B22	-0.049	4142	268	1670	83	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	560	269	261	84	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	409	266	178	83	01_1_6_F0488J12	-0.119	6346	266	2429	85	01_1_7_N0413M21	-0.257	2387	267	826	85	01_1_8_D2542F24	0.018	3147	262	1319	84	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.114	1848	264	823	84	01_1_10_N0673B19	0.234	9827	270	5042	88	01_1_11_N0090E12(del)	-0.076	1038	269	412	90	01_1_12_N0097G03	-0.087	7172	261	2850	86	01_1_13_N1030C19	-0.106	3476	265	1338	87	01_1_14_N0345M21	-0.051	2372	263	948	86	01_1_15_N0281A03	-0.023	6550	267	2697	86	01_1_16_N0771D21	-0.001	5695	272	2352	88	01_1_17_N0504D21	-0.042	3413	264	1374	87	01_1_18_N0490A23	-0.285	12087	259	4334	85	01_1_19_M2112G04	0.061	1358	263	586	84	01_1_20_N0282F14	0.01	4249	265	1782	86	0!sample_table_end
