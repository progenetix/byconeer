Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics).!Sample_scan_protocol = Slides were scanned at 10 um resolution using an Agilent scanner (G2565BA). PMT settings: 100/100!Sample_description = Array CGH analysis of a female patient with SÃ©zary syndrome.!Sample_data_processing = TIFF images were analysed by Genepix 5.0 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and raw intensities (gpr files) were imported into CGHPRO (Chen at al.,2005).Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.2 and -0.2, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM469nnn/GSM469982/suppl/GSM469982.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19000!Sample_series_id = GSE21731!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (test/reference) (subgrid lowess)#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	0.09	1590	196	583	53	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	252	197	77	52	01_1_3_397B22	-0.378	2938	198	781	58	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	508	199	217	60	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	787	196	510	53	01_1_6_F0488J12	0.114	5694	201	2152	53	01_1_7_N0413M21	0.098	2066	198	763	51	01_1_8_D2542F24	-0.055	2247	194	746	51	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.198	1712	196	678	52	01_1_10_N0673B19	0.207	4267	196	1749	51	01_1_11_N0090E12(del)	-0.448	1517	222	382	61	01_1_12_N0097G03	-0.258	655	277	191	79	01_1_13_N1030C19	0.025	2668	218	939	59	01_1_14_N0345M21	0.162	2372	192	915	50	01_1_15_N0281A03	0.018	3600	196	1289	51	01_1_16_N0771D21	-0.067	5159	198	1718	52	01_1_17_N0504D21	-0.397	2543	195	666	50	01_1_18_N0490A23	0.436	4128	192	1965	51	01_1_19_M2112G04	-0.489	2487	190	612	51	01_1_20_N0282F14	0.296	2525	195	1074	51	0!sample_table_end
