Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.2 and -0.2, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM469nnn/GSM469977/suppl/GSM469977.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19000!Sample_series_id = GSE21731!Sample_series_id = GSE63013!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (test/reference) (subgrid lowess)#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	0.149	2446	299	1659	131	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	394	294	200	133	01_1_3_397B22	-0.707	6150	304	2334	134	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	862	298	520	134	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	410	291	221	136	01_1_6_F0488J12	-0.124	11741	289	6444	137	01_1_7_N0413M21	-0.295	2452	292	1221	136	01_1_8_D2542F24	0.043	4194	289	2657	134	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.049	2204	283	1393	136	01_1_10_N0673B19	null	284	287	129	137	-501_1_11_N0090E12(del)	-0.627	1709	285	680	136	01_1_12_N0097G03	-0.034	9207	290	5494	138	01_1_13_N1030C19	-0.201	5317	289	2870	139	01_1_14_N0345M21	-0.05	2945	291	1735	159	01_1_15_N0281A03	-0.055	6645	291	3911	156	01_1_16_N0771D21	-0.059	9547	289	5584	143	01_1_17_N0504D21	0.03	4194	298	2632	155	01_1_18_N0490A23	-0.292	19661	305	9219	154	01_1_19_M2112G04	-0.036	1991	291	1187	147	01_1_20_N0282F14	-0.241	9763	293	5055	150	0!sample_table_end
