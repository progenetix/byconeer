DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = pediatric B-ALL sample before treatment!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console Software (version 2.0.1). Processing of the raw signals and raw copy-number calculation were performed using the CRMAv2 procedure of the aroma.affymetrix package (version 2.0.0) for R Statistical platform (version 2.12.1) according to the aroma.affymetrix vignette for paired total copy-number analysis. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was then applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor to perform the segmentation. Affymetrix  "GenomeWideSNP_6.na30.annot.csv" annotation (Genome Build version hg18) was used.!Sample_data_processing = Primary data description: Smoothed copy-number signal ratios and detected segments and segment mean values. Genome Build version hg18 was used.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Thomas,,Streichert!Sample_contact_department = Institute For Clinical Chemistry / Central Laboratories!Sample_contact_institute = University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf!Sample_contact_address = Martinistr. 52, Campus Forschung N27, 2.
