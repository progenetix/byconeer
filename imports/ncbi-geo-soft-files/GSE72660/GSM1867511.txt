Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 3.0 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 5.0) softwares. DNA copy number analysis was performed in Nexus 6.0 Copy Number Analysis software (BioDiscovery, CA) using NCBI Build 36.1 (hg18).  The UPMC data was normalized to a baseline reference file created using DNA isolated from white blood cells from 15 individuals in the same patient population and the UM dataset was normalized to a reference file created using DNA from 72 matched normal squamous esophageal epithelium specimens.  The two datasets were independently pre-processed and the SNP-Rank Segmentation algorithm was used to segment the normalized data with a minimum requirement of 8 probe-sets and a significance threshold p-value of 10-6.  Log2 copy number thresholds for gains and losses were set at +0.15 (~2.2 copies) and -0.2 (~1.7 copies) respectively while high level gains and homozygous loss were set at +0.5 (~2.8 copies) and -0.8 (~1.1 copies) respectively for both datasets.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Tony,Edward,Godfrey!Sample_contact_email = godfreyt@bu.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6174148013!Sample_contact_laboratory = Godfrey!Sample_contact_department = Surgery!Sample_contact_institute = Boston University!Sample_contact_address = 700 Albany Street!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = Massachusetts!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02118!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867511/suppl/GSM1867511_Godfrey_1013A_2_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867511/suppl/GSM1867511_Godfrey_1013A_2_GenomeWideSNP_6_.SNP6_Run112309.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1867nnn/GSM1867511/suppl/GSM1867511_Godfrey_1013A_2_GenomeWideSNP_6_.SNP6_Run112309.CN5.CNCHP.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72660!Sample_data_row_count = 0
