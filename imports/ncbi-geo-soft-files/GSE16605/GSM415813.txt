DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415813/suppl/GSM415813_KC0205.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415813/suppl/GSM415813_KC0206.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16605!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1236.235231031052	1668.029596218126	1277.431837016292	1570.580159442342	1.496819415620236	1.904180936198348	.7860699512140903	-0.3204	.80084213487613522	404.518735895372	494.7580905877631	477.2364842688127	418.0234290479674	.6591344903683161	.5726290962366599	1.151067060161932	0.0407	1.0285800185561073	1242.911784879926	1505.084202312556	1277.218508110876	1407.580050373167	1.60724714728886	1.777625637913289	.904153896641347	-0.0985	.93402031222123024	4522.993251740174	5515.430191553742	4388.353819934038	5287.187275410114	4.862861041151006	5.554850317894756	.8754261164311611	-0.2880	.81905647105049775	3231.291065089013	2766.775879872976	3165.748822166842	2625.177271231468	4.57944057974645	3.895467764903524	1.175581690344154	0.1114	1.0803098066910416	5839.206628272756	6750.50203542069	5633.18356108913	6480.6604866569	8.137618923580307	9.784271504937646	.8317041201763101	-0.2101	.86447585008751737	622.2789281464006	797.3966707246425	686.5263329565067	724.8252460444618	.7831670845653178	.890758909386492	.8792133048713733	-0.1716	.88784456350017448	433.5662803286585	668.1697636026637	505.5729154066722	594.6484838626867	.6625788665576655	.76926121548254	.8613184354316432	-0.2487	.8416515308336079	2109.490108963707	3020.588983330148	2103.477904378549	2871.713038274014	2.850082816307884	3.931622720164406	.7249125918645376	-0.1116	.925545473195898610	9073.779019629723	10153.66407669527	8668.561618908101	9765.510585167895	11.42227907086086	12.59895260396668	.906605448080235	-0.1802	.882591273670512911	2957.849531279156	3316.912725679121	2905.185671194878	3157.358578259105	3.579557286544971	3.81021421129061	.9394635283071106	-0.0684	.953700554532959712	12545.83396747301	15145.57291352977	11887.50731698188	14498.37881310514	14.68920349269388	17.47217287556477	.8407199034321063	-0.1068	.928664829190851613	2284.331449536535	2771.917247246071	2267.528868464401	2631.345778467539	2.920263189436157	3.395535049513432	.8600303477517102	-0.0322	.977910080028637214	7202.597935318922	7552.483550348345	6921.131237620073	7264.712669032057	7.841941131381407	7.688272857088159	1.019987359599442	-0.0913	.93866215587542115	687.4207596013064	939.5203127074863	748.7837060133793	863.867203938666	.9586676152845798	1.123576139630998	.8532288836245875	-0.0692	.95317005422011116	1895.900878279523	1722.42993705279	1899.950660463058	1618.56787346034	2.308006843453281	2.077662586653828	1.110867018677192	0.0900	1.06436325485675317	249.6593822694524	326.265489120197	324.1729919017053	258.3647408136386	.5089593904217982	.4262508337685124	1.194037290020183	0.3070	1.23711695305742418	1759.455794468334	2668.705018901582	1770.23785828798	2533.662841160004	2.164524694068695	3.136776078117672	.6900475648129751	-0.3343	.793194677831817219	601.6672448334159	815.9033237390975	668.572494717766	741.3373443029128	.7844574751378173	.8374061206917943	.9367706489770634	-0.0565	.961578143934425620	1171.502188076757	1466.480290073318	1211.448106033953	1370.187813059667	1.603442823143569	1.847303578057216	.8679909692103168	-0.1968	.8725107406096783!sample_table_end
