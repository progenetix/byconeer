DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415818/suppl/GSM415818_KC0181.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415818/suppl/GSM415818_KC0182.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16605!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1749.269801346494	2959.20272151264	1887.4133091041	2707.400801908298	1.449199083111772	2.097351903024825	.6909661087496666	-0.3591	.77963038122485462	723.69110643722	683.684199639164	806.5157235764462	629.8865431352576	.6179985373966439	.4939723795472941	1.251079135159368	-0.0956	.9358813842977093	1066.152538170596	1648.96529159609	1168.500477356988	1510.248697163835	.8391489110738124	1.107631359566005	.7576066746634997	-0.1799	.8827435301268144	6206.071904207817	7661.761326659141	6292.259824258856	7013.076049159723	4.892807993175265	5.302828913221239	.922678832985976	-0.2284	.85357236267255595	5886.015455822785	5261.555092207427	5989.504220556184	4801.333860728897	4.226129028864749	3.397136036361858	1.244027022653675	0.2300	1.172834781970296	6576.890825382732	6570.756812353457	6644.33961860414	5993.708326061866	5.148693436653542	4.748801769420438	1.084208961891856	-0.0456	.96891138901214987	1775.448256779221	1991.407367637117	1915.588921253187	1822.432701933784	1.350821116360016	1.307670792859747	1.032997849103828	0.3064	1.2366341376818718	773.4780275706905	1036.009462095459	858.6910893543026	950.321017741795	.6590805064106257	.7329293905823677	.8992414752080503	-0.0646	.9562203480248969	1301.288599503932	1596.11217424096	1418.773907535894	1461.904236217237	.9823000634674643	1.000391292804666	.9819158468617996	0.0810	1.05772527375481710	8003.351181538761	8373.488797086073	7992.801904914255	7687.978899931135	5.573543544749269	5.329379742259133	1.045814675309032	0.1266	1.09174374505300311	3759.391946385296	5044.422567070083	3934.198607115479	4602.433558248849	2.722877247169837	3.238934519658096	.8406706682842312	-0.1978	.871901654609002212	16507.04168932126	21766.03865862452	16175.98843016754	21413.04817546093	12.31484095225222	16.05659680282567	.7669645755870904	0.0396	1.02781364582827813	1924.482845366434	2485.637235901008	2070.123814017492	2273.16399395556	1.530415396745665	1.664087638490278	.9196723545967298	-0.0387	.973504718023529414	6363.529582153257	6865.899788631759	6442.379560564415	6261.594365274744	4.768329912225904	4.476537983072232	1.065182498229004	0.0723	1.05140790598709115	1722.581398991191	1881.393719865696	1860.046323181311	1722.347035796376	1.311464565624974	1.247649419127364	1.051148299770175	0.2830	1.21672753449252216	2464.282196125492	2837.014619780541	2632.788164566076	2595.585761891875	1.921111179380588	1.878648361634139	1.022602855656027	0.0000	1.0000110269200817	318.4381930599058	419.5145997186562	374.2258172194531	389.077060474247	.2617899865895937	.2802590059423458	.9341001753337002	-0.0604	.95898546952549918	2795.07637049593	3758.994230747492	2968.420747621054	3435.985584804716	2.062035820057752	2.46936158059655	.8350481502022901	-0.1758	.885265730767521819	807.004072766523	929.3698082483955	894.0401969466195	852.5552082668684	.6581889882784334	.6111901353054479	1.076897270191538	0.0742	1.05274228130398520	899.7917764160437	1254.320212001145	992.5024231710456	1149.189484407595	.7411609787592742	.8668748047013535	.8549804132496516	-0.1429	.9057123888643506!sample_table_end
