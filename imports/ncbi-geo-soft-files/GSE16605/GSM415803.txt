DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415803/suppl/GSM415803_KC0185.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415803/suppl/GSM415803_KC0186.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16605!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2039.392878586273	2947.618147481506	2085.650786005666	2821.767961280457	1.51732825152268	2.094868844253624	.7243070398821487	-0.4513	.73138210343835372	554.3072479868398	639.19617533689	624.7215600099271	591.08758635959	.3999678905970348	.3792909042948714	1.054514848808736	-0.0755	.9489905654919663	1826.274816338548	2706.079021613996	1881.227719384646	2594.171179287452	1.208811754446336	1.619779671773358	.7462815934236982	-0.3065	.80857551683629814	5132.860813385554	4930.383165815958	5069.989746767042	4701.491467178521	4.535081445374725	4.184292227367082	1.08383477992128	0.0513	1.0362125536618215	9434.116671070482	6783.633890260852	9172.190448932792	6454.743785257259	6.156794808505428	4.109962549941978	1.498017252880404	0.1507	1.110098153166216	8664.698365781946	9678.490867994327	8439.555652793562	9174.042873026377	6.539008598883683	7.100575021288355	.9209125428967324	-0.1568	.89703056115276467	1691.467843884354	1983.212417121076	1746.83592909636	1899.599630653673	1.031291853696556	1.156987040569774	.8913599007891064	-0.0827	.94430068546874538	771.7027032759407	912.4317277640552	847.8252904534662	860.4708908282694	.6277741184816414	.6237932822544283	1.00638165934206	0.0506	1.035729061568959	2076.202236642972	2673.14933115533	2124.31200204061	2560.678311299	1.496936721522228	1.794030948114711	.8343984941259291	-0.0322	.977907457072922410	11141.16417390153	11424.0864699613	10782.49581467156	10842.39546532703	8.32829986467436	8.456022015184494	.9848957168890072	-0.0153	.989417559178670411	6459.77959668159	7228.550042475534	6328.369139321596	6854.307334917454	4.380969396468432	4.710939463594026	.9299566318617356	0.0147	1.01026089231511512	17972.34626666437	22471.6782524066	17110.80835739717	21514.56638086696	13.97580977253745	17.07268649127986	.8186063616687278	-0.0482	.967113288073094213	4104.973368351637	4325.123008621464	4087.204375105274	4126.110718170458	3.054828214336177	3.113993436470454	.9810002097495306	0.0665	1.04718482494390214	7554.703637286938	6966.694428135576	7384.095797598389	6622.299762131895	5.958062005238152	5.402907651073576	1.102751035186446	0.0217	1.01518142355858815	1003.458530369281	1235.664190365476	1096.770170831832	1166.744438434647	.7397435851696698	.7841745744850601	.9433404362229334	0.0151	1.01055334470609716	4017.404676531324	4513.862846858416	4004.408802192504	4312.276398963774	2.110967985455968	2.467240173658092	.8555989027716374	0.0232	1.01619122437943417	400.233866557451	471.6534777297024	471.917679065474	421.148071501646	.2254781388731791	.2114081823506656	1.066553509736797	0.0093	1.00647888219058818	3535.106071070419	4225.39146929651	3540.759779475668	4030.325268967994	2.438340422157635	2.760710292601482	.8832293735029799	-0.1059	.929212872231941219	1128.548557738845	1135.462849390664	1194.296377718081	1075.577486685993	1.049280993652175	.9443569691113832	1.111106316755965	0.1341	1.09739232764684320	2051.212436929401	2550.925362414972	2096.999888226081	2443.42330472438	1.227336564743057	1.404548128218333	.8738301949823049	-0.1933	.8746231124939439!sample_table_end
