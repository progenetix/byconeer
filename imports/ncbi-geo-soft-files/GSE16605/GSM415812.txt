DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415812/suppl/GSM415812_KC0201.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415812/suppl/GSM415812_KC0202.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16605!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1350.827037048328	1650.865546552808	1509.81235373615	1474.866949518988	1.007516421541076	.9658764526859158	1.04311107154478	-0.2096	.86479279784767342	538.3743593095328	550.7378630711379	634.1220353831405	494.4989236053777	.4307169661067733	.3282812503582085	1.312036449345769	-0.0121	.99162546528511223	2010.388628510712	3303.312202183365	2206.420328516083	2947.454077100533	1.47941896175097	1.832672767521258	.8072466552509137	-0.1838	.88035717077687144	11516.92268514434	13158.58795365323	11277.14628905491	11660.21170605642	8.232503341249469	8.009617140443137	1.027827322691982	0.0309	1.021616712723825	7114.740312332892	6278.171603274299	7333.886886109187	5615.151072913314	4.667884216623956	3.701455255341732	1.261094324965169	0.0679	1.0481820377980766	6031.215247759111	5864.368137821194	6279.387862159076	5242.764230723034	4.785740955075537	4.402076782941146	1.087155265810256	0.0765	1.0544754348085857	1444.487720771672	1830.268782398932	1610.079836086078	1634.740217735689	1.012524381509037	1.050276782825273	.964054807329282	0.1266	1.0916872631517548	897.3451900692054	1179.000938810802	1025.55197565479	1056.029555407755	.7089477570937983	.7770643030293062	.9123411721913328	-0.0704	.95238164055633569	1948.911297074334	3036.236322243865	2143.216759413134	2708.465108982749	1.37121993538517	1.823428379209706	.7520009839813241	-0.0759	.948769651265994610	9814.127693009106	12548.09472077646	9783.713718143208	11157.58176878331	6.870498663753041	7.45194798488965	.9219735131920384	-0.1084	.9276094098615511	3506.341623927476	4819.455031186271	3747.768704699224	4299.876545330934	2.590368554803313	2.888231357575321	.8968701721242771	-0.1264	.916101487579562812	27820.54237542984	34220.82626292574	23747.56711188228	29489.26753899286	16.93334892208821	19.53896659914576	.8666450621205599	-0.1392	.907993842242131613	3154.546576579487	4185.532487978041	3389.938234720114	3733.951106786084	2.377322870687844	2.507185895239066	.9482036713760152	-0.0597	.959469450913024414	7130.280709665553	6445.27680830081	7342.237393562571	5761.255803356455	4.926063404308348	3.839940952787912	1.282848737747356	0.1731	1.12751191076331415	1414.347890394911	1848.439205604613	1576.291416149065	1649.752225431814	1.126788133776016	1.197433365429058	.9410027867164632	0.1612	1.11824713852605216	2559.331579407364	3450.056410006226	2779.258015106771	3076.604641179074	1.837884920999982	2.23013580777948	.8241134529066831	-0.0253	.982598719959525417	195.9891476996368	299.8489970658588	253.982150124453	249.1148553993388	.1572610522369312	.201558068446129	.7802270256373425	0.2172	1.16245784653301218	3517.853043638416	4923.631841290165	3760.122970054731	4396.890218538095	2.504543574565218	3.005235358056496	.8333934870861235	-0.2500	.840889047049769619	1139.961880529637	1506.387150543224	1284.485897156535	1347.780477845866	.9287355455938752	.932170803002875	.996314776864998	-0.0489	.966655757092891420	1523.753513370128	2580.619535261335	1692.960049975752	2299.921221574524	1.138994156171288	1.574065108091594	.723600409103923	-0.2691	.82985217051006!sample_table_end
