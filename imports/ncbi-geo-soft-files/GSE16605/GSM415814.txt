DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415814/suppl/GSM415814_KC0209.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415814/suppl/GSM415814_KC0210.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16605!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1798.474191304041	3114.946679755904	1871.596056767087	2947.823032292906	1.234485121119903	1.929954391739245	.6396447120221344	-0.4777	.71810006062358482	644.553483402176	627.6981738305726	700.253313703617	615.2858484906332	.3890671199101109	.3264443514023584	1.191832905788488	-0.0359	.9754107431167943	1910.150447273173	2666.423546329902	1985.40858369191	2530.404156300822	1.01886865581626	1.262472927544203	.8070419837027254	-0.3656	.77615608615158294	8956.45720491319	10068.28797239831	8913.373473966187	9302.46835996701	4.988188439858428	5.065466275381024	.9847441812221358	0.0573	1.0405289998725755	7971.289311353079	7522.870207475183	7956.515527245576	6992.279918773777	4.495917438296413	4.023121351693344	1.117519717968256	-0.0647	.95617703267361586	10462.65472213905	11179.44219424905	10397.29749535012	10314.11510679286	6.118349871325155	6.320503287914035	.9680162469062494	-0.0480	.9672462252967317	1609.865766268196	1716.582058684456	1683.156044723774	1641.649694232118	1.056069462571352	1.066744956691482	.9899924587848636	-0.0145	.9900048773964318	1263.311091567498	1343.54270551727	1329.351132466008	1290.867311359389	.7152051403201847	.6687930844039907	1.069396734204504	0.0934	1.0668551478349939	2114.061376379872	2661.513127679512	2190.907150461553	2525.894022904202	1.322728030429745	1.521447707856276	.8693877703450431	-0.0783	.947172580735567410	11771.41528912852	13687.07525347976	11657.06515811306	12572.7756547255	6.06226332411397	6.43803063728918	.9416331896591544	-0.1044	.930170092383762611	4273.856217713264	5252.322660411201	4337.545939284284	4920.036433667481	2.886965282371544	3.511122215373181	.8222343471073683	-0.1097	.926811423450708812	14567.52660669692	24249.26123982556	14164.16873364063	21765.06473102734	8.859405549625553	13.81615198185906	.6412353860364421	-0.3220	.799985960101570613	3415.008231391584	4169.92854062385	3490.85594213804	3925.936134650016	1.848112198487562	1.976943224434156	.9348332191059918	-0.0750	.949340762771080814	5952.763451203559	6920.919482272558	5974.872177162229	6448.454163399461	3.399865154006883	3.609570382435096	.9419029950354532	-0.1768	.8846491116672215	1369.12722391337	1454.749329297072	1435.209135979908	1395.435940674891	.7738106581509478	.7680397775478318	1.00751377828573	0.0077	1.00535965638681616	2120.199061310327	2467.540086092313	2196.959379566694	2343.63807512011	1.566549081475938	1.740163994752374	.900230717449626	-0.0002	.999875434051401417	268.6815114951837	328.3064642686698	313.4916401828555	314.3149212469158	.227374000714797	.249332349205076	.911931409781816	-0.1008	.9324999252914618	3870.80439537256	5265.428461411231	3939.022341160576	4932.829659573175	2.562441365591548	3.250742769936952	.7882633437776576	-0.1934	.874566916434641119	1266.69286856579	1367.037878215284	1330.550189111188	1312.646059874243	.6819786755957016	.6577048360996395	1.036906889175412	0.0098	1.00679616362614120	1670.496746204158	1922.376256888814	1742.605269573135	1832.033016524571	1.022850743229519	1.15588623457319	.8849060682924441	0.0256	1.017925541695824!sample_table_end
