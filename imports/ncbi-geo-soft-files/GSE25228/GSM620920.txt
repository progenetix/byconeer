The study was performed in agreement with the Institutional ethical review board of the University of Regensburg (05/003). DNA from frozen colon tissues was isolated using the PUREGENEâ¢ DNA Purification Kit (Gentra, Minneapolis, USA) according to the supplierâs recommendation.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Human peripheral blood monocytes were separated by leukapheresis of healthy donors followed by density gradient centrifugation over Ficoll/Hypaque and subsequent counter current centrifugal elutriation in a J6M-E centrifuge (Beckman Instruments) or by magnetic bead separation from buffy coats of healthy donors using CD14 antibodies.
