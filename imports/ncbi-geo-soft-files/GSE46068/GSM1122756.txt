We collected the precipitate by centrifugation  at 14000 rpm for 45 minutes at 4Â°C. We the final hybridization mixture containing 7ul dH20, 14ÂµL  20% SDS, and 49 ÂµL or Master Mix (5 mL ultra pure formamide from Invitrogen, 1g 500000MW Dextran Sulfate, 1mL 20xSSC, 1mL H20). We denatured the hybridization mixture at 73Â°C for 15 min and then incubated the samples at 37Â°C for 2hours to allow the Cot 1 DNA to anneal to repetitive DNA sequeces on both the sample and reference DNA. We exposed our printed arrays to 260000uJoules of UV using StrataLinker and applied a rubber cement ring around each array to form a well. After air drying the rubber cement we added our combined sample/reference hybridization solution onto the array. We placed a silicone gasket around the edge of the wells and laid a clean glass microscope slide on top of the gasket. We clamped the assembly together using binder clips to create an air tight environment. The arrays were incubated or 48-68 hours at 37Â°C on a slowly rocking table (1rpm). After disassembling the hybridization chamber, we rinsed off the excess hybridization fluid with PN buffer (PN: 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 0.1% nonidet P40, pH 8), then washed the arrays once in a solution containing 50% formamide in 2xSSC for 15 min. at 45Â°C and finally in PN buffer at room temperature for 15 min. We removed the ring of rubber cement, drained excess liquid from the arrays, mounted them in a solution containing 90% glycerol, 10% PBS and 1 mM DAPI, and sealed them with a cover slip.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were imaged using a custom built CCD array imaging system  and analyzed using the UCSF Spot Program to calculate Cy3/Cy5 ratios.!Sample_description = CSF2_CSF_200CTC!Sample_data_processing = Raw test/ref log2 ratios per spot have been observed in general to exhibit systematic variations of unknown origin across the array. To remove these, an in-house R package ('SpotCorrection'; publication in preparation) was employed. The observed log2 ratios are modeled as the sum of a genomic component (i.e. the desired signal) and a two-dimensional (2D) array component. The genomic and 2D components are iteratively estimated. The estimate of the 2D component after three iterations is then subtracted from the raw ratios. SpotCorrection also includes a relatively subtle correction based on clone GC content. No drastic changes in profiles are observed after correction. The resultant log2 ratios were analyzed by UCSF Sproc to yield the mean and standard deviation of the log2 ratios over replicate spots. The May 2004 freeze of the human genome sequence (hg17) was used to map the array CGH data.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6359!Sample_contact_name = Mark,,Magbanua!Sample_contact_laboratory = Park!Sample_contact_department = HemOnc!Sample_contact_institute = UCSF/Helen Diller Familiy Comprehensive Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 1450 3rd Street, PO Box 589001!Sample_contact_city = San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94158-9001!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1122nnn/GSM1122756/suppl/GSM1122756_2007_11_20_CSF2_200CTC_SPOT.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE46068!Sample_data_row_count = 2250
