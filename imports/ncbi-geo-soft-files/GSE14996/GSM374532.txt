A generic primer that recognizes the adapter sequence was used to amplify adapter ligated DNA fragments with PCR conditions optimized to preferentially amplify fragments in the 200 to 1,100 bp size range in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). After purification with magnetic beads from Agencourt (Beverly, MA), the PCR product was fragmented using DNase I and a sample of the fragmented product was visualized on a 4% TBE agarose gel to confirm that the average size was smaller than 180 bp. The fragmented DNA was then labeled with biotin.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Samples hybridized to the Affy6 chip for 18 hrs. We washed and stained the arrays using an Affymetrix fluidics Station 450 and scanned the arrays using a GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA).!Sample_scan_protocol = The Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Operating Software (GCOS) was used to collect and extract feature data from Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Scanners.!Sample_description = Kidney NL_BT_16062!Sample_data_processing = Allele-specific genomic analysis was performed using the Partek Genomic Suite (PGS) verion 6.4 allele-specific analysis algorithm, which takes advantage of genotype information and allele-specific intensities from paired samples to estimate DNA copy number for each heterozygous SNP. Allele-specific analysis can also help determine the effect of normal DNA contamination from nonmalignant cells in the tumor samples through comparison of allele ratios inside and outside regions of apparent hemizygous deletion. Please note that the currently released PGS allele-specific copy number algorithm for single sample analysis assigns one allele "Max" status and colors its data red, and assigns the other allele "Min" status and colors its data blue based on the estimated copy number for the different alleles (max=red, min=blue). This labeling is meant to convey the structure of contiguous regions with differing allele prevalence, but by itself does not imply haplotype phase across regions of similar allele prevalence. Each allele specific display in Figures 2-4 is thus independently displayed and categorization of changes into omniclonal/subclonal/indeterminate groups are based on visual interpretation of overall pattern. Examples of homozygous deletion displayed in Figure 4 were identified by examination of the allele-specific copy number data using a combination of relative and absolute copy number (both alleles generally well below 0.5 copy number) and genomic length of affected segment containing more than approximately 20 probes (each dot in Figure 4 represents data from 10 probes). We applied three different methods to jointly assess the statistical significance of observed "clonality", namely, unsupervised cluster-subject matching, supervised sample classification, and Fisher"s distance statistics. Based on a large number of random permutations, we generated the empirical distribution of the "summary statistics" under the null hypothesis that the observed "clonality" is a by-chance event. Accordingly, we used three summary statistics criteria to measure the degree of clonality, namely, cluster-subject matching error, predictive classification error, and Fisher's distance. Specifically, in the unsupervised cluster-subject matching experiment, we used the matching error between subject ID assignments and Affymetrix 6 data clusters (obtained via unsupervised hierarchical clustering) as the summary statistics. The underling null hypothesis is that the subject IDs are randomly assigned to tissue samples independent of samples" genomic signatures. We performed a large number of random permutations to assess the statistical significance of the observed label assignment. We exhaustively search among different number of clusters, to find the minimum number of "unmatched" samples as the error rate of mismatching. We obtained the observed error of hierarchical clustering as 0/58, which means 0 samples are mismatched in total 58 samples. The histogram of the error rates obtained by 10,000 permutations is shown in Supplementary Figure 5. Error rate by permutation ranges from 34/58 to 44/58. The P value associated with the observed error rate of 0/58 is below , upon which we can safely reject the null hypothesis and support the claim of "clonality".!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = Please refere to GSE14996_Methods.doc on Series record for the figures.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8226!Sample_contact_name = George,S. ,Bova!Sample_contact_email = gbova2@jhmi.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = PELICAN!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Johns Hopkins University!Sample_contact_address = 600 N.
