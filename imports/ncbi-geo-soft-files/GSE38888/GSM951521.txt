Sections were deparaffinated twice for 5 min in xylene, rehydrated in 100, 96 and 70% ethanol for 30 s each, stained with haematoxylin for 30 s, rinsed with water and incubated overnight in 1 m NaSCN at 37Â°C to remove crosslinks. Slides were rinsed twice 10 min in 1  PBS at room temperature, and completely air-dried. Tumour tissue was scraped from the glass with a scalpel to obtain at least 70% tumour cells in 200 l Qiagen ATL buffer (QIAampÂ® DNA extraction kit cat. 51306), transferred to eppendorf tubes and incubated with 27 l proteinase-K (20 mg/ml stock) at 450 rpm (EppendorfÂ® Thermomixer R) at 55Â°C. Three more aliquots of 27 l proteinase-K were added at 4, 20 and 28 h. After a total protK incubation of 44 h, DNA isolation proceeded as in the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Cat. 51306). Samples of isolated genomic DNA were analysed by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis to visualise DNA concentration and size distribution. In case of tumour tissue, we scraped regions containing at least 70% tumour as indicated by an experienced breast cancer pathologist.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Labeling was performed using the Enzo Genomic DNA Labeling kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Enzo Life Sciences). Briefly, 500 ng genomic DNA was combined with a mixture of primers and reaction buffer to a final volume of 39 Î¼l. The DNA was denatured at 99Â°C for 10 min, and placed on ice. While on ice, 10 Î¼l cyanine 3-dUTP and cyanine 5-dUTP nucleotide mixture was added to the test and reference DNA, respectively, and finally 1 Î¼l Klenow DNA polymerase was added to each sample to extend the primers. After 4 hr incubation at 37Â°C, 5 Î¼l stop buffer was added to stop the reaction. Label was purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Westburg, Leusden, NL).!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Megapool reference DNA female, EA-100F!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: Female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = sample type: control!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = aCGH reference DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes from six apparently healthy female individuals.
