Frozen tissues were homogenized by rotor-stator directly in RLT+.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = The fragmented PCR products are labeled with a single biotin at each free 3'OH using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and a dideoxy biotinylated nucleoside triphosphate.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The biotinylated fragments are added to a hybridization solution containing a biotinylated control oligonucletide (for quality control), and hybridized to a microarray chip overnight at 49Â°C.!Sample_scan_protocol = The chips are then transferred to a fluidics instrument that performs washes to remove DNA that has not hybridized to its complementary oligonucleotide probe. The bound DNA is then fluorescently labeled using phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (SAPE) followed by biotinylated anti-streptavidin, followed by SAPE. Each DNA bound at its complementary oligonucleotide is excited using a confocal laser scanner, and the positions and intensities of the fluorescent emissions are captured.!Sample_description = Standard ovarian cancer cell line-250KSty!Sample_data_processing = CEL files and TXT files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by dChip and model-based expression performed using the PM/MM model. Invariant set normalization was performed as described in Lee and Wong, Genome Biology 2001, 2(8).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tan,A,Ince!Sample_contact_email = Tince@med.miami.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 305-243-1782!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Ince Lab - TCC!Sample_contact_department = Sylvester Cancer Center!Sample_contact_institute = University of Miami - Miller School of Medicine!Sample_contact_address = 1501 NW 10th Avenue, Rm 926!Sample_contact_city = Miami!Sample_contact_state = FL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33136!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1001nnn/GSM1001488/suppl/GSM1001488_A2780.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1001nnn/GSM1001488/suppl/GSM1001488_A2780.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE40787!Sample_series_id = GSE40788!Sample_data_row_count = 238354
