The digested DNA was labeled by random priming using the Bioprime DNA Labeling Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA).  DNA was labeled with Cy3-dUTP (PerkinElmer, Waltham, USA) . Labeled product was purified with Microcon YM (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). !Sample_source_name_ch2 = GBM5 - tumor DNA!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Age: 75; Gender: Male; WHO grade IV!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = DNA was extracted with Macherey Nagel NucleoSpin Tissue Kit.

Labeled product was purified with Microcon YM (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). !Sample_hyb_protocol = Tumor and control DNAs were pooled and hybridized with 50microg of Human Cot I DNA at 65Â°C with rotation for 48 hours. Washing was performed according to the Agilent protocol.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were analyzed using the Agilent G2565BA microarray scanner and the Feature Extraction software (FE v9.4.1, CGH_44k_1005 protocol). !Sample_description = Low quality spots were flagged according to default FE criteria and corresponding values were removed.!Sample_data_processing = Data preprocessing was carried out using limma (R package) from Bioconductor with adaptation to array CGH data files. Quality control was performed by visualization of the spatial distribution of probes; background array images and examination of boxplots, histograms, global MvA plots and per chromosome MvA plots. Median pixel feature intensity values were median normalized. Missing values were imputed by the use of the k-nearest neighbors method implemented in impute (R package). !Sample_platform_id = GPL2879!Sample_contact_name = Marie,,de Tayrac!Sample_contact_email = marie.de-tayrac@univ-rennes1.fr!Sample_contact_phone = 0223234776!Sample_contact_laboratory = Regulation of transcription and oncogenesis!Sample_contact_institute = CNRS-UMR6061!Sample_contact_address = 2 avenue du Professeur LÃ©on Bernard!Sample_contact_city = Rennes!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35000!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM275nnn/GSM275626/suppl/GSM275626.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE10878!Sample_data_row_count = 42896#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (Cy3/Cy5)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE3	-0.1407786557827974	-0.01883761417899795	-0.2781412982240036	-0.07301798645201267	0.1019624109454548	-0.3182639265541859	-0.096676019411672710	0.15529817300663111	-0.13737170456752512	-0.21888730214941213	-0.037030730944968214	-0.43120962532614615	-0.31530171545076716	0.15919859484925317	0.02732361005269918	-0.27202318906104919	-0.16532146788969720	0.081348539881264321	-0.29765260270337122	-0.246785054188718!sample_table_end
