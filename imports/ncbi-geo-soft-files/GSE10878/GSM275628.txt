The digested DNA was labeled by random priming using the Bioprime DNA Labeling Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA).  DNA was labeled with Cy3-dUTP (PerkinElmer, Waltham, USA) . Labeled product was purified with Microcon YM (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). !Sample_source_name_ch2 = GBM7 - tumor DNA!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Age: 60; Gender: Male; WHO grade IV!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = DNA was extracted with Macherey Nagel NucleoSpin Tissue Kit.

Labeled product was purified with Microcon YM (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). !Sample_hyb_protocol = Tumor and control DNAs were pooled and hybridized with 50microg of Human Cot I DNA at 65Â°C with rotation for 48 hours. Washing was performed according to the Agilent protocol.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were analyzed using the Agilent G2565BA microarray scanner and the Feature Extraction software (FE v9.4.1, CGH_44k_1005 protocol). !Sample_description = Low quality spots were flagged according to default FE criteria and corresponding values were removed.!Sample_data_processing = Data preprocessing was carried out using limma (R package) from Bioconductor with adaptation to array CGH data files. Quality control was performed by visualization of the spatial distribution of probes; background array images and examination of boxplots, histograms, global MvA plots and per chromosome MvA plots. Median pixel feature intensity values were median normalized. Missing values were imputed by the use of the k-nearest neighbors method implemented in impute (R package). !Sample_platform_id = GPL2879!Sample_contact_name = Marie,,de Tayrac!Sample_contact_email = marie.de-tayrac@univ-rennes1.fr!Sample_contact_phone = 0223234776!Sample_contact_laboratory = Regulation of transcription and oncogenesis!Sample_contact_institute = CNRS-UMR6061!Sample_contact_address = 2 avenue du Professeur LÃ©on Bernard!Sample_contact_city = Rennes!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35000!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM275nnn/GSM275628/suppl/GSM275628.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE10878!Sample_data_row_count = 42896#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (Cy3/Cy5)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE3	-0.3104229480966514	-0.06659638941370545	-0.2651420687957846	-0.02179599788410427	-0.02595440491635968	-0.2634417798059459	-0.074458507186676610	0.14049673248080911	-0.41255789274518412	-0.022285544899621513	-0.041061297306566914	-0.30578405329313215	-0.14806894961920716	-0.065610605268149817	-0.01721455535219918	-0.43338580324804519	-0.26064067656084420	0.081660694730605821	-0.17407248806471222	-0.265142068795785!sample_table_end
