The quantification of DNA was done by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop, Labtech); integrity and purity were analyzed on 1% agarose gel.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 5microg DNA were double-digested with AluI and RsaI (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) for 2h at 37C. The digested DNA was labeled by random priming using the Bioprime DNA Labeling Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA).  DNA was labeled with Cy3-dUTP (PerkinElmer, Waltham, USA) . Labeled product was purified with Microcon YM (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). !Sample_source_name_ch2 = GBM3 -  blood DNA!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Age: 60 Gender: Female; WHO grade IV!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Classical saline extraction from peripheral blood leucocytes.

Labeled product was purified with Microcon YM (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). !Sample_hyb_protocol = Tumor and control DNAs were pooled and hybridized with 50microg of Human Cot I DNA at 65Â°C with rotation for 48 hours. Washing was performed according to the Agilent protocol.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were analyzed using the Agilent G2565BA microarray scanner and the Feature Extraction software (FE v9.4.1, CGH_44k_1005 protocol). !Sample_description = Low quality spots were flagged according to default FE criteria and corresponding values were removed.!Sample_data_processing = Data preprocessing was carried out using limma (R package) from Bioconductor with adaptation to array CGH data files. Quality control was performed by visualization of the spatial distribution of probes; background array images and examination of boxplots, histograms, global MvA plots and per chromosome MvA plots. Median pixel feature intensity values were median normalized. Missing values were imputed by the use of the k-nearest neighbors method implemented in impute (R package). !Sample_platform_id = GPL2879!Sample_contact_name = Marie,,de Tayrac!Sample_contact_email = marie.de-tayrac@univ-rennes1.fr!Sample_contact_phone = 0223234776!Sample_contact_laboratory = Regulation of transcription and oncogenesis!Sample_contact_institute = CNRS-UMR6061!Sample_contact_address = 2 avenue du Professeur LÃ©on Bernard!Sample_contact_city = Rennes!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35000!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM275nnn/GSM275607/suppl/GSM275607.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE10878!Sample_data_row_count = 42896#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (Cy3/Cy5)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE3	0.09824812769045284	-0.1587663847212225	-0.1664323954528866	-0.01300346029851967	-0.04017043847553668	0.1816095555303719	-0.23866459211461910	-0.50693016525833111	0.031296130489536712	0.04645425455811313	-0.080099452836855714	0.22600367488882415	-0.22618682280748516	-0.11545269200891117	-0.2009079246783118	-0.037030730944968219	-0.17573700177656220	-0.10911028009306921	0.0048170162977747622	-0.253164161809735!sample_table_end
