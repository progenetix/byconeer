The quantification of DNA was done by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop, Labtech); integrity and purity were analyzed on 1% agarose gel.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 5microg DNA were double-digested with AluI and RsaI (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) for 2h at 37C. The digested DNA was labeled by random priming using the Bioprime DNA Labeling Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA).  DNA was labeled with Cy3-dUTP (PerkinElmer, Waltham, USA) . Labeled product was purified with Microcon YM (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). !Sample_source_name_ch2 = GBM17 - blood DNA!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Age: 65; Gender: Female; WHO grade IV!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Classical saline extraction from peripheral blood leucocytes.

Labeled product was purified with Microcon YM (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). !Sample_hyb_protocol = Tumor and control DNAs were pooled and hybridized with 50microg of Human Cot I DNA at 65Â°C with rotation for 48 hours. Washing was performed according to the Agilent protocol.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were analyzed using the Agilent G2565BA microarray scanner and the Feature Extraction software (FE v9.4.1, CGH_44k_1005 protocol). !Sample_description = Low quality spots were flagged according to default FE criteria and corresponding values were removed.!Sample_data_processing = Data preprocessing was carried out using limma (R package) from Bioconductor with adaptation to array CGH data files. Quality control was performed by visualization of the spatial distribution of probes; background array images and examination of boxplots, histograms, global MvA plots and per chromosome MvA plots. Median pixel feature intensity values were median normalized. Missing values were imputed by the use of the k-nearest neighbors method implemented in impute (R package). !Sample_platform_id = GPL2879!Sample_contact_name = Marie,,de Tayrac!Sample_contact_email = marie.de-tayrac@univ-rennes1.fr!Sample_contact_phone = 0223234776!Sample_contact_laboratory = Regulation of transcription and oncogenesis!Sample_contact_institute = CNRS-UMR6061!Sample_contact_address = 2 avenue du Professeur LÃ©on Bernard!Sample_contact_city = Rennes!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35000!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM275nnn/GSM275620/suppl/GSM275620.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE10878!Sample_data_row_count = 42896#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (Cy3/Cy5)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE3	0.05024037729414044	-0.08812044768388735	-0.2632508804445826	-0.1735533992189197	-0.3022760374266458	-0.1277248053431449	-0.39651741130804610	-0.52047587357315111	-0.22783077478373412	0.15660900229110613	-0.14883096980768814	-0.70137199283646615	-0.02330008772382916	-0.30176453412722817	-0.34890250342072718	-0.051869239920599819	-0.1320911143475820	-0.2847464966544321	-0.076516764991796822	0.0553568561511701!sample_table_end
