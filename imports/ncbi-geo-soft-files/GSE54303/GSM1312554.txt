Hybridization was performed for 48 h in a container placed on a slowly rocking table containing 200 Î¼l of 50% form amide and 2Ã SSC to control moisture.    It was followed by 15 min post hybridization washing in 50% form amide/2Ã SSC at 50Â°C, 30 min in 2Ã SSC/0.1% SDS at 50Â°C, 15 min in PN buffer consisting of 0.1 M NaH2PO4, 0.1 M Na2HPO4 at (pH 8.0), and 0.1% NP40 at room temperature, rinsing in 2Ã SSC at room temperature, and finally dehydration in 70%, 85%, 100% ethanol at room temperature for 2 min each and air-drying.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanning analysis was carried out with the Agilent Micro Array Scanner (Agilent Technologies).!Sample_description = file with raw data for this sample: Follicular_lymphoma_1.txt!Sample_data_processing = Acquired array images were analyzed using Genepix Pro 4.1 (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). DNA spots were automatically segmented, the local background was subtracted, and the total intensities and fluorescence intensity ratio of the two dyes for each spot were calculated. Fluorescence intensity ratio of the two dyes (Cy3 intensity/Cy5 intensity) were converted into log2 intensity ratios (log2 ratio).  In order to remove the so-called probe effect, we first selected a subset of the samples whose Pearson's correlation coefficient r > 0.5 (p=2E-155), where correlation was computed after removing obvious genomic aberrations manually.   Then, at each probe, we considered the median value of those selected samples as the probe specific bias, and it was subtracted from the log2 ratios of the entire samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL18197!Sample_contact_name = Miyuki,Suguro,Katayama!Sample_contact_email = mkatayama@aichi-cc.jp!Sample_contact_phone = +81-52-762-6111!Sample_contact_department = Division of Molecular Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute!Sample_contact_address = 1-1 Kanokoden, Chikusa-ku!Sample_contact_city = Nagoya!Sample_contact_state = Aichi!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 464-8681!Sample_contact_country = Japan!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE54303!Sample_data_row_count = 2253
