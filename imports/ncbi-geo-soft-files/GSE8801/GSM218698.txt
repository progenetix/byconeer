Following centrifugation (30 min at 14000 rpm), the probes were re-suspended in 5 â¡l of water, 10 â¡l 20% SDS and 35 â¡l of Master Mix #1, heated to 73âC for 10 minutes and incubated for 60 minutes at 37âC to block repetitive elements on the probe. Hybridization was performed for 48 hours at 37âC. After hybridization, the slides were washed with PN solution at room temperature followed by a 15 min wash with wash solution (50% Formamide, 2X SSC, pH 7). DAPI was applied to the slides for Image analysis using a custom built CCD camera system!Sample_scan_protocol = Image analysis using a custom built CCD camera system!Sample_description = aCGH data from ER+ breast tumor!Sample_data_processing = Data analysis was carried out using UCSF Spot software. SPROC software was used to automatically filter the data to reject data points based on low DAPI intensity, low correlation between Cy3 and Cy5 and low reference/DAPI signal intensity. Observations with standard deviation of replicates grater then 0.2 were declared missing.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4999!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Yau!Sample_contact_email = cyau@buckinstitute.org!Sample_contact_phone = 415-209-2248!Sample_contact_laboratory = Benz Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Buck Institute of Age Research!Sample_contact_address = 8001 Redwood Blvd!Sample_contact_city = Novato!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94945!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM218nnn/GSM218698/suppl/GSM218698.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8801!Sample_data_row_count = 2464#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 ratio (test/reference) normalized to genome median log2 ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEHumArray2H11_N30	HumArray2H11_C9	-0.016671HumArray2H10_N30	-0.08716HumArray2H10_B18	-0.167433HumArray2H10_Q30	-0.104549HumArray2H10_T30	-0.087266HumArray2H10_B19	0.013248HumArray2H10_W30	-0.159725HumArray2H9_C14	-0.142316HumArray2H9_F14	-0.175051HumArray2H9_I14	-0.170831HumArray2H9_A23	-0.085086HumArray2H9_L14	HumArray2H9_O14	-0.077574HumArray2H11_L8	-0.03636HumArray2H9_B4	HumArray2H10_E19	-0.145922HumArray2H9_U14	-0.192291HumArray2H9_R14	-0.157912HumArray2H9_C17	-0.162568!sample_table_end
