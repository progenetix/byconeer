Following centrifugation (30 min at 14000 rpm), the probes were re-suspended in 5 â¡l of water, 10 â¡l 20% SDS and 35 â¡l of Master Mix #1, heated to 73âC for 10 minutes and incubated for 60 minutes at 37âC to block repetitive elements on the probe. Hybridization was performed for 48 hours at 37âC. After hybridization, the slides were washed with PN solution at room temperature followed by a 15 min wash with wash solution (50% Formamide, 2X SSC, pH 7). DAPI was applied to the slides for Image analysis using a custom built CCD camera system!Sample_scan_protocol = Image analysis using a custom built CCD camera system!Sample_description = aCGH data from ER+ breast tumor!Sample_data_processing = Data analysis was carried out using UCSF Spot software. SPROC software was used to automatically filter the data to reject data points based on low DAPI intensity, low correlation between Cy3 and Cy5 and low reference/DAPI signal intensity. Observations with standard deviation of replicates grater then 0.2 were declared missing.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4999!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Yau!Sample_contact_email = cyau@buckinstitute.org!Sample_contact_phone = 415-209-2248!Sample_contact_laboratory = Benz Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Buck Institute of Age Research!Sample_contact_address = 8001 Redwood Blvd!Sample_contact_city = Novato!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94945!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM218nnn/GSM218705/suppl/GSM218705.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8801!Sample_data_row_count = 2464#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 ratio (test/reference) normalized to genome median log2 ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEHumArray2H11_N30	-0.206436HumArray2H11_C9	0.179036HumArray2H10_N30	0.007568HumArray2H10_B18	-0.040835HumArray2H10_Q30	0.053964HumArray2H10_T30	0.044049HumArray2H10_B19	-0.11684HumArray2H10_W30	-0.023357HumArray2H9_C14	HumArray2H9_F14	HumArray2H9_I14	HumArray2H9_A23	HumArray2H9_L14	HumArray2H9_O14	HumArray2H11_L8	-0.017323HumArray2H9_B4	HumArray2H10_E19	HumArray2H9_U14	HumArray2H9_R14	HumArray2H9_C17	!sample_table_end
