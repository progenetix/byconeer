Following centrifugation (30 min at 14000 rpm), the probes were re-suspended in 5 â¡l of water, 10 â¡l 20% SDS and 35 â¡l of Master Mix #1, heated to 73âC for 10 minutes and incubated for 60 minutes at 37âC to block repetitive elements on the probe. Hybridization was performed for 48 hours at 37âC. After hybridization, the slides were washed with PN solution at room temperature followed by a 15 min wash with wash solution (50% Formamide, 2X SSC, pH 7).

SPROC software was used to automatically filter the data to reject data points based on low DAPI intensity, low correlation between Cy3 and Cy5 and low reference/DAPI signal intensity. Observations with standard deviation of replicates grater then 0.2 were declared missing.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4999!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Yau!Sample_contact_email = cyau@buckinstitute.org!Sample_contact_phone = 415-209-2248!Sample_contact_laboratory = Benz Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Buck Institute of Age Research!Sample_contact_address = 8001 Redwood Blvd!Sample_contact_city = Novato!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94945!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM218nnn/GSM218737/suppl/GSM218737.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8801!Sample_data_row_count = 2464#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 ratio (test/reference) normalized to genome median log2 ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEHumArray2H11_N30	-0.022287HumArray2H11_C9	0.138621HumArray2H10_N30	-0.096653HumArray2H10_B18	-0.159148HumArray2H10_Q30	-0.158476HumArray2H10_T30	-0.278626HumArray2H10_B19	-0.000886HumArray2H10_W30	-0.365264HumArray2H9_C14	-0.208661HumArray2H9_F14	-0.186567HumArray2H9_I14	-0.1504HumArray2H9_A23	-0.170872HumArray2H9_L14	HumArray2H9_O14	-0.137131HumArray2H11_L8	0.010894HumArray2H9_B4	HumArray2H10_E19	-0.366222HumArray2H9_U14	-0.123452HumArray2H9_R14	-0.084409HumArray2H9_C17	-0.224276!sample_table_end
