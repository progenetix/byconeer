Briefly labeled probes were combined in 45ul of DIGEasy based hybridization buffer containing 1100ug Cot-1 DNA, hybridization then took place under a coverslip for 36 hours at 45C. Slides were washed in 0.1X SSC 0.1% SDS 5 x 5 min, and rinsed with 0.1X SSC. Slides were then dried by centrifugation prior to scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Images were scanned using and API Arrayworx e Auto Scanner.
