All fragments resulting from restriction enzyme digestion was then ligated using T4 ligase and PCR-amplified using an Applied Biosystems  Thermal Cycler I (9700) to achieve a size range of 200â1,100 bp. Amplified DNA was then pooled, concentrated and cleaned up. The amplified and cleaned product was fragmented using DNaseI (Affymetrix Inc.) and subsequently labeled and denatured using standard Affymetrix protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The biotinylated DNA was added to a hybridization solution and hybridized overnight at 49Â°C using standard Affymetrix protocol.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized arrays were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix Inc).!Sample_description = MBra-LungNSP-14-1a-250KNSP!Sample_data_processing = SNP 250K-NSpI array analysis: We used the 250K-Nsp I array platform from the Affymetrix 500K array set for genotyping each sample.  The genotype call was automatically detected by the Affymetrixâ Genotype Analysis (GTYPE) Software.  Data were analyzed with dChip using HMM model. Nexus program was also used in parallel.  Individual genes were identified based on the SNP ID.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = Determination of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number variation (CNV): The resulting data was anlyzed using both dChip (www.dchip.org) and Nexus software package (http://www.snp-nexus.org) for the determination of LOH and CNV respectively. Intensity (.CEL) files was normalized and modeled using the PM-MM difference modeling method. Array normalization and quality control was performed as per the Affymetrix protocol and requirement. A region of "LOH" was designated when there was a consicutive loss of at least 10 SNPs. The Nexus program was utilized parallely to identify the copy neutral and copy number losses/gains as well as homozygous deletion based on the standard data interpretation criteria.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Santanu,,Dasgupta!Sample_contact_email = sdasgupta@vcu.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Virginia Commonwealth University!Sample_contact_address = 1220 E Broad Street!Sample_contact_city = Richmond!Sample_contact_state = VA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 23298!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM725nnn/GSM725914/suppl/GSM725914_MBra-LungNSP-14-1a-250KNSP.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM725nnn/GSM725914/suppl/GSM725914_MBra-LungNSP-14-1a-250KNSP.CHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM725nnn/GSM725914/suppl/GSM725914_MBra-LungNSP-14-1a-250KNSP.cn.cnt.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM725nnn/GSM725914/suppl/GSM725914_MBra-LungNSP-14-1a-250KNSP.loh.cnt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29365!Sample_data_row_count = 262338#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall as per Affymetrix specifications and guidelines.#CONFIDENCE = #RAS1 = Relative allele signal for the data in the first probe group#RAS2 = Relative allele signal for the data in the second probe group#P-VALUE AA = #P-VALUE AB = #P-VALUE BB = #P-VALUE NO CALL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	RAS1	RAS2	P-VALUE AA	P-VALUE AB	P-VALUE BB	P-VALUE NO CALLAFFX-5Q-123	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-456	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-789	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-ABC	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeA	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeB	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeC	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeD	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeE	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeF	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeG	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeH	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeI	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeJ	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeK	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeL	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeM	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeN	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeO	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeP	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0!sample_table_end
