DNA pellet was dissolved in hybridisation mixture. Sample was hybridized for 20 hours followed post-hybridisation washes and drying of slides by using an automated hybridisation station (Tecan Benelux BVBA, Giesen, The Netherlands).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Genepix 4100A scanner.!Sample_scan_protocol = Images were quantified using Genepix Pro 4.1 software.!Sample_description = n/a!Sample_data_processing = Within this software, spots in which the reference DNA intensity was either below five times the average of the background or presented more than 3% saturated pixels were excluded from further analyses. The test/reference ratios were normalized for the median of the ratios of all features. The triplicates of the features were averaged in a homemade routine developed in Microsoft Excel 2000, and spots outside the 20% confidence interval of the average of the replicate were excluded. Only those targets presenting at least two spots within 20% confidence interval of their average were used. Unbalances of the targets were determined based on log2 ratios of the average of their replicates, and we considered sequences as amplified or deleted when outside the Â±0.3 range.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13392!Sample_contact_name = Marloes,,van Kester!Sample_contact_email = m.s.van_kester@lumc.nl!Sample_contact_department = Dermatology!Sample_contact_institute = Leiden University Medical Center !Sample_contact_address = Einthovenweg 20!Sample_contact_city = Leiden!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 2333 ZC!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM325nnn/GSM325154/suppl/GSM325154.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12902!Sample_data_row_count = 3478#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (Cy3/Cy5) representing test/reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEGS-232-B23	0.167780424GS-62-L8	0.167780424RP11-465B22	0.167780424RP4-785P20	0.167780424RP1-37J18	0.163762262RP11-49J3	0.163762262RP3-438L4	-0.016238737RP11-338N10	-0.016238737RP11-484P7	0.163762262RP3-510D11	0.038645928RP4-575L21	0.076431804RP4-635E18	0.008696199RP4-539L13	0.065487402RP11-196P5	0.122037672RP4-636F13	0.053439259RP11-285P3	0.038645928RP4-560M15	-0.011653087RP11-45I3	0.076431804RP1-37C10	0.002717452RP11-174G17	0.008696199!sample_table_end
