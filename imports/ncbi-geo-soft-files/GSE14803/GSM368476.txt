The sections were then deparaffinized with Xylene, processed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and stained with haematoxylin. Lasercapture microdissection for both lesions was performed at multiple sites using Veritas Arcturus. Cells were digested in 10ul TE, pH 9, and 0.5ul proteinase K (20mg/ml) for 48h at 55degC . After inactivation of proteinase K at 99degC  for 10min, the digest was stored at -20degC .  Without any further purification, the complete digest was used for whole genome amplification by means of the WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) kit from Sigma.!Sample_label_ch1 = Alexa Fluor 3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming according Invitrogens recommendation (Invitrogen BioPrime Total Genomic Labeling System).Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = reference - DNA pool isolated from laser captured microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy tissue.!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: mammary tissue without histomorphological changes obtained from reduction mammoplasty specimens!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Whole genome amplification by GenomePlex (Sigma).!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens cut at 7-8um were mounted on special foil-coated slides (Molecular Devices, San Diego, USA).

Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.15 and -0.15, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM368nnn/GSM368476/suppl/GSM368476.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14803!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio Cy3/Cy5 (subgrid lowess)#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	-0.024	1019	208	420	74	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	219	210	87	76	01_1_3_397B22	0.023	2050	202	864	73	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	673	198	338	67	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	788	205	356	75	01_1_6_F0488J12	0.081	5072	202	2185	74	01_1_7_N0413M21	-0.188	521	202	200	74	01_1_8_D2542F24	-0.086	1185	203	465	70	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.068	1021	204	448	70	01_1_10_N0673B19	null	377	336	158	129	-501_1_11_N0090E12(del)	null	985	408	436	156	-501_1_12_N0097G03	null	2371	280	973	106	-1001_1_13_N1030C19	null	1203	259	516	100	-501_1_14_N0345M21	null	843	240	335	88	-501_1_15_N0281A03	null	1778	244	688	85	-1001_1_16_N0771D21	null	1564	329	636	118	-501_1_17_N0504D21	null	975	458	412	174	-501_1_18_N0490A23	null	3172	508	1241	188	-501_1_19_M2112G04	0.321	824	389	433	139	01_1_20_N0282F14	0.011	1819	205	762	73	0!sample_table_end
