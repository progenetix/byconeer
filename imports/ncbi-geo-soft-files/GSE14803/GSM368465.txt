The sections were then deparaffinized with Xylene, processed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and stained with haematoxylin. Lasercapture microdissection for both lesions was performed at multiple sites using Veritas Arcturus. Cells were digested in 10ul TE, pH 9, and 0.5ul proteinase K (20mg/ml) for 48h at 55degC . After inactivation of proteinase K at 99degC  for 10min, the digest was stored at -20Â°C.  Without any further purification, the complete digest was used for whole genome amplification by means of the WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) kit from Sigma.!Sample_label_ch1 = Alexa Fluor 3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming according Invitrogens recommendation (Invitrogen BioPrime Total Genomic Labeling System).Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = reference - DNA pool isolated from laser captured microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy tissue.!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: mammary tissue without histomorphological changes obtained from reduction mammoplasty specimens!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Whole genome amplification by GenomePlex (Sigma).!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens cut at 7-8um were mounted on special foil-coated slides (Molecular Devices, San Diego, USA).

PMT settings: 100/100!Sample_description = Array CGH analysis of a female patient with pleomorphic/necrotic lobular intraepithelial neoplasia (LIN3) which was composed purely of signet-ring cells. Corresponding resected tumor to Patient 1-1.!Sample_data_processing = TIFF images were analysed by Genepix 5.0 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and raw intensities (gpr files) were imported into CGHPRO (Chen at al.,2005).Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.15 and -0.15, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM368nnn/GSM368465/suppl/GSM368465.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14803!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio Cy3/Cy5 (subgrid lowess)#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	0.084	1041	252	646	202	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	260	246	206	188	-501_1_3_397B22	0.368	1778	256	1402	205	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	632	252	443	214	-1001_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	669	254	364	213	-1001_1_6_F0488J12	-0.188	3157	247	1730	243	01_1_7_N0413M21	null	585	256	433	261	-1001_1_8_D2542F24	-0.046	1214	272	684	265	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.528	872	267	738	253	01_1_10_N0673B19	null	942	392	911	293	-1001_1_11_N0090E12(del)	null	603	397	428	385	-1001_1_12_N0097G03	0.078	2384	477	1551	357	01_1_13_N1030C19	-0.05	1190	453	669	315	01_1_14_N0345M21	null	748	264	589	281	-1001_1_15_N0281A03	null	1836	274	1067	290	-1001_1_16_N0771D21	null	1291	275	897	298	-1001_1_17_N0504D21	null	1134	281	833	293	-1001_1_18_N0490A23	-0.151	4199	266	2427	270	01_1_19_M2112G04	0.345	886	306	665	315	01_1_20_N0282F14	null	2875	280	1941	293	-100!sample_table_end
