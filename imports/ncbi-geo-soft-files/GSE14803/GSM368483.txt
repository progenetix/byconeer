The sections were then deparaffinized with Xylene, processed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and stained with haematoxylin. Lasercapture microdissection for both lesions was performed at multiple sites using Veritas Arcturus. Cells were digested in 10ul TE, pH 9, and 0.5ul proteinase K (20mg/ml) for 48h at 55degC . After inactivation of proteinase K at 99degC  for 10min, the digest was stored at -20degC .  Without any further purification, the complete digest was used for whole genome amplification by means of the WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) kit from Sigma.!Sample_label_ch1 = Alexa Fluor 3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming according Invitrogens recommendation (Invitrogen BioPrime Total Genomic Labeling System).Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = reference - DNA pool isolated from laser captured microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy tissue.!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: mammary tissue without histomorphological changes obtained from reduction mammoplasty specimens!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Whole genome amplification by GenomePlex (Sigma).!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens cut at 7-8um were mounted on special foil-coated slides (Molecular Devices, San Diego, USA).

Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.15 and -0.15, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM368nnn/GSM368483/suppl/GSM368483.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14803!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio Cy3/Cy5 (subgrid lowess)#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	null	1431	251	801	76	-1001_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	359	239	122	74	01_1_3_397B22	null	2670	236	1151	74	-1001_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	798	237	179	75	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	1169	238	158	73	01_1_6_F0488J12	-0.072	5870	248	2138	75	01_1_7_N0413M21	-0.056	606	253	214	77	01_1_8_D2542F24	-0.107	1494	257	524	75	01_1_9_N0137H06	-0.106	1298	268	453	77	01_1_10_N0673B19	0.243	1230	254	548	75	01_1_11_N0090E12(del)	0.003	786	255	292	77	01_1_12_N0097G03	-0.067	3172	253	1182	74	01_1_13_N1030C19	-0.042	1375	239	503	69	01_1_14_N0345M21	0.042	893	272	343	87	01_1_15_N0281A03	null	1178	371	470	131	-501_1_16_N0771D21	null	1433	367	552	125	-501_1_17_N0504D21	0.066	1392	243	550	81	01_1_18_N0490A23	0.139	5379	245	2267	82	01_1_19_M2112G04	-0.026	965	249	354	83	01_1_20_N0282F14	0.082	2631	247	1085	80	0!sample_table_end
