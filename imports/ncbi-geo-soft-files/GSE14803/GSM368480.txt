The sections were then deparaffinized with Xylene, processed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and stained with haematoxylin. Lasercapture microdissection for both lesions was performed at multiple sites using Veritas Arcturus. Cells were digested in 10ul TE, pH 9, and 0.5ul proteinase K (20mg/ml) for 48h at 55degC . After inactivation of proteinase K at 99degC  for 10min, the digest was stored at -20degC .  Without any further purification, the complete digest was used for whole genome amplification by means of the WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) kit from Sigma.!Sample_label_ch1 = Alexa Fluor 3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming according Invitrogens recommendation (Invitrogen BioPrime Total Genomic Labeling System).Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = reference - DNA pool isolated from laser captured microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy tissue.!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: mammary tissue without histomorphological changes obtained from reduction mammoplasty specimens!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Whole genome amplification by GenomePlex (Sigma).!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens cut at 7-8um were mounted on special foil-coated slides (Molecular Devices, San Diego, USA).

Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.15 and -0.15, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM368nnn/GSM368480/suppl/GSM368480.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14803!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio Cy3/Cy5 (subgrid lowess)#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	0.033	1506	247	605	65	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	286	246	86	66	01_1_3_397B22	0.324	2582	239	1357	62	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	828	241	178	63	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	1262	244	117	62	01_1_6_F0488J12	-0.213	7297	244	2793	62	01_1_7_N0413M21	0.15	662	244	258	63	01_1_8_D2542F24	0.054	1557	243	638	63	01_1_9_N0137H06	-0.159	1119	243	377	63	01_1_10_N0673B19	0.623	967	245	567	62	01_1_11_N0090E12(del)	0.098	874	249	343	62	01_1_12_N0097G03	0.329	3916	252	2135	64	01_1_13_N1030C19	-0.062	1382	244	515	63	01_1_14_N0345M21	0.124	757	241	296	63	01_1_15_N0281A03	0.036	3361	247	1444	65	01_1_16_N0771D21	-0.029	2254	242	911	64	01_1_17_N0504D21	0.086	1379	243	571	63	01_1_18_N0490A23	-0.276	6334	253	2301	64	01_1_19_M2112G04	-0.026	1010	249	370	64	01_1_20_N0282F14	0.108	2487	247	1123	63	0!sample_table_end
