The sections were then deparaffinized with Xylene, processed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and stained with haematoxylin. Lasercapture microdissection for both lesions was performed at multiple sites using Veritas Arcturus. Cells were digested in 10ul TE, pH 9, and 0.5ul proteinase K (20mg/ml) for 48h at 55degC . After inactivation of proteinase K at 99degC  for 10min, the digest was stored at -20degC .  Without any further purification, the complete digest was used for whole genome amplification by means of the WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) kit from Sigma.!Sample_label_ch1 = Alexa Fluor 3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming according Invitrogens recommendation (Invitrogen BioPrime Total Genomic Labeling System).Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = reference - DNA pool isolated from laser captured microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy tissue.!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: mammary tissue without histomorphological changes obtained from reduction mammoplasty specimens!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Whole genome amplification by GenomePlex (Sigma).!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens cut at 7-8um were mounted on special foil-coated slides (Molecular Devices, San Diego, USA).

Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.15 and -0.15, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM368nnn/GSM368478/suppl/GSM368478.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14803!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio Cy3/Cy5 (subgrid lowess)#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	-0.033	1517	236	662	60	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	235	242	67	62	-501_1_3_397B22	-0.057	2356	247	1042	62	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	762	246	178	65	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	1117	252	142	65	01_1_6_F0488J12	0.015	6308	258	2971	67	01_1_7_N0413M21	-0.078	697	257	266	68	01_1_8_D2542F24	0.043	1478	251	680	65	01_1_9_N0137H06	-0.091	1073	258	434	64	01_1_10_N0673B19	0.205	1037	265	520	68	01_1_11_N0090E12(del)	0.195	785	256	375	66	01_1_12_N0097G03	0.278	3178	256	1783	65	01_1_13_N1030C19	-0.032	1241	276	533	68	01_1_14_N0345M21	0.004	943	264	402	63	01_1_15_N0281A03	-0.02	2673	257	1220	63	01_1_16_N0771D21	0.026	2219	265	1038	65	01_1_17_N0504D21	0.068	1399	275	652	69	01_1_18_N0490A23	0.085	5730	257	2828	64	01_1_19_M2112G04	-0.006	902	254	379	63	01_1_20_N0282F14	0.085	2327	268	1138	66	0!sample_table_end
