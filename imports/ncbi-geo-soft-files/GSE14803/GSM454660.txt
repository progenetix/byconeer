The sections were then deparaffinized with Xylene, processed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and stained with haematoxylin. Lasercapture microdissection for both lesions was performed at multiple sites using Veritas Arcturus. Cells were digested in 10?l TE, pH 9, and 0.5?l proteinase K (20mg/ml) for 48h at 55?C. After inactivation of proteinase K at 99?C for 10min, the digest was stored at -20?C.  Without any further purification, the complete digest was used for whole genome amplification by means of the WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) kit from Sigma.!Sample_label_ch1 = Alexa Fluor? 3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming according Invitrogens recommendation (Invitrogen BioPrime? Total Genomic Labeling System).Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DNA pool isolated from laser captured microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy tissue.!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: mammary tissue without histomorphological changes obtained from reduction mammoplasty specimens!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Whole genome amplification by GenomePlex (Sigma).!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens cut at 7-8?m were mounted on special foil-coated slides (Molecular Devices, San Diego, USA).

Repeat of Patient 7-1.!Sample_data_processing = TIFF images were analysed by Genepix 5.0 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and raw intensities (gpr files) were imported into CGHPRO (Chen at al.,2005).Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.15 and -0.15, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454660/suppl/GSM454660_MC_7993_7994_r_Cy3_LIN17555_A_GP_Cy5_fpool_GP_S33_90608.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14803!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log ratio (subgrid lowess)#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	0.46	2925	238	1658	44	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	5159	242	2320	44	01_1_3_397B22	-0.006	4473	244	1866	44	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	248	240	44	43	-501_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	238	257	43	52	-501_1_6_F0488J12	null	1650	296	603	73	-1001_1_7_N0413M21	-0.295	3668	239	1231	43	01_1_8_D2542F24	null	277	237	66	43	-501_1_9_N0137H06	-0.169	2399	245	868	44	01_1_10_N0673B19	null	230	238	42	43	-501_1_11_N0090E12(del)	0.006	1180	240	481	44	01_1_12_N0097G03	0.014	4672	235	1982	45	01_1_13_N1030C19	0.201	3608	233	1720	44	01_1_14_N0345M21	-0.19	1641	232	575	43	01_1_15_N0281A03	0.03	5904	234	2487	45	01_1_16_N0771D21	null	230	231	41	42	-501_1_17_N0504D21	-0.112	3642	234	1389	43	01_1_18_N0490A23	0.24	5818	242	2829	44	01_1_19_M2112G04	null	231	236	42	43	-501_1_20_N0282F14	0.073	4496	240	1985	43	0!sample_table_end
