The sections were then deparaffinized with Xylene, processed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and stained with haematoxylin. Lasercapture microdissection for both lesions was performed at multiple sites using Veritas Arcturus. Cells were digested in 10ul TE, pH 9, and 0.5ul proteinase K (20mg/ml) for 48h at 55degC . After inactivation of proteinase K at 99degC  for 10min, the digest was stored at -20degC .  Without any further purification, the complete digest was used for whole genome amplification by means of the WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) kit from Sigma.!Sample_label_ch1 = Alexa Fluor 3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming according Invitrogens recommendation (Invitrogen BioPrime Total Genomic Labeling System).Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = reference - DNA pool isolated from laser captured microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy tissue.!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: mammary tissue without histomorphological changes obtained from reduction mammoplasty specimens!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Whole genome amplification by GenomePlex (Sigma).!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens cut at 7-8um were mounted on special foil-coated slides (Molecular Devices, San Diego, USA).

Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.15 and -0.15, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM368nnn/GSM368475/suppl/GSM368475.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14803!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio Cy3/Cy5 (subgrid lowess)#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	-0.062	1679	291	509	74	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	287	396	85	113	-1001_1_3_397B22	null	2876	497	1049	146	-1001_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	781	589	204	159	-1001_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	1711	903	185	176	-1001_1_6_F0488J12	null	1795	618	785	154	-501_1_7_N0413M21	null	590	287	168	71	-501_1_8_D2542F24	-0.075	1999	284	622	70	01_1_9_N0137H06	-0.008	1479	276	464	67	01_1_10_N0673B19	0.326	1488	291	592	74	01_1_11_N0090E12(del)	0.565	898	295	421	74	01_1_12_N0097G03	0.255	4075	274	1783	66	01_1_13_N1030C19	0.167	1641	267	589	66	01_1_14_N0345M21	-0.389	1029	271	245	66	01_1_15_N0281A03	-0.37	3888	276	1067	66	01_1_16_N0771D21	0.015	2584	271	892	66	01_1_17_N0504D21	-0.128	1851	264	544	65	01_1_18_N0490A23	-0.81	7342	275	1589	69	01_1_19_M2112G04	-0.185	1225	269	343	68	01_1_20_N0282F14	0.384	3040	261	1410	65	0!sample_table_end
