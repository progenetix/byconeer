The sections were then deparaffinized with Xylene, processed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and stained with haematoxylin. Lasercapture microdissection for both lesions was performed at multiple sites using Veritas Arcturus. Cells were digested in 10?l TE, pH 9, and 0.5?l proteinase K (20mg/ml) for 48h at 55?C. After inactivation of proteinase K at 99?C for 10min, the digest was stored at -20?C.  Without any further purification, the complete digest was used for whole genome amplification by means of the WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) kit from Sigma.!Sample_label_ch1 = Alexa Fluor? 3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming according Invitrogens recommendation (Invitrogen BioPrime? Total Genomic Labeling System).Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DNA pool isolated from laser captured microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy tissue.!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: mammary tissue without histomorphological changes obtained from reduction mammoplasty specimens!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Whole genome amplification by GenomePlex (Sigma).!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens cut at 7-8?m were mounted on special foil-coated slides (Molecular Devices, San Diego, USA).

Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.15 and -0.15, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454662/suppl/GSM454662_MC_8089_8090_r_Cy3_ILC_2135_Cy5_fpool_S33_300608.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14803!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log ratio (subgrid lowess)#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	null	935	267	1455	200	-1001_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	903	930	999	979	-1001_1_3_397B22	null	3937	1166	5593	1286	-1001_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	978	724	1078	739	-1001_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	775	490	4915	467	-1001_1_6_F0488J12	null	254	251	199	176	-1001_1_7_N0413M21	null	636	188	758	93	-1001_1_8_D2542F24	null	192	168	112	68	-501_1_9_N0137H06	0.038	453	160	532	56	01_1_10_N0673B19	null	153	153	53	48	-501_1_11_N0090E12(del)	0.054	308	147	299	44	01_1_12_N0097G03	-0.139	931	145	1082	38	01_1_13_N1030C19	0.14	710	143	973	35	01_1_14_N0345M21	-0.222	595	141	596	34	01_1_15_N0281A03	-0.307	1079	135	1189	32	01_1_16_N0771D21	null	140	134	29	30	-501_1_17_N0504D21	-0.428	699	138	620	32	01_1_18_N0490A23	-0.075	1435	138	1990	33	01_1_19_M2112G04	null	130	133	31	32	-501_1_20_N0282F14	0.042	811	137	1053	33	0!sample_table_end
