The sections were then deparaffinized with Xylene, processed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and stained with haematoxylin. Lasercapture microdissection for both lesions was performed at multiple sites using Veritas Arcturus. Cells were digested in 10ul TE, pH 9, and 0.5ul proteinase K (20mg/ml) for 48h at 55degC . After inactivation of proteinase K at 99degC  for 10min, the digest was stored at -20degC .  Without any further purification, the complete digest was used for whole genome amplification by means of the WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) kit from Sigma.!Sample_label_ch1 = Alexa Fluor 3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming according Invitrogens recommendation (Invitrogen BioPrime Total Genomic Labeling System).Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = reference - DNA pool isolated from laser captured microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy tissue.!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: mammary tissue without histomorphological changes obtained from reduction mammoplasty specimens!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Whole genome amplification by GenomePlex (Sigma).!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens cut at 7-8um were mounted on special foil-coated slides (Molecular Devices, San Diego, USA).

PMT settings: 100/100!Sample_description = Array CGH analysis of a female patient with pleomorphic/necrotic lobular intraepithelial neoplasia (LIN3) which was composed purely of apocrine cells. Corresponding resected tumor to Patient 2-1.!Sample_data_processing = TIFF images were analysed by Genepix 5.0 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and raw intensities (gpr files) were imported into CGHPRO (Chen at al.,2005).Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.15 and -0.15, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM368nnn/GSM368466/suppl/GSM368466.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14803!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio Cy3/Cy5 (subgrid lowess)#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	0.211	1080	248	525	63	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	387	265	101	79	01_1_3_397B22	-0.043	1873	245	782	63	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	627	245	153	66	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	1009	255	124	69	01_1_6_F0488J12	-0.122	4937	262	1962	76	01_1_7_N0413M21	0.137	471	252	176	72	01_1_8_D2542F24	0.077	1251	261	557	66	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.159	792	244	348	63	01_1_10_N0673B19	0.442	721	245	386	65	01_1_11_N0090E12(del)	0.105	808	249	342	66	01_1_12_N0097G03	0.55	2403	255	1533	65	01_1_13_N1030C19	0.074	1026	253	446	66	01_1_14_N0345M21	0.295	680	247	321	62	01_1_15_N0281A03	0.172	2179	247	1068	63	01_1_16_N0771D21	0.127	1781	247	837	62	01_1_17_N0504D21	0.148	1165	251	544	62	01_1_18_N0490A23	0.172	5616	252	2746	63	01_1_19_M2112G04	-0.02	914	251	361	62	01_1_20_N0282F14	0.065	1912	248	864	62	0!sample_table_end
