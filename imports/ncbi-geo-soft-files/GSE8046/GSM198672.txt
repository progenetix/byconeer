DNA was checked for purity using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and for excessive shearing by agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = An overview of Affymetrix SNP labeling protocol is available at: www.affymetrix.com. Briefly, tumor genomic DNA was subjected to restriction digestion by XbaI and the resulting fragments were ligated to adaptor sequences and PCR amplified. This PCR product was then fragmented by treatment with DNaseI, denatured to generate single stranded product and end-labeled by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase.!Sample_hyb_protocol = See "Pei, J., Kruger, W.D., and Testa, J.R.

High-resolution analysis of 9p loss in human cancer cells using single nucleotide polymorphism-based mapping arrays. Cancer Genet Cytogenet 170, 65-68." Briefly, The intensity of probe signals following hybridization to the GeneChip was determined using Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software v1.2. The Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool v2.1 was used to generate copy number calls for each of 57,290 discreet SNP markers, using the default genomic smoothing window setting of 0.5 Mb. Copy number (CN) calls were generated using the Affymetrix Dynamic Model.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Jay,,Johnson!Sample_contact_email = johnsja4@memorialhealth.com!Sample_contact_institute = Memorial Health University Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = 4700 Waters Ave!Sample_contact_city = Savannah!Sample_contact_state = GA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 31404!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM198nnn/GSM198672/suppl/GSM198672.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8046!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = Affymetrix SNP marker probe ID#JP-052205-50KXba-97-021_Call = Genotype#JP-052205-50KXba-97-021_SPA_CN = SPA copy number#JP-052205-50KXba-97-021_SPA_pVal = SPA p-value#VALUE = GSA Copy Number#JP-052205-50KXba-97-021_GSA_pVal = GSA p-value#JP-052205-50KXba-97-021_LOH = Likelihood that a SNP is in LOH state (closer to 1 indicates a strong likelihood of LOH)!sample_table_beginID_REF	JP-052205-50KXba-97-021_Call	JP-052205-50KXba-97-021_SPA_CN	JP-052205-50KXba-97-021_SPA_pVal	VALUE	JP-052205-50KXba-97-021_GSA_pVal	JP-052205-50KXba-97-021_LOHSNP_A-1677174	BB	1.45	-2.08	1.45	-2.08	1.66SNP_A-1678466	BB	1.4	-1.49	1.93	-1.78	1.66SNP_A-1676440	AA	1.55	-0.94	1.93	-1.79	1.66SNP_A-1662392	AA	2.5	0.93	1.81	-1.03	1.66SNP_A-1685736	AA	1.57	-1.06	1.81	-1.03	1.66SNP_A-1681384	BB	1.65	-1.12	1.81	-1.04	1.66SNP_A-1642581	BB	3.56	20	1.81	-1.13	1.66SNP_A-1669029	AA	1.35	-2.86	1.81	-1.13	1.66SNP_A-1718237	AA	1.16	-2.31	1.9	-1.78	1.66SNP_A-1748467	AA	1.55	-1.66	1.9	-1.78	1.66SNP_A-1705537	AB	2.3	0.86	2.17	0.57	0SNP_A-1683756	AB	2.59	2.29	2.17	0.57	0SNP_A-1696782	BB	2.21	0.48	2.3	0.89	0.2SNP_A-1673422	AB	1.56	-1.42	2.3	0.89	0SNP_A-1670878	BB	1.89	-0.5	2.13	0.31	1.25SNP_A-1743511	BB	3.26	3.73	2.13	0.31	1.25SNP_A-1736635	BB	1.69	-1.09	2.21	0.58	1.25SNP_A-1666738	BB	2.15	0.62	2.26	0.61	1.25SNP_A-1721407	AA	1.61	-0.93	2.15	0.31	1.25SNP_A-1686722	AA	2.65	1.69	2.15	0.32	1.25!sample_table_end
