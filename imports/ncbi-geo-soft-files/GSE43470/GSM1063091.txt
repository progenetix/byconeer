The chip was incubated at 49oC for 18 hours in the Affymetrix Genechip system hybridization oven!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP5.0!Sample_data_processing = Raw GenomeWideSNP_5 CEL files were pre-processed using PennCNV [Wang K, 2007]. This protocol extracts allele-specific signal intensities from genotyping arrays, and then integrates information on SNP spacing and SNP allele frequencies to generate CNV calls by a hidden Markov model (HMM) algorithm.!Sample_data_processing = PennCNV-Affy is a data-preprocessing protocol for Affymetrix genome-wide 5.0. The protocol converts raw CEL files into a signal intensity file that contains Log R Ratio (LRR) and B Allele Frequency (BAF) values.!Sample_data_processing = CNV data can be calculated from LRR (2*2^LRR).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6804!Sample_contact_name = Maxwell,,Lee!Sample_contact_email = leemax@mail.nih.gov!Sample_contact_phone = 240-2765239!Sample_contact_laboratory = Lab of Cancer Biology and Genetics!Sample_contact_department = CCR!Sample_contact_institute = National Cancer Institute, NIH!Sample_contact_address = Building 37, Room 5120!Sample_contact_city = Bethesda!Sample_contact_state = MD!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20814!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1063nnn/GSM1063091/suppl/GSM1063091_EC1877T.txt.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1063nnn/GSM1063091/suppl/GSM1063091_EC1877_tumor__GenomeWideSNP_5_.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE43470!Sample_data_row_count = 692404
