After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48Â¡C, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from PEA1 was genotyped using Illumina Infinium Human1M-Duo Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Data was processed in BeadStudio using the standard Illumina protocol.
