Outlier probes and probes with too low signal were detected and removed (set to NaN). [Note: (1) the two 'DNAPool vs maleControlDNA' replicates were averaged already on signal level to get more robust results (thus the processed log2(ratio)s for these two replicates are identical). (2) The normalized values of the random sequence probes (e.g. RANDOM00000001, RANDOM00000002 etc) were used to subtract the unspecific binding offsets and included in the full_normalized_data.txt file available on Series records.]!Sample_platform_id = GPL15436!Sample_contact_name = Michael,,Grau!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Oncology!Sample_contact_department = Faculty of Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of MÃ¼nster!Sample_contact_address = Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1!Sample_contact_city = MÃ¼nster!Sample_contact_state = Nordrhein-Westfalen!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 48149!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1059nnn/GSM1059800/suppl/GSM1059800_439528A02_2uM_532.pair.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1059nnn/GSM1059800/suppl/GSM1059800_439528A02_2uM_635.pair.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE43272!Sample_data_row_count = 719690
