Normal and tumour DNA was labelled by incubation with CyScribe Cy5 and Cy3 reactive dyes (Amersham Biosciences, UK).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was prepared for hybridisation to the Human BAC Array 1400 (Spectral Genomics, USA), according to the manufacturerâs instructions. In brief, DNA was combined with SG proprietary Hybridisation Buffer I and isopropanol precipitated. DNA was resuspended in 10 mL water and 60 mL Hybridisation Buffer II and hybridised at 37uC for 16 h in the presence of 26SSC, 50% formamide (pH 7.5). Arrays were washed sequentially in 26SSC/50% deionised formamide (pH 7.5), 26SSC/0.1% NP-40 (pH 7.5) and 0.2 SSC (pH 7.5) for 20, 20 and 10min, respectively. !Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned in an Axon 4000B scanner using GenePix v3.1 acquisition software (Molecular Devices, USA).!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = Spot data were median normalised, and included in the analysis only if the spot was flagged above background as calculated by GenePix before duplicate spot pairs were averaged, a single tumour/normal ratio of 1.2 was considered as gain and 0.8 as loss. !Sample_platform_id = GPL5015!Sample_contact_name = Gareth,,Price!Sample_contact_email = nscalehome@gmail.com!Sample_contact_phone = 61413289611!Sample_contact_institute = Queensland Facility for Advanced Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_address = Carmody Road!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_state = Queensland!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4072!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE7408!Sample_data_row_count = 3840#ID_REF = #Dia. = Spot Diameter, as determined by GenePix 3#F635 Median = Feature Signal of tumour DNA labelled with Cy5, as calculated by Genepix 3#B635 Median = Background Signal of tumour DNA labelled with Cy5, as calculated by Genepix 3#F532 Median = Feature Signal of normal DNA labelled with Cy3, as calculated by Genepix 3#B532 Median = Background Signal of normal DNA labelled with Cy3, as calculated by Genepix 3#F Pixels = Number of Feature pixels used in signal calculation#B Pixels = Number of Background pixels used in signal calculation#VALUE = Log2 ratio of [F635 Median - B635 Median] / [F532 Median - B532 Median]#F635 Median - B635 = F635 Median - B635 Median#F532 Median - B532 = F532 Median - B532 Median#Flags = Pass/fail status as determined by Genepix 3!sample_table_beginID_REF	Dia.
