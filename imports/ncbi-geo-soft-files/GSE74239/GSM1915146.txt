For samples with lymphocyte count >25K, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were separated using conventional Ficoll-Hypaque separation according to manufacturerâs instructions (StemCell Techonologies Inc, Vancouver, Canada).!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Tumor and saliva DNA were extracted using QIAamp Blood DNA (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA) and Oragene DNA (Oragene, Ontario, Canada) kits respectively, according to the manufacturerâs directions.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Samples for Affymetrix CytoScan HD arrays were labelled following fragmentation according to the manufacturerâs protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Standard protocols detailed by the manufacturer (Affymetrix Inc.) was used for array hybridization. The arrays were hybridized using the Hybridization Oven 645.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were scanned according to the standard protocol using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix Inc)!Sample_description = processed data file: SS190Final.txt!Sample_data_processing = Raw data was processed using the Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite [version -2.0.1.2 (r5919)], genome build hg19. Reference model file used was "CytoScanHD_Array.na32.3.v1.REF_MODEL" and the annotation file used was "CytoScanHD_Arra_na32.3.annot.db".!Sample_data_processing = A cutoff of 25 probes and 200kb (50 kb on gene overlapping regions) for deletion CNAs or 400kb (50 kb on gene overlapping regions) for gain CNAs was used.  A size cut off of 10 MB genome-wide and 3 MB within genic regions was used to detect LOH events. All CNAs and LOHs were manually reviewed. The TXT format file of the final data can be found in a tar archive on the series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Sunita,R,Setlur!Sample_contact_email = ssetlur@partners.org!Sample_contact_institute = Brigham and Women's Hospital!Sample_contact_address = 221 Longwood Avenue!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1915nnn/GSM1915146/suppl/GSM1915146_SS190_SALIVA_REPEAT_CytoScanHD_Array_.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE74239!Sample_data_row_count = 0
