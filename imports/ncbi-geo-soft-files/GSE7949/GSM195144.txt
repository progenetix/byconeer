Every 20th section was stained with H&E and only tissue from between levels revealing adequate amounts of tumor was used for further analysis.  The procedure ensured maximum concentration of tumor and minimum intervening stroma.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Test DNA was extracted from fresh frozen cut tissue sections with Proteinase K and was purified with Phase Lock gels using PCI (25 Phenol: 24 chloroform: 1 isoamyl alcohol) and CI (24 chloroform:1 isoamyl alcohol).  Precipitation of DNA was carried out wi!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA samples were hybridized in dye swap to the BAC-CGH array.  Labeling was carried out with either Cy3-dCTP or Cy5-dCTP using the BioPrime labeling Kit.  The reaction was cleaned with Qiagen MiniElute PCR kit.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = N0015DB1000!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Male Healthy donors!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Blood!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Periphereal Leukocytes!Sample_growth_protocol_ch2 = Serial sections were cut and preserved in eppendorff tubes (identified as to their origin between levels).

Arrays were hybridized with 50% deionized formamide, 2xSSC, 2% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate and 100Î¼g/Î¼l!Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned in a GenePix 4000B scanner and were analyzed with GenePix Pro 5.0 (Axon instruments, USA).!Sample_description = GOG0031!Sample_data_processing = Data was processed through print-tip normalization (lowess) and only consistent within slide and dye swap replicates (with distance to median < 0.4) were averaged and used for further analysis.  The log2 ratios were centered on the mean of each array and copy number aberration (CNA) was determined using a segmentation algorithm called Analysis of Copy Errors (ACE).!Sample_platform_id = GPL5338!Sample_contact_name = Carmen,Elisa,Oquendo!Sample_contact_email = oquendoc@mail.med.upenn.edu!Sample_contact_institute = University of Pennsylvania!Sample_contact_address = 421 Curie Blvd!Sample_contact_city = Philadelphia!Sample_contact_state = PA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 19119!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM195nnn/GSM195144/suppl/GSM195144_13423834_cv_1_1.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM195nnn/GSM195144/suppl/GSM195144_13423836_cv_1_1.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE7949!Sample_data_row_count = 5795
