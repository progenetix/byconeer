The fluidics station model FS450 was used.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were hybridized according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using an Affymetrix model 640 hybridization oven.!Sample_scan_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were scanned according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using a GS3000 scanner.!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix 500K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by dChip 2005 (Build date Nov 30, 2005) using the PM/MM difference model and invariant set normalization.  Forty-eight normal samples were downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=500k) and analyzed at the same time.  One CEL file for each set (Sty and Nsp) with the median signal intensity across the set was selected as the reference array.   The dChip-normalized signal intensities were converted to log2 ratios and segmented as follows.  For each autosomal probe set, the log2 tumor/normal ratio of each tumor sample was calculated using the average intensity for each probe set in the normal set.  For Chromosome X, the average of the 20 normal female samples was used.   Each probe set was mapped to the genome, NCBI assembly version 36, using annotation provided by the Affymetrix web site.  The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and segmented using the GLAD package for the R statistical environment.  GLAD segments composed of < 8 probesets were merged with the neighboring segment with the most similar copy number.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Jinfeng,,Liu!Sample_contact_email = liu.jinfeng@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics and Computational Biology!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way, MS93!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM640nnn/GSM640308/suppl/GSM640308_20356_HF-20931_Ovarytumors_SPR445_Map250kSty.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26075!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780358	1.48883736133575SNP_A-1780551	2.16434335708618SNP_A-1780357	1.46949970722198SNP_A-1780550	2.18750333786011SNP_A-1780352	1.51318490505219SNP_A-1780351	1.46854376792908SNP_A-1780350	2.12188601493835SNP_A-1780748	2.15178775787354SNP_A-1780747	1.50388288497925SNP_A-1780746	3.44334316253662SNP_A-1780745	2.15876173973083SNP_A-1780743	2.17783117294312SNP_A-1780549	1.47705435752869SNP_A-1780547	2.20653796195984SNP_A-1780541	1.46949970722198SNP_A-1780346	2.13084697723389SNP_A-1780345	2.13196611404419SNP_A-1780342	1.48503744602203SNP_A-1780341	2.13270783424377SNP_A-1780340	1.48918497562408!sample_table_end
