The fluidics station model FS450 was used.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were hybridized according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using an Affymetrix model 640 hybridization oven.!Sample_scan_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were scanned according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using a GS3000 scanner.!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix 500K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by dChip 2005 (Build date Nov 30, 2005) using the PM/MM difference model and invariant set normalization.  Forty-eight normal samples were downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=500k) and analyzed at the same time.  One CEL file for each set (Sty and Nsp) with the median signal intensity across the set was selected as the reference array.   The dChip-normalized signal intensities were converted to log2 ratios and segmented as follows.  For each autosomal probe set, the log2 tumor/normal ratio of each tumor sample was calculated using the average intensity for each probe set in the normal set.  For Chromosome X, the average of the 20 normal female samples was used.   Each probe set was mapped to the genome, NCBI assembly version 36, using annotation provided by the Affymetrix web site.  The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and segmented using the GLAD package for the R statistical environment.  GLAD segments composed of < 8 probesets were merged with the neighboring segment with the most similar copy number.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Jinfeng,,Liu!Sample_contact_email = liu.jinfeng@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics and Computational Biology!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way, MS93!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM640nnn/GSM640295/suppl/GSM640295_20361_HF-21298_Ovarytumors_SPR445_Map250kNsp.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26075!Sample_data_row_count = 262263#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780618	1.91413748264313SNP_A-1780617	1.88683593273163SNP_A-1780778	1.8640114068985SNP_A-1780616	1.99108541011810SNP_A-1780613	1.88170516490936SNP_A-1780419	2.03730678558350SNP_A-1780612	2.10994005203247SNP_A-1780418	2.00662851333618SNP_A-1780611	2.06574392318726SNP_A-1780610	2.25283551216125SNP_A-1780415	2.00662851333618SNP_A-1780576	2.03730678558350SNP_A-1780413	2.02399945259094SNP_A-1780412	1.92073583602905SNP_A-1780574	2.05690479278564SNP_A-1780379	1.91903877258301SNP_A-1780572	1.88734996318817SNP_A-1780378	2.18965530395508SNP_A-1780377	1.97464072704315SNP_A-1780570	2.02399945259094!sample_table_end
