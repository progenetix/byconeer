The fluidics station model FS450 was used.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were hybridized according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using an Affymetrix model 640 hybridization oven.!Sample_scan_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were scanned according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using a GS3000 scanner.!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix 500K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by dChip 2005 (Build date Nov 30, 2005) using the PM/MM difference model and invariant set normalization.  Forty-eight normal samples were downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=500k) and analyzed at the same time.  One CEL file for each set (Sty and Nsp) with the median signal intensity across the set was selected as the reference array.   The dChip-normalized signal intensities were converted to log2 ratios and segmented as follows.  For each autosomal probe set, the log2 tumor/normal ratio of each tumor sample was calculated using the average intensity for each probe set in the normal set.  For Chromosome X, the average of the 20 normal female samples was used.   Each probe set was mapped to the genome, NCBI assembly version 36, using annotation provided by the Affymetrix web site.  The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and segmented using the GLAD package for the R statistical environment.  GLAD segments composed of < 8 probesets were merged with the neighboring segment with the most similar copy number.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Jinfeng,,Liu!Sample_contact_email = liu.jinfeng@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics and Computational Biology!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way, MS93!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM640nnn/GSM640310/suppl/GSM640310_20360_HF-20996_Ovarytumors_SPR445_Map250kSty.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26075!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780358	2.01081204414368SNP_A-1780551	2.5741286277771SNP_A-1780357	2.09437155723572SNP_A-1780550	2.08843994140625SNP_A-1780352	1.95874440670013SNP_A-1780351	1.46617722511292SNP_A-1780350	2.09926748275757SNP_A-1780748	2.06539797782898SNP_A-1780747	2.24229097366333SNP_A-1780746	2.08211684226990SNP_A-1780745	1.46457290649414SNP_A-1780743	1.47671532630920SNP_A-1780549	1.45012140274048SNP_A-1780547	2.56772327423096SNP_A-1780541	1.44501185417175SNP_A-1780346	1.58124256134033SNP_A-1780345	2.07179689407349SNP_A-1780342	1.49027049541473SNP_A-1780341	2.0675311088562SNP_A-1780340	2.07237482070923!sample_table_end
