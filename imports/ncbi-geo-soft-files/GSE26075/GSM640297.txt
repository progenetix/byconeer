The fluidics station model FS450 was used.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were hybridized according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using an Affymetrix model 640 hybridization oven.!Sample_scan_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were scanned according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using a GS3000 scanner.!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix 500K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by dChip 2005 (Build date Nov 30, 2005) using the PM/MM difference model and invariant set normalization.  Forty-eight normal samples were downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=500k) and analyzed at the same time.  One CEL file for each set (Sty and Nsp) with the median signal intensity across the set was selected as the reference array.   The dChip-normalized signal intensities were converted to log2 ratios and segmented as follows.  For each autosomal probe set, the log2 tumor/normal ratio of each tumor sample was calculated using the average intensity for each probe set in the normal set.  For Chromosome X, the average of the 20 normal female samples was used.   Each probe set was mapped to the genome, NCBI assembly version 36, using annotation provided by the Affymetrix web site.  The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and segmented using the GLAD package for the R statistical environment.  GLAD segments composed of < 8 probesets were merged with the neighboring segment with the most similar copy number.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Jinfeng,,Liu!Sample_contact_email = liu.jinfeng@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics and Computational Biology!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way, MS93!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM640nnn/GSM640297/suppl/GSM640297_20365_HF-21664_Ovarytumors_SPR445_Map250kNsp.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26075!Sample_data_row_count = 262263#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780618	1.45955836772919SNP_A-1780617	1.45966851711273SNP_A-1780778	1.46033966541290SNP_A-1780616	1.46161699295044SNP_A-1780613	3.11627840995789SNP_A-1780419	1.46243023872375SNP_A-1780612	2.69224834442139SNP_A-1780418	2.09056758880615SNP_A-1780611	2.09919166564941SNP_A-1780610	1.51813006401062SNP_A-1780415	2.09056758880615SNP_A-1780576	1.46243023872375SNP_A-1780413	2.15309810638428SNP_A-1780412	2.14780235290527SNP_A-1780574	2.64687442779541SNP_A-1780379	1.45761811733246SNP_A-1780572	1.49635303020477SNP_A-1780378	2.14288163185120SNP_A-1780377	2.10932469367981SNP_A-1780570	2.15824913978577!sample_table_end
