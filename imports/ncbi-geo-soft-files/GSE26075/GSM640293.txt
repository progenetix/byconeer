The fluidics station model FS450 was used.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were hybridized according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using an Affymetrix model 640 hybridization oven.!Sample_scan_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were scanned according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using a GS3000 scanner.!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix 500K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by dChip 2005 (Build date Nov 30, 2005) using the PM/MM difference model and invariant set normalization.  Forty-eight normal samples were downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=500k) and analyzed at the same time.  One CEL file for each set (Sty and Nsp) with the median signal intensity across the set was selected as the reference array.   The dChip-normalized signal intensities were converted to log2 ratios and segmented as follows.  For each autosomal probe set, the log2 tumor/normal ratio of each tumor sample was calculated using the average intensity for each probe set in the normal set.  For Chromosome X, the average of the 20 normal female samples was used.   Each probe set was mapped to the genome, NCBI assembly version 36, using annotation provided by the Affymetrix web site.  The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and segmented using the GLAD package for the R statistical environment.  GLAD segments composed of < 8 probesets were merged with the neighboring segment with the most similar copy number.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Jinfeng,,Liu!Sample_contact_email = liu.jinfeng@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics and Computational Biology!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way, MS93!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM640nnn/GSM640293/suppl/GSM640293_20357_HF-20889_Ovarytumors_SPR445_Map250kNsp.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26075!Sample_data_row_count = 262263#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780618	1.9719078540802SNP_A-1780617	1.95586407184601SNP_A-1780778	1.98406887054443SNP_A-1780616	1.96402943134308SNP_A-1780613	1.96402943134308SNP_A-1780419	1.94733226299286SNP_A-1780612	2.44104075431824SNP_A-1780418	1.94548368453979SNP_A-1780611	1.9719078540802SNP_A-1780610	1.99792897701263SNP_A-1780415	1.94548368453979SNP_A-1780576	1.94733226299286SNP_A-1780413	1.96664953231812SNP_A-1780412	1.98654329776764SNP_A-1780574	1.98370110988617SNP_A-1780379	1.97880911827087SNP_A-1780572	1.95627760887146SNP_A-1780378	1.96275794506073SNP_A-1780377	1.97953641414642SNP_A-1780570	1.96664953231812!sample_table_end
