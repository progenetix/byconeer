The fluidics station model FS450 was used.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were hybridized according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using an Affymetrix model 640 hybridization oven.!Sample_scan_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were scanned according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using a GS3000 scanner.!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix 500K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by dChip 2005 (Build date Nov 30, 2005) using the PM/MM difference model and invariant set normalization.  Forty-eight normal samples were downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=500k) and analyzed at the same time.  One CEL file for each set (Sty and Nsp) with the median signal intensity across the set was selected as the reference array.   The dChip-normalized signal intensities were converted to log2 ratios and segmented as follows.  For each autosomal probe set, the log2 tumor/normal ratio of each tumor sample was calculated using the average intensity for each probe set in the normal set.  For Chromosome X, the average of the 20 normal female samples was used.   Each probe set was mapped to the genome, NCBI assembly version 36, using annotation provided by the Affymetrix web site.  The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and segmented using the GLAD package for the R statistical environment.  GLAD segments composed of < 8 probesets were merged with the neighboring segment with the most similar copy number.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Jinfeng,,Liu!Sample_contact_email = liu.jinfeng@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics and Computational Biology!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way, MS93!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM640nnn/GSM640316/suppl/GSM640316_20372_HF-21652_Ovarytumors_SPR445_Map250kSty.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26075!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780358	2.01376008987427SNP_A-1780551	1.99816560745239SNP_A-1780357	1.95671284198761SNP_A-1780550	1.99899291992188SNP_A-1780352	1.99537217617035SNP_A-1780351	1.98498749732971SNP_A-1780350	2.09043359756470SNP_A-1780748	1.98349010944366SNP_A-1780747	1.99044525623322SNP_A-1780746	1.99044525623322SNP_A-1780745	1.99830162525177SNP_A-1780743	1.99657285213470SNP_A-1780549	2.01376008987427SNP_A-1780547	1.98891186714172SNP_A-1780541	1.95671284198761SNP_A-1780346	2.00643944740295SNP_A-1780345	1.96051228046417SNP_A-1780342	2.00046896934509SNP_A-1780341	1.99713945388794SNP_A-1780340	1.98292922973633!sample_table_end
