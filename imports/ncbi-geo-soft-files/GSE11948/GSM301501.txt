Before the analysis, quality filtering tests (of both samples and SNPâs) were carried out to ensure a robust association test. The criteria for exclusion were: 1) call rate<90%, 2) minor allele frequency, MAF<5% and 3) deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with a low enough significance (p<0.00001). Sexual chromosomes were not considered in the SNP analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Maria,Eugenia,Sarasquete!Sample_contact_email = sarasquete@hotmail.com!Sample_contact_phone = 0034-923-291629!Sample_contact_fax = 0034-923-269066!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Biology!Sample_contact_department = Hematology!Sample_contact_institute = Hospital Universitario de Salamanca!Sample_contact_address = Paseo San Vicente 58-182!Sample_contact_city = salamanca!Sample_contact_state = salamanca!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 37007!Sample_contact_country = Spain!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM301nnn/GSM301501/suppl/GSM301501.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE11948!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype Call!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2188145	AASNP_A-1813205	ABSNP_A-1880143	AASNP_A-4215517	AASNP_A-1828242	AASNP_A-2029913	AASNP_A-1929900	ABSNP_A-1818663	AASNP_A-2192352	AASNP_A-4218271	AASNP_A-2253696	ABSNP_A-2033171	AASNP_A-2300162	ABSNP_A-2164807	BBSNP_A-2248065	ABSNP_A-2038351	AASNP_A-1793835	AASNP_A-2110739	BBSNP_A-1886977	ABSNP_A-4230926	AA!sample_table_end
