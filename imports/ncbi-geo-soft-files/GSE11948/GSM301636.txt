Before the analysis, quality filtering tests (of both samples and SNPâs) were carried out to ensure a robust association test. The criteria for exclusion were: 1) call rate<90%, 2) minor allele frequency, MAF<5% and 3) deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with a low enough significance (p<0.00001). Sexual chromosomes were not considered in the SNP analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Maria,Eugenia,Sarasquete!Sample_contact_email = sarasquete@hotmail.com!Sample_contact_phone = 0034-923-291629!Sample_contact_fax = 0034-923-269066!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Biology!Sample_contact_department = Hematology!Sample_contact_institute = Hospital Universitario de Salamanca!Sample_contact_address = Paseo San Vicente 58-182!Sample_contact_city = salamanca!Sample_contact_state = salamanca!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 37007!Sample_contact_country = Spain!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM301nnn/GSM301636/suppl/GSM301636.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE11948!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype Call!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-4296772	ABSNP_A-2133172	AASNP_A-1857705	ABSNP_A-2037516	NoCallSNP_A-2066049	BBSNP_A-4292034	BBSNP_A-2046219	AASNP_A-2000349	AASNP_A-1899331	AASNP_A-1831168	NoCallSNP_A-4278614	AASNP_A-4269346	ABSNP_A-1874310	ABSNP_A-4245737	BBSNP_A-4291787	NoCallSNP_A-2003316	NoCallSNP_A-4251673	ABSNP_A-4273236	BBSNP_A-2087801	ABSNP_A-2134163	AA!sample_table_end
