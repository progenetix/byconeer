Two Âµl of digested genomic DNA were run on a 0.8% agarose gel stained with SYBR SafeTM (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) to assess the completeness of digestion. The average size of fragments was between 200 and 500 bp. Digested DNA was concentrated to a final volume of 21 Âµl in a Concentrator 5301 (Eppendorf) at 30Â°C. DNA was labeled with Cy3-dCTP (Perkin Elmer, Wellesley, MA) using the Random-Primed Bioprime DNA Labeling kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Briefly, 50 ul reaction contained dATP, dGTP and dTTP (120 uM each), dCTP (60 uM) and Cy3-dCTP (60 uM). After incubation with Klenow Fragment (40 U) at 37Â°C for 2 hours, the enzyme was inactivate by heating at 65Â°C for 20 minutes. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed on Microcon YM-30 filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA) by using 1X TE (pH 8.0) buffer, according to manufacturerâs protocol. !Sample_source_name_ch2 = #501 tumor DNA !Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Human primary neuroblastoma tumor sample (frozen).!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = The surgically resected tumor was handled according to guidelines by the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Committee (Shimada H, Umehara S, Monobe Y, Hachitanda Y, Nakagawa A, Goto S, Gerbing RB, Stram DO, Lukens JN, Matthay KK. International neuroblastoma pathology classification for prognostic evaluation of patients with peripheral neuroblastic tumors: a report from the Children's Cancer Group. Cancer 2001;92:2451-61) and tumor cell content was evaluated. The sample was classified as "Neuroblastoma Schwannian stroma poor tumor" containing more than 80% malignant neuroblasts and having diploid DNA. According to the criteria of the International Neuroblastoma Staging System, the tumor was classified as stage 4 neuroblastoma. !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Total genomic DNA was extracted from the tumor sample according to Sambrook et al. (Sambrook J, Fritsch EF and Maniatis T: Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Second edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989)!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Two Âµg of test DNA were digested with AluI/RsaI restriction enzyme (5 U each) mix (Promega, Madison, WI) at 37Â°C for 2 hours in a ThermoStat heating block (Eppendorf). Two Âµl of digested genomic DNA were run on a 0.8% agarose gel stained with SYBR SafeTM (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) to assess the completeness of digestion. The average size of fragments was between 200 and 500 bp. Digested DNA was concentrated to a final volume of 21 Âµl in a Concentrator 5301 (Eppendorf) at 30Â°C. DNA was labeled with Cy5-dCTP (Perkin Elmer, Wellesley, MA) using the Random-Primed Bioprime DNA Labeling kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Briefly, 50 ul reaction contained dATP, dGTP and dTTP (120 uM each), dCTP (60 uM) and Cy5-dCTP (60 uM). After incubation with Klenow Fragment (40 U) at 37Â°C for 2 hours, the enzyme was inactivate by heating at 65Â°C for 20 minutes. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed on Microcon YM-30 filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA) by using 1X TE (pH 8.0) buffer, according to manufacturerâs protocol. !Sample_hyb_protocol = One ÂµL of labeled DNA was quantified using ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE) and the specific activity of the labeled DNA was calculated. One Âµg of each cyanine 5- and cyanine 3-labeled samples were mixed with 50 ug of human Cot-1 DNA and 100 ug of yeast tRNA (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and ethanol-precipitated. The solution was rinsed twice in cold 70% ethanol and air-dried. Ten ul of HybriBuffer A and 40 Âµl of HybriBuffer B (both supplied with the Eppendorf DualChipÂ® kit) were added to the dried labeled sample mixture, 50 Âµg of salmon sperm DNA (Eppendorf) and 100 Âµg of BSA (Promega). An appropriate volume of RNase-free water was added to bring a final volume of 100 Âµl. After denaturation at 95Â°C for 3 minutes, samples were pre-annealed at 37Â°C for 2 hours. Hybridization mixes were injected into hybridization frames according to the DualChipÂ® manual and slides (DualChipÂ® human cancer 1.1) were hybridized at 60Â°C for 12-16 hours in a ThermoMixer Plus (Eppendorf) with a mixing frequency of 1400 rpm. Washing steps were performed in glass dishes and with agitation according to the DualChipÂ® manual.!Sample_scan_protocol = Spot fluorescences were measured by using a G2565BA scanner (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) checking "flipping the tif-image", with 5 Âµm scan resolution, and both Red and Green PMTs set to 100%. !Sample_description = Images were processed by Adaptive method of QuantArrayÂ® 3.0 Analysis software (Perkin-Elmer) and mean signal and background intensities were calculated. !Sample_description = Probes for âinternal standardsâ, âpositive hybridization/orientation controlâ probes and âpositive biotin detection controlâ spots were excluded from the following analysis because they do not represent any genomic sequence. !Sample_data_processing = Spots with a Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) value < 2 on both channels were considered unreliable and were filtered out. Whenever a spot did not pass this criterion for only one channel, the spot was included in the analysis. The log-intensity of each spot was written as M = log2R - log2G (R and G: background-corrected red and green intensities for each spot). Log-intensity of each spot was written as A = Â½ (log2R + log2G), a measure of the overall brightness of the spot. Background-subtracted fluorescence log-ratios were normalized within each array by using loess normalization (Smyth, G.K. and T.P. Speed. 2003. Normalization of cDNA microarray data. Methods. 31(4): 265-273) available in Bioconductor Limma package (http://www.bioconductor.org; Smyth, G.K., Michaud, J., and H.S. Scott. 2005. Use of within-array replicate spots for assessing differential expression in microarray experiments. Bioinformatics. 21(9): 2067-2075), in order to correct the log-ratios for both spatial variation and intensity-based trends. The loess curve was constructed by a series of local regressions, one for each point in the MA-plot (Dudoit, S. Yang, Y.H., Callow, M.J., and T.P. Speed. 2002. Statistical methods for identifying differentially expressed genes in replicated cDNA microarray experiments. Statistica Sinica. 12: 111-140), for 120 invariant genes known to be not gained not lost in the tumor sample. !Sample_data_processing = A threshold method was then applied to automatically classify gene gains or losses (Scaruffi, P. Moretti, S., Coco, S., Mazzocco, K., Defferrari, R., Albino, D., Bonassi, S., and G.P. Tonini. 2006. Oligonucleotide array Comparative Genomic Hybridization profiling of neuroblastoma tumours. Cancer Genomics & Proteomics. 3: 245-252). In each array, the normalized ratios corresponding to the 120 reference genes were plotted to a normal quantile-quantile (QQ) plot to establish the threshold bounds for gain/loss assessment. Based on the proportion of ratios which lay on the line passing through the first and third quartiles in all QQ plots, for each array j, the two thresholds, c+j and câj, were computed, such that c+j = Meanj + StDevj and c-j = Meanj - StDevj where Meanj and StDevj were the mean and the standard deviation of ratio distribution of spots corresponding to the 120 control genes on the j-th array, respectively. Then, those probes whose ratio on each array j was greater than c+j were scored as gain. Conversely, those probes whose ratio on the array j was lower than the câj were scored as loss. Each gene was classified as lost or gained when at least 2 out of the 3 corresponding replicated probes were scored as loss or gain, respectively. !Sample_platform_id = GPL6745!Sample_contact_name = PAOLA,,SCARUFFI!Sample_contact_email = paola.scaruffi@hsanmartino.it!Sample_contact_laboratory = Center of Physiopathology of Human Reproduction!Sample_contact_institute = "San Martino" Hospital!Sample_contact_address = LARGO R.
