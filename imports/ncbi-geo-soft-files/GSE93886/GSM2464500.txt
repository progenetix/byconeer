RNA was qualityâcontrolled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50ng of DNA.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix Fluidics Stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScanHD array.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number analysis was done with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software version 2.1.0.16(r6634) and Annotation Net Affx Build 33. Interpretation was based on human reference sequence GRCh37/hg19, February 2009. The complete data set was visually analyzed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Granzow!Sample_contact_email = granzow@uni-heidelberg.de!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Heidelberg!Sample_contact_address = INF 366!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464500/suppl/GSM2464500_AML_98.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464500/suppl/GSM2464500_AML_98.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE93886!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.406344	0.200732	2.048833C-4WYLN	0.318002	0.275594	2.047471C-3BFNY	-0.108884	0.090216	2.047636C-7ONNE	0.116651	0.165571	2.047851C-6HYCN	0.150355	0.091444	2.049024C-7SCGC	-0.124998	0.167699	2.048836C-7RZQQ	0.160402	-0.016088	2.048729C-7RZWZ	0.118615	0.061324	2.048607C-7SEBI	0.094994	0.040339	2.048232C-7RZIL	-0.048623	0.118954	2.047444C-4NQTX	-0.250451	-0.064602	2.047364C-7SDKW	0.313803	0.015030	2.047301S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	-0.155908	-0.234158	2.047133C-4LHKS	-0.134288	-0.153935	2.046900C-7RWHE	-0.578149	-0.339642	2.047349C-7SBEJ	-0.118845	-0.259451	2.047400C-7RYJO	-0.262397	-0.087749	2.047079C-7SEGS	0.046855	-0.008369	2.047409C-4LLXK	-0.136363	-0.195544	2.047364!sample_table_end
