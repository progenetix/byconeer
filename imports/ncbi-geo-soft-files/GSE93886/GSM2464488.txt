RNA was qualityâcontrolled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50ng of DNA.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix Fluidics Stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScanHD array.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number analysis was done with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software version 2.1.0.16(r6634) and Annotation Net Affx Build 33. Interpretation was based on human reference sequence GRCh37/hg19, February 2009. The complete data set was visually analyzed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Granzow!Sample_contact_email = granzow@uni-heidelberg.de!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Heidelberg!Sample_contact_address = INF 366!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464488/suppl/GSM2464488_AML_70.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464488/suppl/GSM2464488_AML_70.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE93886!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.614304	0.337339	2.133021C-4WYLN	0.096614	0.260618	2.132850C-3BFNY	0.051231	0.281036	2.133917C-7ONNE	0.322525	0.205680	2.134762C-6HYCN	0.234701	0.123528	2.134599C-7SCGC	0.056353	0.050844	2.133897C-7RZQQ	0.086457	0.076621	2.134032C-7RZWZ	-0.118690	0.007828	2.133597C-7SEBI	-0.241196	0.164851	2.134346C-7RZIL	0.272789	0.101021	2.132365C-4NQTX	0.503806	0.133278	2.130035C-7SDKW	-0.060968	0.075284	2.130354S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	-0.116919	-0.224565	2.129479C-4LHKS	-0.314337	-0.276069	2.128701C-7RWHE	-0.178393	-0.240669	2.128562C-7SBEJ	-0.416959	-0.285304	2.128435C-7RYJO	-0.151007	0.009024	2.128265C-7SEGS	-0.031986	-0.028648	2.128961C-4LLXK	0.094779	0.006067	2.129918!sample_table_end
