RNA was qualityâcontrolled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50ng of DNA.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix Fluidics Stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScanHD array.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number analysis was done with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software version 2.1.0.16(r6634) and Annotation Net Affx Build 33. Interpretation was based on human reference sequence GRCh37/hg19, February 2009. The complete data set was visually analyzed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Granzow!Sample_contact_email = granzow@uni-heidelberg.de!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Heidelberg!Sample_contact_address = INF 366!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464484/suppl/GSM2464484_AML_62.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464484/suppl/GSM2464484_AML_62.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE93886!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.934772	0.436837	2.073147C-4WYLN	-0.006181	0.335237	2.074463C-3BFNY	0.169396	0.362231	2.076182C-7ONNE	0.299769	0.263446	2.076812C-6HYCN	0.144114	-0.052612	2.077019C-7SCGC	-0.002235	-0.145965	2.077224C-7RZQQ	-0.094768	-0.116774	2.077019C-7RZWZ	-0.564898	-0.202431	2.076766C-7SEBI	-0.433130	-0.116275	2.077912C-7RZIL	-0.259929	-0.192461	2.080827C-4NQTX	-0.065732	-0.169182	2.082278C-7SDKW	0.046154	-0.234717	2.084371S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	-0.286401	-0.217417	2.084824C-4LHKS	-0.788793	-0.271742	2.085128C-7RWHE	-0.027407	-0.272723	2.087014C-7SBEJ	0.024834	-0.315876	2.088163C-7RYJO	-0.283949	0.066371	2.090064C-7SEGS	0.246375	0.033814	2.091731C-4LLXK	-0.022573	-0.006501	2.095231!sample_table_end
