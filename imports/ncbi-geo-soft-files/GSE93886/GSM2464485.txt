RNA was qualityâcontrolled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50ng of DNA.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix Fluidics Stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScanHD array.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number analysis was done with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software version 2.1.0.16(r6634) and Annotation Net Affx Build 33. Interpretation was based on human reference sequence GRCh37/hg19, February 2009. The complete data set was visually analyzed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Granzow!Sample_contact_email = granzow@uni-heidelberg.de!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Heidelberg!Sample_contact_address = INF 366!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464485/suppl/GSM2464485_AML_65.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464485/suppl/GSM2464485_AML_65.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE93886!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.414215	0.323411	2.565116C-4WYLN	0.360758	0.363858	2.565546C-3BFNY	0.277082	0.401015	2.566637C-7ONNE	0.478452	0.442224	2.566663C-6HYCN	0.263983	-0.066684	2.566992C-7SCGC	-0.102260	-0.024078	2.566880C-7RZQQ	0.063259	0.025662	2.566599C-7RZWZ	-0.220002	0.070078	2.566995C-7SEBI	-0.081876	-0.027361	2.566201C-7RZIL	-0.173057	0.018967	2.568775C-4NQTX	0.214376	0.087696	2.572213C-7SDKW	0.255550	0.135693	2.572355S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	0.017646	0.032213	2.572734C-4LHKS	0.074658	0.081301	2.573761C-7RWHE	-0.230270	0.166286	2.573920C-7SBEJ	0.633368	0.215603	2.574584C-7RYJO	-0.339426	0.073295	2.575662C-7SEGS	0.241842	0.121777	2.576660C-4LLXK	0.226332	0.213133	2.578061!sample_table_end
