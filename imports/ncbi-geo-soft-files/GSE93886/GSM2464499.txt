RNA was qualityâcontrolled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50ng of DNA.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix Fluidics Stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScanHD array.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number analysis was done with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software version 2.1.0.16(r6634) and Annotation Net Affx Build 33. Interpretation was based on human reference sequence GRCh37/hg19, February 2009. The complete data set was visually analyzed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Granzow!Sample_contact_email = granzow@uni-heidelberg.de!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Heidelberg!Sample_contact_address = INF 366!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464499/suppl/GSM2464499_AML_95.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464499/suppl/GSM2464499_AML_95.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE93886!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.631905	0.305421	2.094656C-4WYLN	0.173858	0.264262	2.093479C-3BFNY	0.047720	0.260450	2.094549C-7ONNE	0.197859	0.221206	2.094852C-6HYCN	0.169989	0.028523	2.094358C-7SCGC	-0.237340	-0.007053	2.094502C-7RZQQ	0.071333	-0.013953	2.093846C-7RZWZ	-0.040866	-0.044397	2.094016C-7SEBI	0.035902	0.174962	2.093876C-7RZIL	0.010962	0.150700	2.092092C-4NQTX	0.427412	0.134135	2.090437C-7SDKW	0.102150	0.116624	2.089664S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	-0.125019	-0.090091	2.090004C-4LHKS	-0.088374	-0.100782	2.090125C-7RWHE	-0.286817	-0.133733	2.090593C-7SBEJ	0.037579	-0.138026	2.090049C-7RYJO	-0.457177	-0.064599	2.090325C-7SEGS	0.224259	-0.063334	2.090848C-4LLXK	-0.168736	-0.111895	2.090965!sample_table_end
