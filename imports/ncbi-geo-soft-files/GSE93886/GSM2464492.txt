RNA was qualityâcontrolled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50ng of DNA.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix Fluidics Stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScanHD array.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number analysis was done with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software version 2.1.0.16(r6634) and Annotation Net Affx Build 33. Interpretation was based on human reference sequence GRCh37/hg19, February 2009. The complete data set was visually analyzed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Granzow!Sample_contact_email = granzow@uni-heidelberg.de!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Heidelberg!Sample_contact_address = INF 366!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464492/suppl/GSM2464492_AML_79.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464492/suppl/GSM2464492_AML_79.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE93886!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	-0.003240	0.155558	1.998521C-4WYLN	0.161577	0.115721	1.999638C-3BFNY	0.062238	0.093574	1.999390C-7ONNE	0.198633	0.054356	1.999333C-6HYCN	0.168072	0.134694	1.999776C-7SCGC	0.011845	0.096721	1.999809C-7RZQQ	0.249758	0.060277	1.999224C-7RZWZ	-0.113797	0.024185	1.999099C-7SEBI	-0.026973	0.150782	1.998595C-7RZIL	0.246793	0.117207	1.998287C-4NQTX	0.327254	0.059009	1.998343C-7SDKW	-0.191523	0.028553	1.997783S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	0.104421	-0.091209	1.997987C-4LHKS	-0.069879	-0.117985	1.998500C-7RWHE	-0.531678	-0.194526	1.998608C-7SBEJ	-0.123747	-0.217156	1.998910C-7RYJO	0.003217	-0.407213	1.998990C-7SEGS	-0.790402	-0.425365	1.999607C-4LLXK	-0.596217	-0.507186	2.000486!sample_table_end
