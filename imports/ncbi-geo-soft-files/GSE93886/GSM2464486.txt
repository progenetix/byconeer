RNA was qualityâcontrolled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50ng of DNA.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix Fluidics Stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScanHD array.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number analysis was done with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software version 2.1.0.16(r6634) and Annotation Net Affx Build 33. Interpretation was based on human reference sequence GRCh37/hg19, February 2009. The complete data set was visually analyzed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Granzow!Sample_contact_email = granzow@uni-heidelberg.de!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Heidelberg!Sample_contact_address = INF 366!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464486/suppl/GSM2464486_AML_66.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464486/suppl/GSM2464486_AML_66.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE93886!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.158694	0.280477	2.157042C-4WYLN	0.310028	0.308215	2.155804C-3BFNY	0.196014	0.242735	2.155436C-7ONNE	0.437543	0.270851	2.154687C-6HYCN	0.343057	0.320066	2.154569C-7SCGC	0.224537	0.348927	2.153685C-7RZQQ	0.477414	0.265835	2.152892C-7RZWZ	0.185616	0.295794	2.152847C-7SEBI	0.057460	0.157413	2.152329C-7RZIL	0.284304	0.188788	2.153731C-4NQTX	0.256737	0.077129	2.154708C-7SDKW	-0.065002	0.110170	2.153786S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	-0.052967	-0.107172	2.153817C-4LHKS	0.065811	-0.072293	2.154128C-7RWHE	-0.431215	-0.213085	2.154512C-7SBEJ	-0.150505	-0.176321	2.155041C-7RYJO	-0.073362	-0.225767	2.155689C-7SEGS	-0.291386	-0.187222	2.155826C-4LLXK	-0.288959	-0.348313	2.156652!sample_table_end
