RNA was qualityâcontrolled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50ng of DNA.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix Fluidics Stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScanHD array.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number analysis was done with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software version 2.1.0.16(r6634) and Annotation Net Affx Build 33. Interpretation was based on human reference sequence GRCh37/hg19, February 2009. The complete data set was visually analyzed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Granzow!Sample_contact_email = granzow@uni-heidelberg.de!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Heidelberg!Sample_contact_address = INF 366!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464482/suppl/GSM2464482_AML_53.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464482/suppl/GSM2464482_AML_53.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE93886!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.300915	0.149493	2.028597C-4WYLN	0.124664	0.167055	2.028638C-3BFNY	-0.108064	0.060922	2.029895C-7ONNE	0.138884	0.078931	2.030196C-6HYCN	0.184217	0.158664	2.030120C-7SCGC	0.125409	0.177512	2.030182C-7RZQQ	0.139771	0.074219	2.029978C-7RZWZ	0.055211	0.094213	2.029852C-7SEBI	0.013977	0.104215	2.030207C-7RZIL	0.052028	0.125536	2.030741C-4NQTX	0.236662	0.026275	2.030973C-7SDKW	0.002308	0.048945	2.030664S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	-0.028959	-0.186318	2.031274C-4LHKS	-0.113816	-0.162443	2.031776C-7RWHE	-0.614108	-0.257273	2.032367C-7SBEJ	-0.081670	-0.232507	2.032795C-7RYJO	-0.248404	-0.032052	2.033900C-7SEGS	-0.084818	-0.006876	2.034301C-4LLXK	0.064878	-0.095489	2.034603!sample_table_end
