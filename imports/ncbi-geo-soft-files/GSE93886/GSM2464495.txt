RNA was qualityâcontrolled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50ng of DNA.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix Fluidics Stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScanHD array.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number analysis was done with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software version 2.1.0.16(r6634) and Annotation Net Affx Build 33. Interpretation was based on human reference sequence GRCh37/hg19, February 2009. The complete data set was visually analyzed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Granzow!Sample_contact_email = granzow@uni-heidelberg.de!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Heidelberg!Sample_contact_address = INF 366!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464495/suppl/GSM2464495_AML_82.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464495/suppl/GSM2464495_AML_82.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE93886!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.277692	0.265020	1.957371C-4WYLN	0.399216	0.306364	1.956145C-3BFNY	0.132774	0.211638	1.956647C-7ONNE	0.226522	0.253182	1.957365C-6HYCN	-0.074719	-0.130007	1.957362C-7SCGC	-0.311817	-0.088122	1.958106C-7RZQQ	-0.123658	-0.183655	1.957930C-7RZWZ	-0.032980	-0.141387	1.958733C-7SEBI	-0.176909	-0.056911	1.958516C-7RZIL	0.213095	-0.014382	1.959180C-4NQTX	0.182454	-0.112909	1.960290C-7SDKW	-0.473283	-0.070438	1.960127S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	-0.116992	-0.150265	1.959855C-4LHKS	-0.195796	-0.108382	1.960481C-7RWHE	-0.440236	-0.212995	1.961096C-7SBEJ	0.108921	-0.172463	1.961029C-7RYJO	-0.363223	-0.153151	1.962047C-7SEGS	-0.151394	-0.114960	1.963031C-4LLXK	-0.062628	-0.227493	1.963441!sample_table_end
