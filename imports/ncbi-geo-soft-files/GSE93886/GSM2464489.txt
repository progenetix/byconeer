RNA was qualityâcontrolled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50ng of DNA.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix Fluidics Stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScanHD array.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number analysis was done with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software version 2.1.0.16(r6634) and Annotation Net Affx Build 33. Interpretation was based on human reference sequence GRCh37/hg19, February 2009. The complete data set was visually analyzed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Granzow!Sample_contact_email = granzow@uni-heidelberg.de!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Heidelberg!Sample_contact_address = INF 366!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464489/suppl/GSM2464489_AML_72.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464489/suppl/GSM2464489_AML_72.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE93886!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.764012	0.459562	2.243931C-4WYLN	0.087686	0.416131	2.244976C-3BFNY	-0.051205	0.216860	2.246528C-7ONNE	0.467214	0.175154	2.247497C-6HYCN	0.464612	0.112829	2.247549C-7SCGC	0.113294	0.074436	2.247420C-7RZQQ	-0.152597	-0.117199	2.247365C-7RZWZ	-0.506151	-0.150908	2.247807C-7SEBI	-0.013106	0.150469	2.249173C-7RZIL	0.184911	0.122495	2.248525C-4NQTX	-0.000831	-0.058405	2.246933C-7SDKW	-0.036395	-0.079979	2.248020S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	-0.172052	-0.068965	2.247448C-4LHKS	-0.464161	-0.083878	2.246947C-7RWHE	-0.237969	-0.256527	2.247210C-7SBEJ	0.199898	-0.264918	2.247735C-7RYJO	0.428835	0.418939	2.248158C-7SEGS	0.345290	0.416566	2.248375C-4LLXK	0.335566	0.250271	2.250098!sample_table_end
