RNA was qualityâcontrolled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50ng of DNA.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix Fluidics Stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScanHD array.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number analysis was done with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software version 2.1.0.16(r6634) and Annotation Net Affx Build 33. Interpretation was based on human reference sequence GRCh37/hg19, February 2009. The complete data set was visually analyzed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Granzow!Sample_contact_email = granzow@uni-heidelberg.de!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Heidelberg!Sample_contact_address = INF 366!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464494/suppl/GSM2464494_AML_81.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464494/suppl/GSM2464494_AML_81.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE93886!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.174444	0.121745	2.039496C-4WYLN	0.043760	0.135599	2.040094C-3BFNY	0.153434	0.189299	2.040814C-7ONNE	0.279694	0.204689	2.040899C-6HYCN	0.112441	0.037997	2.040504C-7SCGC	0.077866	0.056366	2.040732C-7RZQQ	0.255039	0.106550	2.040697C-7RZWZ	-0.115273	0.129163	2.041096C-7SEBI	-0.147828	-0.083995	2.041495C-7RZIL	0.097776	-0.056119	2.042056C-4NQTX	0.158075	-0.014241	2.042671C-7SDKW	-0.242785	0.019594	2.042187S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	-0.297433	-0.229261	2.042680C-4LHKS	-0.259575	-0.189100	2.042587C-7RWHE	-0.083082	-0.163164	2.042672C-7SBEJ	-0.058107	-0.116672	2.043366C-7RYJO	-0.625875	-0.139018	2.042418C-7SEGS	0.007671	-0.086519	2.043907C-4LLXK	0.183062	-0.086365	2.045098!sample_table_end
