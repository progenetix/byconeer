RNA was qualityâcontrolled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50ng of DNA.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix Fluidics Stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScanHD array.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number analysis was done with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software version 2.1.0.16(r6634) and Annotation Net Affx Build 33. Interpretation was based on human reference sequence GRCh37/hg19, February 2009. The complete data set was visually analyzed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Granzow!Sample_contact_email = granzow@uni-heidelberg.de!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Heidelberg!Sample_contact_address = INF 366!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464481/suppl/GSM2464481_AML_50.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464481/suppl/GSM2464481_AML_50.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE93886!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.021915	0.093456	2.087462C-4WYLN	0.031571	0.133818	2.087018C-3BFNY	0.117313	0.061942	2.086348C-7ONNE	0.220915	0.102498	2.086223C-6HYCN	0.268009	0.108456	2.085918C-7SCGC	0.078796	0.149363	2.085973C-7RZQQ	0.043553	0.070825	2.085562C-7RZWZ	0.050464	0.112175	2.085351C-7SEBI	0.090221	0.158072	2.085899C-7RZIL	0.284306	0.199863	2.083412C-4NQTX	0.163368	0.113880	2.080991C-7SDKW	0.089917	0.155997	2.079496S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	-0.071752	-0.136500	2.079726C-4LHKS	0.044146	-0.094283	2.079831C-7RWHE	-0.412048	-0.181754	2.080474C-7SBEJ	-0.112665	-0.139777	2.080633C-7RYJO	0.128141	0.094840	2.080505C-7SEGS	0.042539	0.136140	2.079900C-4LLXK	0.050998	0.055610	2.080036!sample_table_end
