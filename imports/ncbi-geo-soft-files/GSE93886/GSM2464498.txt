RNA was qualityâcontrolled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50ng of DNA.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix Fluidics Stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScanHD array.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number analysis was done with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software version 2.1.0.16(r6634) and Annotation Net Affx Build 33. Interpretation was based on human reference sequence GRCh37/hg19, February 2009. The complete data set was visually analyzed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Granzow!Sample_contact_email = granzow@uni-heidelberg.de!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Heidelberg!Sample_contact_address = INF 366!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464498/suppl/GSM2464498_AML_94.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464498/suppl/GSM2464498_AML_94.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE93886!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.105208	0.096205	1.783820C-4WYLN	-0.108652	0.047544	1.784666C-3BFNY	-0.089890	0.035912	1.785238C-7ONNE	0.261015	-0.011986	1.785395C-6HYCN	-0.057276	-0.088630	1.785447C-7SCGC	-0.218050	-0.135014	1.785684C-7RZQQ	-0.072559	-0.155732	1.785323C-7RZWZ	-0.231340	-0.199849	1.785975C-7SEBI	0.098040	0.021864	1.785748C-7RZIL	0.084356	-0.019254	1.788256C-4NQTX	0.074219	-0.051071	1.790204C-7SDKW	-0.393569	-0.088487	1.790769S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	0.079252	-0.072748	1.791573C-4LHKS	-0.012202	-0.105795	1.792015C-7RWHE	-0.373215	-0.142643	1.792542C-7SBEJ	-0.185743	-0.170718	1.793025C-7RYJO	-0.785793	-0.625004	1.793871C-7SEGS	-0.571608	-0.647579	1.794207C-4LLXK	-0.421142	-0.681117	1.795486!sample_table_end
