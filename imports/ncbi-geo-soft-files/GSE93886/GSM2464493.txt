RNA was qualityâcontrolled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50ng of DNA.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix Fluidics Stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScanHD array.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number analysis was done with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software version 2.1.0.16(r6634) and Annotation Net Affx Build 33. Interpretation was based on human reference sequence GRCh37/hg19, February 2009. The complete data set was visually analyzed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Granzow!Sample_contact_email = granzow@uni-heidelberg.de!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Heidelberg!Sample_contact_address = INF 366!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464493/suppl/GSM2464493_AML_80.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464493/suppl/GSM2464493_AML_80.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE93886!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.743219	0.238294	2.069053C-4WYLN	-0.183580	0.180641	2.069793C-3BFNY	-0.070956	0.103184	2.072109C-7ONNE	0.082520	0.049079	2.072289C-6HYCN	0.398239	0.110773	2.072957C-7SCGC	0.059415	0.063508	2.073768C-7RZQQ	0.033477	-0.012270	2.074765C-7RZWZ	-0.378996	-0.049872	2.075360C-7SEBI	-0.127865	0.069445	2.075950C-7RZIL	-0.056069	0.043674	2.074885C-4NQTX	-0.006163	-0.035111	2.074239C-7SDKW	0.220433	-0.047674	2.074953S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	-0.231438	-0.199974	2.075402C-4LHKS	-0.567947	-0.198805	2.076011C-7RWHE	-0.383086	-0.290862	2.077253C-7SBEJ	0.216564	-0.276272	2.078347C-7RYJO	-0.331984	-0.084841	2.079876C-7SEGS	0.082340	-0.057927	2.081893C-4LLXK	-0.131463	-0.169734	2.083990!sample_table_end
