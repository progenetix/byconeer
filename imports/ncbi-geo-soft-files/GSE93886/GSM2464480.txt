RNA was qualityâcontrolled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50ng of DNA.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix Fluidics Stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScanHD array.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number analysis was done with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software version 2.1.0.16(r6634) and Annotation Net Affx Build 33. Interpretation was based on human reference sequence GRCh37/hg19, February 2009. The complete data set was visually analyzed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Granzow!Sample_contact_email = granzow@uni-heidelberg.de!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Heidelberg!Sample_contact_address = INF 366!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464480/suppl/GSM2464480_AML_49.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464480/suppl/GSM2464480_AML_49.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE93886!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.056243	0.056681	2.119725C-4WYLN	0.060781	0.131888	2.119361C-3BFNY	-0.102371	-0.043606	2.119035C-7ONNE	0.161687	0.031376	2.119018C-6HYCN	0.364285	0.084441	2.120080C-7SCGC	0.174429	0.158920	2.119930C-7RZQQ	-0.081919	-0.010718	2.120269C-7RZWZ	-0.161255	0.062893	2.120336C-7SEBI	-0.116415	0.087234	2.120732C-7RZIL	0.119752	0.159490	2.118172C-4NQTX	0.088876	0.000459	2.116523C-7SDKW	0.225700	0.070732	2.115956S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	-0.097300	-0.055542	2.115839C-4LHKS	0.034186	0.011987	2.115960C-7RWHE	-0.136152	-0.133422	2.115579C-7SBEJ	-0.047222	-0.069511	2.115568C-7RYJO	0.130685	0.135730	2.116066C-7SEGS	0.250163	0.195080	2.116146C-4LLXK	-0.031330	0.065559	2.116768!sample_table_end
