RNA was qualityâcontrolled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50ng of DNA.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix Fluidics Stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScanHD array.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number analysis was done with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software version 2.1.0.16(r6634) and Annotation Net Affx Build 33. Interpretation was based on human reference sequence GRCh37/hg19, February 2009. The complete data set was visually analyzed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Granzow!Sample_contact_email = granzow@uni-heidelberg.de!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Heidelberg!Sample_contact_address = INF 366!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464496/suppl/GSM2464496_AML_86.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464496/suppl/GSM2464496_AML_86.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE93886!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.546358	0.312789	1.964804C-4WYLN	0.115723	0.344866	1.965474C-3BFNY	0.061583	0.202957	1.966708C-7ONNE	0.373176	0.236227	1.967276C-6HYCN	0.025725	-0.023499	1.968026C-7SCGC	-0.099521	0.012059	1.968027C-7RZQQ	-0.115125	-0.137213	1.967197C-7RZWZ	-0.058166	-0.098434	1.967523C-7SEBI	0.144926	0.176930	1.967588C-7RZIL	0.243013	0.219613	1.967718C-4NQTX	0.071429	0.058466	1.968696C-7SDKW	0.101081	0.105439	1.968889S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	0.072766	-0.122458	1.969229C-4LHKS	-0.110253	-0.071150	1.969159C-7RWHE	-0.503323	-0.243316	1.969450C-7SBEJ	-0.084093	-0.187976	1.970284C-7RYJO	-0.253665	-0.137292	1.970845C-7SEGS	-0.272727	-0.078581	1.970965C-4LLXK	-0.038337	-0.254335	1.971536!sample_table_end
