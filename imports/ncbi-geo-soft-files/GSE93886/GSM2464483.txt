RNA was qualityâcontrolled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50ng of DNA.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix Fluidics Stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScanHD array.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number analysis was done with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software version 2.1.0.16(r6634) and Annotation Net Affx Build 33. Interpretation was based on human reference sequence GRCh37/hg19, February 2009. The complete data set was visually analyzed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Granzow!Sample_contact_email = granzow@uni-heidelberg.de!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Heidelberg!Sample_contact_address = INF 366!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464483/suppl/GSM2464483_AML_60.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464483/suppl/GSM2464483_AML_60.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE93886!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.667755	0.348045	2.110255C-4WYLN	0.052496	0.297038	2.109892C-3BFNY	0.116121	0.265180	2.110426C-7ONNE	0.290058	0.216166	2.110766C-6HYCN	0.413089	0.035321	2.109923C-7SCGC	-0.002839	-0.009892	2.110203C-7RZQQ	-0.057195	-0.031057	2.110141C-7RZWZ	-0.429668	-0.070985	2.110323C-7SEBI	-0.220379	-0.013258	2.111029C-7RZIL	-0.116790	-0.046865	2.108797C-4NQTX	0.153740	-0.055088	2.107689C-7SDKW	-0.013646	-0.081863	2.108479S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	-0.434329	-0.190864	2.107753C-4LHKS	-0.223238	-0.210823	2.107273C-7RWHE	-0.440794	-0.215944	2.106944C-7SBEJ	0.251139	-0.229600	2.107203C-7RYJO	-0.267474	-0.006426	2.106807C-7SEGS	-0.002503	-0.014702	2.106740C-4LLXK	0.085776	-0.033602	2.106982!sample_table_end
