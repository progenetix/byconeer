RNA was qualityâcontrolled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50ng of DNA.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix Fluidics Stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScanHD array.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number analysis was done with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software version 2.1.0.16(r6634) and Annotation Net Affx Build 33. Interpretation was based on human reference sequence GRCh37/hg19, February 2009. The complete data set was visually analyzed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Granzow!Sample_contact_email = granzow@uni-heidelberg.de!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Heidelberg!Sample_contact_address = INF 366!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464478/suppl/GSM2464478_AML_13.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464478/suppl/GSM2464478_AML_13.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE93886!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.349121	0.288652	2.103745C-4WYLN	0.218622	0.312089	2.103950C-3BFNY	0.125772	0.206649	2.104675C-7ONNE	0.345439	0.231563	2.105761C-6HYCN	0.468916	0.351526	2.105320C-7SCGC	0.345925	0.379282	2.105124C-7RZQQ	0.453201	0.266731	2.104908C-7RZWZ	0.027995	0.298501	2.104595C-7SEBI	0.158089	0.245288	2.104531C-7RZIL	0.278772	0.281972	2.106031C-4NQTX	0.444722	0.157192	2.106671C-7SDKW	0.002217	0.199343	2.106560S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	-0.240126	-0.026320	2.106815C-4LHKS	0.144125	0.021501	2.107169C-7RWHE	-0.167794	-0.116266	2.107307C-7SBEJ	0.079762	-0.062946	2.108425C-7RYJO	0.016757	0.023715	2.108650C-7SEGS	0.213098	0.082026	2.109566C-4LLXK	-0.346443	-0.062794	2.110954!sample_table_end
