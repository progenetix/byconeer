RNA was qualityâcontrolled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50ng of DNA.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix Fluidics Stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScanHD array.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number analysis was done with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software version 2.1.0.16(r6634) and Annotation Net Affx Build 33. Interpretation was based on human reference sequence GRCh37/hg19, February 2009. The complete data set was visually analyzed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Granzow!Sample_contact_email = granzow@uni-heidelberg.de!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Heidelberg!Sample_contact_address = INF 366!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464479/suppl/GSM2464479_AML_40.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464479/suppl/GSM2464479_AML_40.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE93886!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.402406	0.163133	2.006866C-4WYLN	-0.143362	0.138870	2.007466C-3BFNY	-0.020695	0.180580	2.008073C-7ONNE	0.402124	0.157889	2.008119C-6HYCN	0.389456	0.193944	2.007821C-7SCGC	0.078822	0.174295	2.007827C-7RZQQ	0.195499	0.208321	2.008000C-7RZWZ	0.105808	0.193024	2.007586C-7SEBI	0.025497	0.062896	2.007705C-7RZIL	0.022721	0.053016	2.010508C-4NQTX	0.185420	0.072758	2.012536C-7SDKW	0.024092	0.069061	2.011762S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	-0.251247	-0.111235	2.012654C-4LHKS	-0.082338	-0.108313	2.013424C-7RWHE	-0.195471	-0.106647	2.014272C-7SBEJ	0.105844	-0.097018	2.014980C-7RYJO	-0.176287	-0.231225	2.016158C-7SEGS	-0.267793	-0.215148	2.017071C-4LLXK	-0.196711	-0.229635	2.018433!sample_table_end
