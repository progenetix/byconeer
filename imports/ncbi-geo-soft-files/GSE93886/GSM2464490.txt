RNA was qualityâcontrolled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50ng of DNA.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix Fluidics Stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScanHD array.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number analysis was done with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software version 2.1.0.16(r6634) and Annotation Net Affx Build 33. Interpretation was based on human reference sequence GRCh37/hg19, February 2009. The complete data set was visually analyzed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Granzow!Sample_contact_email = granzow@uni-heidelberg.de!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Heidelberg!Sample_contact_address = INF 366!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464490/suppl/GSM2464490_AML_76.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464490/suppl/GSM2464490_AML_76.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE93886!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.286626	0.205097	2.050163C-4WYLN	0.198209	0.177589	2.049735C-3BFNY	0.049757	0.128286	2.049702C-7ONNE	0.077794	0.101415	2.049023C-6HYCN	0.342216	0.069714	2.047659C-7SCGC	-0.135864	0.044021	2.047494C-7RZQQ	-0.032644	-0.006789	2.047219C-7RZWZ	-0.097692	-0.030935	2.046900C-7SEBI	0.099168	0.247939	2.046205C-7RZIL	-0.010909	0.225466	2.045489C-4NQTX	0.193851	0.169464	2.044325C-7SDKW	0.509291	0.148525	2.043129S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	0.150490	0.066152	2.043039C-4LHKS	-0.058592	0.046337	2.042918C-7RWHE	-0.251738	-0.017537	2.042103C-7SBEJ	0.217934	-0.036858	2.042275C-7RYJO	0.253273	0.160509	2.042398C-7SEGS	0.085642	0.140879	2.040941C-4LLXK	-0.053713	0.074212	2.040610!sample_table_end
