RNA was qualityâcontrolled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50ng of DNA.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix Fluidics Stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScanHD array.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number analysis was done with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software version 2.1.0.16(r6634) and Annotation Net Affx Build 33. Interpretation was based on human reference sequence GRCh37/hg19, February 2009. The complete data set was visually analyzed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Granzow!Sample_contact_email = granzow@uni-heidelberg.de!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Heidelberg!Sample_contact_address = INF 366!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464487/suppl/GSM2464487_AML_69.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464487/suppl/GSM2464487_AML_69.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE93886!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.505443	0.177103	2.106009C-4WYLN	-0.374405	0.119387	2.107326C-3BFNY	0.235409	0.199937	2.108908C-7ONNE	0.275506	0.145533	2.109491C-6HYCN	0.327744	0.140761	2.108853C-7SCGC	0.027177	0.092759	2.108917C-7RZQQ	0.126749	0.147447	2.109108C-7RZWZ	0.007840	0.108543	2.109552C-7SEBI	0.054456	0.006488	2.109493C-7RZIL	-0.097512	-0.021177	2.110139C-4NQTX	-0.037934	-0.013597	2.111893C-7SDKW	0.024173	-0.028532	2.112410S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	-0.105372	-0.034603	2.112868C-4LHKS	-0.181543	-0.036002	2.112653C-7RWHE	-0.306927	-0.089485	2.113440C-7SBEJ	0.356561	-0.077199	2.113930C-7RYJO	-0.149615	0.012945	2.114942C-7SEGS	0.230793	0.038476	2.115638C-4LLXK	-0.109396	-0.080645	2.117116!sample_table_end
