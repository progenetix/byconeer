RNA was qualityâcontrolled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50ng of DNA.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix Fluidics Stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScanHD array.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number analysis was done with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) software version 2.1.0.16(r6634) and Annotation Net Affx Build 33. Interpretation was based on human reference sequence GRCh37/hg19, February 2009. The complete data set was visually analyzed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Granzow!Sample_contact_email = granzow@uni-heidelberg.de!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Heidelberg!Sample_contact_address = INF 366!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464497/suppl/GSM2464497_AML_89.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2464nnn/GSM2464497/suppl/GSM2464497_AML_89.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE93886!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.106192	0.196278	1.911710C-4WYLN	0.275630	0.205796	1.910809C-3BFNY	0.120579	0.133227	1.911092C-7ONNE	0.176900	0.144000	1.911590C-6HYCN	0.278851	0.025271	1.911682C-7SCGC	-0.288539	0.038411	1.911541C-7RZQQ	0.190001	-0.037427	1.911127C-7RZWZ	-0.175136	-0.021076	1.911003C-7SEBI	-0.107628	0.024661	1.910348C-7RZIL	0.225855	0.044686	1.912266C-4NQTX	0.229528	-0.031883	1.914457C-7SDKW	-0.318473	-0.008181	1.913974S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	-0.050853	-0.169899	1.914343C-4LHKS	0.124272	-0.142987	1.914765C-7RWHE	-0.532487	-0.210196	1.914736C-7SBEJ	-0.245037	-0.181021	1.914805C-7RYJO	-0.655672	-0.236766	1.915551C-7SEGS	0.036350	-0.206678	1.915786C-4LLXK	-0.285293	-0.251116	1.917446!sample_table_end
