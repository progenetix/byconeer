Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	13130	132	20353.5	153.5	-0.440887	0	-0.2788522	13388	138	20193	166	-0.413084	0	-0.2788523	14117	205	20669	220	-0.385182	0	-0.2788524	10083.5	206	15338	199.5	-0.426982	0	-0.3070255	9705	234	14702	234	-0.423705	0	-0.3070256	9131	220	13700	226	-0.413475	0	-0.3070257	13072	222	19605.5	204	-0.412007	0	-0.3424098	12732.5	256	19534.5	284	-0.43369	0	-0.3424099	12300	273.5	17956	259.5	-0.386254	0	-0.34240910	10741	253	13873	257	-0.261014	0	-0.30702511	11359	238	14391	255	-0.23989	0	-0.30702512	11078	239.5	14537.5	260.5	-0.275545	0	-0.30702513	20799.5	244	27687	286	-0.287451	0	-0.22679414	20749.5	266	27234	286	-0.274289	0	-0.22679415	19877	263	26656.5	236	-0.297897	0	-0.22679416	20812	296.5	26782.5	247	-0.257303	0	-0.23265517	20612	273	27114	294.5	-0.276589	0	-0.23265518	20777	274	26860	247	-0.260829	0	-0.23265519	22523	154	28852	203	-0.247442	0	-0.22679420	22585.5	182.5	27857.5	182.5	-0.211335	0	-0.226794!sample_table_end
