Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 17328#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	2674	203	6226.5	175	-0.895683	0	-1.1756922	2414	224	6248	179	-1.019292	0	-1.1756923	2533	230	6629.5	178	-1.0301	0	-1.1756924	1941	235	8425	183	-1.575092	0	-1.3926385	1870.5	243	8094	180	-1.581588	0	-1.3926386	3030	258	10739	204	-1.335134	0	-1.3926387	3351.5	251	8624	189	-1.000826	0	-1.1756928	2922	253	7565	180.5	-1.017679	0	-1.1756929	2565.5	256	6679	181.5	-1.034386	0	-1.17569210	1914	257	5224	186.5	-1.111901	0	-1.25348711	1886	260	5180.5	190	-1.121413	0	-1.25348712	1910	266	5297	193	-1.132892	0	-1.25348713	869	264	1702.5	184	-0.92025	0	-1.17569214	830	247	1679	186	-0.940356	0	-1.17569215	844	246.5	1843	195	-1.014563	0	-1.17569216	2157	266	5817	194	-1.08976	0	-1.39263817	2298	268	6157.5	194	-1.077622	0	-1.39263818	2234.5	279	6188.5	192	-1.12053	0	-1.39263819	2278.5	286	5203	188	-0.923043	0	-1.17569220	2619	206	5646	179	-0.817859	0	-1.175692!sample_table_end
