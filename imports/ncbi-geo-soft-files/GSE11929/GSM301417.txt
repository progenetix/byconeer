Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	3947	243	4236.5	130	-0.103158	0	0.0958632	4158	253	4361	131	-0.079944	0	0.0958633	4239	246.5	4532	131	-0.097414	0	0.0958634	3319	253	3789	132	-0.176269	0	0.1250315	3364	248	3742.5	130	-0.14785	0	0.1250316	3217.5	235	3689	128	-0.17728	0	0.1250317	2803	227	3845	127	-0.366948	0	-0.06718	2723	222	3655	127	-0.34404	0	-0.06719	2786	227.5	4020	130	-0.418988	0	-0.067110	2761	253	2529	129	0.044017	0	0.12503111	2712.5	296	2370	132	0.076738	0	0.12503112	2729	235.5	2650.5	130	-0.01077	0	0.12503113	4597	222	4255	133	0.059568	0	0.26256314	4728	228	4243	133	0.090654	0	0.26256315	4813	241.5	4272.5	136	0.099991	0	0.26256316	4609	221	4594	135	-0.016051	0	0.09823417	4416	241	4466	135	-0.036684	0	0.09823418	4353.5	241	4409	138.5	-0.0377	0	0.09823419	5194	251	4566	133	0.108896	0	0.26256320	4944	266	4080.5	134	0.170042	0	0.262563!sample_table_end
