Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	4301	221.5	4638	159	-0.093425	0	-0.0618292	4671.5	196	5248	151	-0.130034	0	-0.0618293	4941	157	6046	161	-0.20713	0	-0.0618294	3997	159	4806	170	-0.188901	0	-0.0872825	5085	159	6372.5	168	-0.230748	0	-0.0872826	4099.5	163	4934.5	167	-0.19153	0	-0.0872827	4651	150	5551	146.5	-0.182932	0	-0.0879548	4857	153.5	5802	155	-0.182818	0	-0.0879549	4603	169	5204	160	-0.128897	0	-0.08795410	3292	178	3390	173	-0.032541	0	-0.09393311	3118	186	3306	181	-0.063749	0	-0.09393312	3178	186	3380	186	-0.065332	0	-0.09393313	4823.5	169.5	5525	189	-0.136749	0	-0.07633514	4829	169	5281	182	-0.090029	0	-0.07633515	4794	176	5471	169	-0.138122	0	-0.07633516	5494	177	5856	187	-0.064104	0	-0.04044417	5825	177	6302	192.5	-0.078543	0	-0.04044418	5717	169	5933.5	182	-0.036023	0	-0.04044419	5649	242	5781.5	161	-0.038726	0	-0.07633520	6222.5	260	6543	159	-0.068305	0	-0.076335!sample_table_end
