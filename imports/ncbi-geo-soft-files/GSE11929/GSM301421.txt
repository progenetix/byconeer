Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	9729	415.5	17004	120.5	-0.594872	0	-0.3764082	9410	441	17159	115	-0.642024	0	-0.3764083	9724	513	18012	144	-0.662613	0	-0.3764084	8061	487	15267	128	-0.692553	0	-0.4050215	8011.5	505	15833.5	136	-0.737732	0	-0.4050216	8270	538	16190	145	-0.73003	0	-0.4050217	10031	565	18900	137	-0.68418	0	-0.4305228	9943	564	19195.5	105.5	-0.710691	0	-0.4305229	9520	548	17626	150	-0.66672	0	-0.43052210	9238	699	13468	201	-0.440636	0	-0.40502111	9205.5	693	13195.5	179	-0.424682	0	-0.40502112	9009	642	13867	169	-0.492954	0	-0.40502113	12991	728	19960	209.5	-0.476592	0	-0.30676214	14037.5	730	20540.5	209.5	-0.423819	0	-0.30676215	13881	732	21574.5	203	-0.485713	0	-0.30676216	19810	751	25168	213	-0.269535	0	-0.09399117	19263	732	25426	221	-0.307597	0	-0.09399118	18907	644	25214.5	219	-0.313819	0	-0.09399119	16511.5	424.5	23778	103	-0.386408	0	-0.30676220	15137	477	22266	92	-0.413798	0	-0.306762!sample_table_end
