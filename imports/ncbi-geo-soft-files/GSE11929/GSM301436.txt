Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	2812	231	4237	154	-0.458655	0	-0.3151182	3012	254	4535	159	-0.461629	0	-0.3151183	2804.5	239	4160	139	-0.449377	0	-0.3151184	2523	214	3838	131	-0.473408	0	-0.3072575	2547.5	203.5	3824	135	-0.453497	0	-0.3072576	2891	211	4469.5	137.5	-0.480213	0	-0.3072577	3697	208	4698	142	-0.26683	0	-0.1608338	3667	197	4724	136	-0.27929	0	-0.1608339	3736.5	199	4793	136	-0.274951	0	-0.16083310	2381	206	3379.5	137	-0.399316	0	-0.30725711	2228.5	181	3176	132	-0.396553	0	-0.30725712	2379	185	3467	131	-0.419046	0	-0.30725713	4079	179	4978	125	-0.218621	0	-0.16378114	4177	180	5188	125	-0.236415	0	-0.16378115	4076	170	5104	126	-0.242514	0	-0.16378116	4433	156	5707	126	-0.266116	0	-0.18539317	4342.5	133	5689	128.5	-0.278344	0	-0.18539318	4228.5	146	5451.5	127	-0.265609	0	-0.18539319	3043	265	3867	206	-0.276005	0	-0.16378120	3108	263	3673	174	-0.206914	0	-0.163781!sample_table_end
