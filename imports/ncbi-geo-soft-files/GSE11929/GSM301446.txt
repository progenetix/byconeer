Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	3434	250	4320	140	-0.272173	0	0.0289412	3558	271.5	4529	151	-0.286769	0	0.0289413	3385	278	4334.5	165	-0.294138	0	0.0289414	2862	281	3914	173	-0.371176	0	0.0192575	2855	285	3910	140	-0.383169	0	0.0192576	2950	288	3904	138	-0.346936	0	0.0192577	3517.5	299.5	4425	142	-0.285894	0	0.0752988	3461	322	4196	143	-0.255553	0	0.0752989	3419	341.5	4136	142	-0.260676	0	0.07529810	2882.5	344	3156	138	-0.173021	0	0.01925711	2802.5	348	3166.5	142.5	-0.208657	0	0.01925712	2670	294	2923	141	-0.157752	0	0.01925713	4116	291	4472	143	-0.123778	0	0.04709914	4053	304	4577	144	-0.167587	0	0.04709915	4270.5	304	4580	146	-0.111418	0	0.04709916	4446.5	312	4492	148	-0.049429	0	0.07529817	4680	367	4571	155	-0.023601	0	0.07529818	4850	434.5	4387	164	0.044575	0	0.07529819	3871	281	4632	143	-0.223478	0	0.04709920	3765	309	4563	147	-0.245122	0	0.047099!sample_table_end
