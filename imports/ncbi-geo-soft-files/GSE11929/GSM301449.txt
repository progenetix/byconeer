Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 17328#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	2626	131	3398.5	146	-0.265135	0	-0.0959012	2515.5	137	3034	194.5	-0.177158	0	-0.0959013	2495.5	124	2907	153	-0.149532	0	-0.0959014	3016	134	3353	135	-0.110276	0	-0.0575565	2984	133	3383	136	-0.130062	0	-0.0575566	3048.5	127	3296.5	139	-0.077683	0	-0.0575567	3043	124	3562	139	-0.159276	0	-0.0959018	3020.5	138	3443	139	-0.136476	0	-0.0959019	2764	150	3141	141	-0.137731	0	-0.09590110	1628	151	2016	143	-0.237528	0	-0.07798211	1767	144	1997.5	144	-0.132799	0	-0.07798212	1720	155	1990.5	142	-0.166489	0	-0.07798213	1175	148	1363	146	-0.169747	0	-0.09590114	1042	137	1278.5	159	-0.212702	0	-0.09590115	1138	138	1358	180	-0.163818	0	-0.09590116	2191	163	2456	189	-0.111407	0	-0.07798217	2157.5	169	2423.5	181	-0.120211	0	-0.07798218	2263	183	2643.5	167	-0.174478	0	-0.07798219	2711.5	193	3051	160	-0.137939	0	-0.09590120	2754	133	3508	141	-0.250466	0	-0.095901!sample_table_end
