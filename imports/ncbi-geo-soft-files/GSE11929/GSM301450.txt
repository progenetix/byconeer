Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	16086	282	19541	151	-0.204494	0	-0.2257272	15147	317	18475.5	128	-0.212841	0	-0.2257273	17716.5	335	21993	148	-0.228566	0	-0.2257274	10178.5	295.5	18300	142	-0.608295	0	-0.3526335	10207.5	272	17943	145	-0.582972	0	-0.3526336	10561	306	17716	131	-0.539281	0	-0.3526337	19074.5	367	22761	158	-0.189158	0	-0.2255638	18567	355	22672	191.5	-0.210568	0	-0.2255639	18067	391	22783	206	-0.244724	0	-0.22556310	13944	367	15884.5	178.5	-0.145666	0	-0.24194611	12490	401	15354.5	170	-0.227979	0	-0.24194612	13454	373	15997	169	-0.19062	0	-0.24194613	23387.5	406	25750.5	207	-0.105693	0	-0.18975214	22744	393	26548	207	-0.164256	0	-0.18975215	23179	460.5	28032	202	-0.202935	0	-0.18975216	26689.5	395.5	29807	227	-0.117758	0	-0.20451817	26098	453	29210	203.5	-0.123171	0	-0.20451818	26984	515.5	31008.5	223	-0.151088	0	-0.20451819	23713	368	24890	119	-0.059291	0	-0.18975220	22681	339.5	24328	138.5	-0.079473	0	-0.189752!sample_table_end
