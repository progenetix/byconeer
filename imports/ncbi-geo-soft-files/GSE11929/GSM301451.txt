Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 17328#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	1900	431	5466.5	796	-1.156684	3	2	2064	448	5646	792	-1.099849	3	3	1748	443	5417.5	795	-1.264733	3	4	4443	380	8791.5	666	-0.693086	0	-0.7759735	4966	344	9968.5	564	-0.710361	0	-0.7759736	4496.5	301	10136	531.5	-0.828219	0	-0.7759737	2257	324	8058	616	-1.348066	0	-1.2696168	2241	308	7886	438	-1.348872	0	-1.2696169	1982	297	7150	399	-1.387925	0	-1.26961610	2723.5	294	6990	344	-1.00633	0	-0.77597311	2608	275	6180	251	-0.932701	0	-0.77597312	2594	266.5	6038	268.5	-0.907791	0	-0.77597313	742	260	1142.5	297	-0.561984	0	-1.26961614	651	265	1038	325	-0.613644	0	-1.26961615	641	268	1637	440.5	-1.165577	0	-1.26961616	3036	282	6493	545	-0.770001	0	-0.77597317	2262	289	5605	562	-0.938446	0	-0.77597318	2016.5	337	5897	442	-1.178036	0	-0.77597319	1702.5	339	4748	351.5	-1.170754	0	-1.26961620	1567	434	1078	721	1.154888	0	-1.269616!sample_table_end
