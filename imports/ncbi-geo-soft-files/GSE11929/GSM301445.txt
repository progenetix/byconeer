Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 17328#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	1922	331	6390	211	-1.356794	0	-1.424082	1117.5	258	3651.5	235	-1.380021	0	-1.424083	1549	243	5413	227	-1.378994	0	-1.2610464	3640	262	8901	266	-0.93854	0	-0.8697725	3894.5	249	9008	266	-0.874645	0	-0.8697726	3387	244	8322.5	243	-0.944152	0	-0.8697727	1698	239	4642	241	-1.104081	0	-1.2610468	1790	248	6745.5	248	-1.438337	0	-1.2610469	1689.5	248	4371	239.5	-1.052956	0	-1.26104610	2302	245	5101.5	243	-0.859481	0	-0.86977211	2068	239	5017	240	-0.960043	0	-0.86977212	2175	230	4740.5	237	-0.839593	0	-0.86977213	653	239	1562	228	-1.170071	0	-1.26104614	652	241	1488	215	-1.130538	0	-1.26104615	673	245	1562	214	-1.147254	0	-1.26104616	2672	244	5622.5	223	-0.799238	0	-0.86977217	2759	243	5608	220	-0.761504	0	-0.86977218	2505	247	5008	219	-0.751842	0	-0.86977219	1562	241	822	219	0.784227	0	-0.86021220	1411	333.5	4231	221	-1.314148	0	-0.860212!sample_table_end
