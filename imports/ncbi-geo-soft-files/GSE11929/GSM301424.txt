Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	7521.5	207.5	11638	219	-0.445488	0	-0.2907872	7027	212	10994.5	184.5	-0.461346	0	-0.2907873	7647	240	11629.5	204.5	-0.433378	0	-0.2907874	7162	249	9715	177	-0.32188	0	-0.1810325	6840	267	9503	227.5	-0.344406	0	-0.1810326	6782	232.5	9301	250	-0.323487	0	-0.1810327	7757.5	293	12535	244	-0.498709	0	-0.2793728	8027	245	11216	210	-0.346627	0	-0.2793729	7755	250	11822.5	181	-0.439007	0	-0.27937210	6608	255	9325.5	200	-0.362146	0	-0.18103211	6958	246	8847	215	-0.251579	0	-0.18103212	6972.5	265	9389.5	243	-0.310145	0	-0.18103213	12224	268.5	15384	258	-0.235224	0	-0.16211114	12734	283	15040	213	-0.174649	0	-0.16211115	13369	268	15962	196	-0.185167	0	-0.16211116	12573.5	237	15635	191	-0.224658	0	-0.16595817	11874	306	15104	213	-0.252514	0	-0.16595818	12926	336	16090.5	224	-0.231307	0	-0.16595819	16213	169	20118	129	-0.219847	0	-0.16211120	13451	268	17305	205	-0.26015	0	-0.162111!sample_table_end
