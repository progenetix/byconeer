Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	18280	769	28331	678	-0.456905	0	-0.2891952	18506	667	29261	631	-0.473068	0	-0.2891953	17689	641	27106	467	-0.446343	0	-0.2891954	14833	617	20799.5	360.5	-0.363077	0	-0.2088465	14012.5	527	20450	416	-0.395816	0	-0.2088466	14138	578.5	20826.5	454	-0.407099	0	-0.2088467	22319	688	27262	482	-0.213528	0	-0.0023118	21983	725.5	26432.5	490	-0.199173	0	-0.0023119	22556.5	715	26494	467	-0.175323	0	-0.00231110	14449	671	19681	472.5	-0.33228	0	-0.20884611	14757.5	669	19447	510	-0.295759	0	-0.20884612	15531	693.5	19717	507.5	-0.258247	0	-0.20884613	26093	700.5	32642	523	-0.234994	0	-0.20366414	25421	678.5	32522.5	494	-0.258104	0	-0.20366415	25500	612	32187.5	436	-0.243554	0	-0.20366416	34881	614	33022.5	392	0.048935	0	-0.00231117	34780	624	33798	390	0.022143	0	-0.00231118	34642	619	34592.5	392	-0.005203	0	-0.00231119	26975	779	39186	719	-0.384194	0	-0.20366420	27270	715	40251	665	-0.399257	0	-0.203664!sample_table_end
