Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 17328#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	1686.5	259	5936	215	-1.388219	0	-0.175322	3979	279.5	6203	231	-0.478884	0	-0.4358843	4035	290.5	6314	192	-0.491601	0	-0.4358844	5978	306	7540	194	-0.258614	0	-0.3217255	5615.5	279	7562.5	194	-0.322644	0	-0.3217256	6658	300	7911	208	-0.191896	0	-0.3217257	4844	429	7116.5	234	-0.443974	3	8	4650	469.5	6957.5	232	-0.475475	3	9	4426	474	6563	246	-0.469023	0	-0.43588410	3530	355	4199.5	226	-0.22434	0	-0.34956311	3345	321	4159	215	-0.265615	0	-0.34956312	3496	301	4121.5	217	-0.200543	0	-0.34956313	1776	280	2091.5	230.5	-0.218319	0	-0.43588414	1744	273	2057	209	-0.228162	0	-0.43588415	1706.5	268	1848	206	-0.132314	0	-0.43588416	4188	298	5045.5	204	-0.218815	0	-0.32172517	4224.5	274	4925.5	200.5	-0.179025	0	-0.32172518	3262	256	4407	200.5	-0.336021	0	-0.32172519	4443.5	257	5471.5	196	-0.231208	0	-0.43588420	4344	258	5751.5	197	-0.307042	0	-0.435884!sample_table_end
