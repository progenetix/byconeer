Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	4046	199	5290.5	162.5	-0.287422	0	-0.0507732	4083	202	5446	185	-0.304228	0	-0.0507733	3670.5	216	4912	229	-0.304261	0	-0.0507734	3095.5	215	3935	145	-0.274402	0	-0.0597045	3168.5	202	4214.5	142	-0.316874	0	-0.0597046	3094	200	4123	147	-0.317637	0	-0.0597047	3582.5	219	4591	146	-0.278798	0	-0.0646528	3803	235	4260	147	-0.142147	0	-0.0646529	3852	249	4363.5	148	-0.157001	0	-0.06465210	2760.5	252	3199	146	-0.19644	0	-0.05970411	2907	261	3421	147	-0.212963	0	-0.05970412	2859	302	3163	146	-0.165428	0	-0.05970413	4189	383	4566	149	-0.148882	0	-0.03779414	4371	425	4665	149	-0.134924	0	-0.03779415	4313	340	4592.5	147	-0.112371	0	-0.03779416	4457	395.5	4757.5	153	-0.125482	0	-0.06465217	4657	369	5243	169	-0.168309	0	-0.06465218	4296	434	5070	176	-0.236825	0	-0.06465219	4078	211	5590	166	-0.338355	0	-0.03779420	3845	206	4616.5	182	-0.197706	0	-0.037794!sample_table_end
