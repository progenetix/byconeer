Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	1574	261	3430	300.5	-0.868559	0	-0.7780482	1929.5	277.5	4617.5	327	-0.954417	0	-0.7780483	2119	288	4529	153	-0.871273	0	-0.7780484	1964	259	3949	136	-0.804851	0	-0.808935	2009	248	3831.5	131	-0.742586	0	-0.808936	2097.5	267	4237.5	146	-0.804322	0	-0.808937	2248	245	4293.5	156	-0.725446	0	-0.7555778	2205	257	4194	160	-0.727955	0	-0.7555779	2555	252	4881	159.5	-0.717914	0	-0.75557710	1489	243	3000	166	-0.821751	0	-0.8089311	1616.5	272.5	3133	165	-0.792238	0	-0.8089312	1494	261	2889	155	-0.796316	0	-0.8089313	2282	261	4823.5	140	-0.840453	0	-0.72726514	2358	255	4962	146	-0.828579	0	-0.72726515	2230	249	4821	150	-0.857771	0	-0.72726516	2720	246	5297	158	-0.731022	0	-0.75557717	2635.5	235	5128	149	-0.729552	0	-0.75557718	2600	230	5108	148	-0.738516	0	-0.75557719	2447	297	6167	443.5	-0.979113	0	-0.74154520	2268	281	5338	282	-0.93395	0	-0.741545!sample_table_end
