Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	12628.5	252	19267	320	-0.425846	0	-0.3381152	12016	284.5	20025.5	321	-0.51857	0	-0.3381153	12959	255	18748	326	-0.371629	0	-0.3381154	9109	262	14318.5	314	-0.4593	0	-0.3374985	9538	283.5	13430	378	-0.343831	0	-0.3374986	9020	290	13435	328	-0.406381	0	-0.3374987	10220	279	18011	334	-0.575597	0	-0.4511838	10893	307	19107.5	410	-0.568857	0	-0.4511839	10349	287	18663.5	410	-0.595591	0	-0.45118310	9826	268	13961	433	-0.347383	0	-0.33749811	10358.5	301	14696	454	-0.347877	0	-0.33749812	9814	319	14562	389	-0.400573	0	-0.33749813	17903	378	25079	419	-0.341554	0	-0.32942914	17498	396	24371.5	451	-0.33554	0	-0.32942915	17600	308	24174	397	-0.318475	0	-0.32942916	17567	248.5	25471	312	-0.37344	0	-0.33551817	17246	260	25035.5	299	-0.37589	0	-0.33551818	17692.5	255	25985.5	343	-0.385628	0	-0.33551819	20011	259	28523	330.5	-0.355801	0	-0.32942920	18831.5	292	27596	332.5	-0.385645	0	-0.329429!sample_table_end
