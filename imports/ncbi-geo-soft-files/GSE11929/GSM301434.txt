Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 17328#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	1774.5	372	2661	211	-0.557832	0	-0.891642	1774	360	3097	220	-0.710326	0	-0.891643	1682	340	3268	218	-0.820981	0	-0.891644	2642.5	293	5244	214	-0.761217	0	-0.7748865	2660	287	5754	210	-0.848561	0	-0.7748866	2555	299	4489.5	202	-0.64211	0	-0.7748867	2268	273	4992	195	-0.877347	0	-0.891648	2295	242	5445	190.5	-0.939783	0	-0.891649	2181.5	234	5270	194	-0.957977	0	-0.8916410	2186.5	229	4821.5	203	-0.858402	0	-0.77488611	2306	249	5246.5	213	-0.894867	0	-0.77488612	2043	273	4613	201	-0.913349	0	-0.77488613	851	252	1739	190	-0.950103	0	-0.8916414	900	240	1647	187.5	-0.793609	0	-0.8916415	1004	236	1923	184	-0.817276	0	-0.8916416	2637	241	6032	195	-0.890416	0	-0.77488617	2937.5	250	6183	197.5	-0.800728	0	-0.77488618	2648	254	5658	198	-0.824483	0	-0.77488619	2037	249	4220.5	192	-0.812296	0	-0.8916420	1385	387	1830	218	-0.479478	0	-0.89164!sample_table_end
