Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 17328#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	1906.5	350	4333	236	-0.967815	0	-1.2128272	1729	348	4253	237	-1.067479	0	-1.2128273	1862.5	394	4947.5	401	-1.130116	0	-1.2128274	3244	306	8133.5	391.5	-0.968931	0	-1.1508335	3159.5	274	10155	390.5	-1.219055	0	-1.1508336	3069	250	10124	376	-1.24068	0	-1.1508337	1922	218	6019	327	-1.206083	0	-1.2128278	1914	213	5743	268	-1.168976	0	-1.2128279	1789	222	5971	249	-1.295155	0	-1.21282710	1694	227.5	6096	231	-1.386124	0	-1.15083311	1579.5	254	6038	616	-1.408675	0	-1.15083312	1618	290	5538	950	-1.23977	0	-1.15083313	444.5	242	1841	350	-1.996462	0	-1.21282714	776.5	256	2210.5	642	-1.103085	0	-1.21282715	679	266	2168	783.5	-1.209647	0	-1.21282716	1989	271	5736.5	545	-1.105862	0	-1.15083317	2070	250	7272	419	-1.32585	0	-1.15083318	1699	238	4339	355	-1.003165	0	-1.15083319	1499	210	5418	298	-1.379288	0	-1.21282720	1695	348	3809	251	-0.971319	0	-1.212827!sample_table_end
