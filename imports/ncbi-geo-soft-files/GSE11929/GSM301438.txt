Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	2933	297	4153.5	127	-0.423635	0	-0.2767032	2844	260	4357.5	123	-0.493927	0	-0.2767033	2910	189	4764	123	-0.53393	0	-0.2767034	2399	170	4125	120	-0.585991	0	-0.2520335	2466	172	4261.5	121	-0.59052	0	-0.2520336	2416.5	156	4182	121	-0.585843	0	-0.2520337	3277	162	4772	121	-0.400853	0	-0.1425468	3300	153	4830	121	-0.403026	0	-0.1425469	3406.5	154	4863.5	125	-0.376297	0	-0.14254610	2464	157	3465	122	-0.370921	0	-0.11621711	2514	159	3465	121	-0.350627	0	-0.11621712	2477	165	3479	122	-0.372935	0	-0.11621713	3970	155	5657.5	120	-0.372602	0	-0.13357914	3527	162	4869	122	-0.344085	0	-0.13357915	3851.5	222	4935	124	-0.28181	0	-0.13357916	4029	225	5327	125	-0.31299	0	-0.13997117	3808	214	4872	128	-0.277615	0	-0.13997118	3724.5	218	4702	129	-0.265551	0	-0.13997119	3418.5	326	4430.5	129	-0.329984	0	-0.13357920	3231.5	292.5	4358	127	-0.364369	0	-0.133579!sample_table_end
