Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	18070	427	21725.5	117	-0.202748	0	-0.0170222	18857.5	478	20625	92	-0.110797	0	-0.0170223	18149	496.5	21785	132	-0.204267	0	-0.0170224	12314	458.5	14747	132	-0.209257	0	0.0076395	13574.5	444	15972	107	-0.189178	0	0.0076396	13825	445	16910	137.5	-0.22598	0	0.0076397	24174	576	21270	152.5	0.11106	0	0.2370148	22850	531	20437	121	0.09403	0	0.2370149	24968	480	21867	139	0.119581	0	0.23701410	13218	456	14733	101	-0.136739	0	0.00763911	14576	448	16477.5	154	-0.144447	0	0.00763912	14721.5	505	16404.5	125	-0.135503	0	0.00763913	28683.5	526	27750.5	136	0.019473	0	0.08774714	29152	501	28707	158.5	0.003584	0	0.08774715	29897	496	28021	123	0.052474	0	0.08774716	34937	552	29944	126	0.142508	0	0.15768317	37335.5	478	31576	125.5	0.158644	0	0.15768318	35298	476	30951	148	0.122637	0	0.15768319	33181.5	505.5	28033	133.5	0.158032	0	0.08774720	28451.5	383	25804	142	0.089637	0	0.087747!sample_table_end
