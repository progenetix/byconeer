Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 17328#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	3007.5	214	3269	174	-0.102493	0	-1.1133112	3040.5	227	6985.5	183	-0.882861	0	-1.1133113	2990.5	239	6824	193	-0.879609	0	-1.1133114	3829	242	9701	205	-0.973554	0	-0.9469485	3827	224	9055.5	197	-0.899611	0	-0.9469486	3898.5	227	9407	193.5	-0.92007	0	-0.9469487	3502	248	8444	217	-0.927536	0	-1.0024768	3259	245	8255	216	-0.981037	0	-1.0024769	3254	251	7823	222	-0.928668	0	-1.00247610	2260	228	5228	213	-0.903413	0	-0.90880411	2218	247	5108	226	-0.907014	0	-0.90880412	2310.5	284	3816.5	243	-0.567235	0	-0.90880413	1228	285	2401.5	252	-0.823924	0	-0.93326914	1131	288	1487	257	-0.377802	0	-0.93326915	1258.5	310	2264	264	-0.746021	0	-0.93326916	2829	319	6508	271	-0.910217	0	-0.90880417	3256	331	6921.5	264	-0.82245	0	-0.90880418	3458	503	7214	277	-0.853371	0	-0.90880419	2463.5	431	6851	281	-1.173247	0	-0.93326920	2573	219	5923	176.5	-0.892475	0	-0.933269!sample_table_end
