Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	11178	234.5	29515	356	-0.980018	0	-0.8719852	10963	232	28440.5	342.5	-0.962562	0	-0.8719853	10718	155	28133.5	332.5	-0.967715	0	-0.8719854	10042	208	24548	333	-0.901127	0	-0.7726035	10482	184	25677	338.5	-0.900375	0	-0.7726036	10554	198	25562	323	-0.890824	0	-0.7726037	16934.5	177.5	32218.5	301	-0.644338	0	-0.5596418	15997	151	31654	291.5	-0.682696	0	-0.5596419	16345.5	217	31762.5	262	-0.669416	0	-0.55964110	10104.5	158	24520	328	-0.888801	0	-0.77260311	10201	146	24012.5	344	-0.856075	0	-0.77260312	10246	187	24666.5	342.5	-0.882996	0	-0.77260313	18805	200	44007	321	-0.853597	0	-0.74071914	19153	183	43250	357	-0.81585	0	-0.74071915	18260	213	42834	394	-0.855112	0	-0.74071916	23566	192	47581	326	-0.703934	0	-0.55964117	24720.5	190.5	47992	387	-0.663041	0	-0.55964118	24999	240	45064.5	344	-0.591243	0	-0.55964119	21670	251	49736	357	-0.835247	0	-0.74071920	19529	244	42472	345.5	-0.781349	0	-0.740719!sample_table_end
