Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	10009.5	318	21883	317.5	-0.799846	0	-0.5749272	11070.5	352.5	24523	332.5	-0.814035	0	-0.5749273	11147.5	341	21651.5	291.5	-0.681372	0	-0.5749274	8626	298	19460.5	313	-0.832549	0	-0.5336565	9046	329	19595	341.5	-0.792418	0	-0.5336566	8418.5	203	19557	297	-0.852008	0	-0.5336567	16326	264	25618.5	336	-0.453656	0	-0.1810328	17080.5	236.5	25615	330	-0.406217	0	-0.1810329	17287	336	26916.5	349	-0.449362	0	-0.18103210	9391	230	18706	307	-0.697341	0	-0.53365611	9240	244	18531	287	-0.707056	0	-0.53365612	9601	238.5	19409	324	-0.71219	0	-0.53365613	20884	300	32002	366	-0.429782	0	-0.38857314	20294	287	32296	323	-0.46881	0	-0.38857315	20990	285	33074	320	-0.45865	0	-0.38857316	28464.5	277	35174	336	-0.21183	0	-0.18103217	27534	294	36456	363	-0.281412	0	-0.18103218	28542	254	36371	338	-0.241997	0	-0.18103219	23506.5	326.5	37000.5	338	-0.458465	0	-0.38857320	21753	328	34178	339	-0.457056	0	-0.388573!sample_table_end
