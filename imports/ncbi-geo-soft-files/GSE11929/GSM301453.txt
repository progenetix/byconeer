Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	3549	221.5	6073	208	-0.566781	0	-0.6287922	3735.5	248	6625	212	-0.609142	0	-0.6287923	3781	226	6910	193.5	-0.636212	0	-0.6287924	5052	194	8607	182.5	-0.550517	0	-0.5366925	4777	195	8316	200	-0.571702	0	-0.5366926	4877	193	8514	202.5	-0.573488	0	-0.5366927	4361	204	7967	232	-0.620962	0	-0.6287928	4012	222	7164	240	-0.602628	0	-0.6287929	4057	212	7185	234	-0.592112	0	-0.62879210	3723	205	4965.5	178	-0.308116	0	-0.47091411	3557	246	4773	184	-0.326412	0	-0.47091412	3562	297.5	4747	199	-0.331581	0	-0.47091413	1649	287	2479.5	206	-0.512366	0	-0.62879214	1587	322	2431	225	-0.556109	0	-0.62879215	1568	341	2287	219	-0.52201	0	-0.62879216	4649	304.5	6025	205	-0.29239	0	-0.47091417	4976	215	6681	204	-0.3078	0	-0.47091418	4890	174	7276	207	-0.404758	0	-0.47091419	3844	176	6901	210	-0.601117	0	-0.62879220	3410	234	3505.5	207	-0.037845	0	-0.628792!sample_table_end
