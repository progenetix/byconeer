Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 17328#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	3827	369	6697.5	271	-0.61974	3	2	4289	312	8034	223	-0.675005	0	-0.7373473	4299	303	8417	211.5	-0.719511	0	-0.7373474	5656.5	281	10579	201	-0.657837	0	-0.6726065	5510.5	273	10677	208	-0.692574	0	-0.6726066	5750	261	10697	208	-0.647581	0	-0.6726067	5610	248.5	11249	202	-0.722915	0	-0.7373478	5344	208	11789	194	-0.814299	0	-0.7373479	5255	221	11287.5	191	-0.790415	0	-0.73734710	5170.5	223	7270	201.5	-0.356766	0	-0.38000311	5063	230	7818	222	-0.452154	0	-0.38000312	5200	232	7792	205	-0.423419	0	-0.38000313	2207	225	3681	202	-0.562638	0	-0.73734714	2190.5	245.5	3513.5	195.5	-0.5341	0	-0.73734715	2270	310	3333	203	-0.468089	0	-0.73734716	7830	396	10777	217	-0.351009	3	17	3526	373	4811	247	-0.369845	3	18	3759	316	8048.5	275	-0.814377	3	19	2971	290.5	7200.5	359	-0.937004	3	20	4179	312	7463	233	-0.62576	0	-0.763894!sample_table_end
