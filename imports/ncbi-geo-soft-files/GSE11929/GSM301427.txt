Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 17328#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	3895	257	5776	169	-0.432582	0	-0.453982	4077	247.5	6275.5	171	-0.466292	0	-0.453983	4159.5	232	6219	169	-0.432055	0	-0.453984	6314.5	229	8113.5	172	-0.266193	0	-0.1907075	5639	222	7739	170	-0.334519	0	-0.1907076	5992	227	7857	173	-0.287335	0	-0.1907077	5281	229	7910.5	174	-0.426165	0	-0.453988	4789.5	221	7250	170	-0.438089	0	-0.453989	4351	220	6561	176	-0.435432	0	-0.4539810	3287	220	3438	166	-0.064702	0	-0.19070711	3551.5	225	4467	170	-0.255996	0	-0.19070712	3123	223	4160	167	-0.319832	0	-0.19070713	769.5	229	1567	171	-0.948872	0	-0.37275114	1110	236	1563	179	-0.459653	0	-0.37275115	1133.5	260	1083.5	189	-0.023757	0	-0.37275116	5707	267	5747	196	-0.020199	0	-0.19070717	4260	250	4492.5	185	-0.071566	0	-0.19070718	4996	241	5740	181	-0.156222	0	-0.19070719	4720.5	240	6415.5	188	-0.32924	0	-0.37275120	3087	259	4832	171	-0.49966	0	-0.372751!sample_table_end
