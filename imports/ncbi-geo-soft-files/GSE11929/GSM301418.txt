Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	24940	624.5	27122	346	-0.096392	0	-0.0988852	26971	563.5	27546	283	-0.031882	0	-0.0988853	25541.5	527.5	28589	294	-0.123249	0	-0.0988854	17715	550	21727.5	327.5	-0.220518	0	-0.0897875	16880	622.5	21219.5	350	-0.249734	0	-0.0897876	16852	640.5	21164	349	-0.249953	0	-0.0897877	22587	661	28441	393	-0.246244	0	-0.1284358	22626	732	27470	417	-0.211585	0	-0.1284359	22205.5	715	27441	476	-0.226929	0	-0.12843510	18365	830	21085	586	-0.156177	0	-0.08978711	18558.5	824	21593	560	-0.170581	0	-0.08978712	18803	679	22103.5	397	-0.180375	0	-0.08978713	31329	617	38416	351	-0.214642	0	-0.09014614	31623	582.5	37904	357	-0.190301	0	-0.09014615	31452.5	576	36956.5	338	-0.170558	0	-0.09014616	30926	578	38400	376	-0.225487	0	-0.12843517	30999	600	38381	331	-0.224491	0	-0.12843518	30753	621	38707	356	-0.241193	0	-0.12843519	35842	701	38122	408	-0.070663	0	-0.09014620	35689	702	39384	376	-0.10879	0	-0.090146!sample_table_end
