Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 17328#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	2983	186	6261	175.5	-0.777361	0	-0.6567432	3308	186	6726	179	-0.740533	0	-0.6567433	3070.5	188	6277.5	175	-0.750041	0	-0.6567434	5355	186.5	9678.5	176	-0.608972	0	-0.5825115	5597.5	183	10811	179	-0.674788	0	-0.5825116	5508	183	10412	185	-0.652619	0	-0.5825117	4129	183	9144	183	-0.820179	0	-0.6567438	3876	179	8050	175	-0.756172	0	-0.6567439	3749.5	179	7923	173	-0.774987	0	-0.65674310	3309	176.5	6585	173	-0.71634	0	-0.61368511	3073	169	6365	172	-0.757331	0	-0.61368512	2803	168	5847	171	-0.767364	0	-0.61368513	821	166	1818	168	-0.923895	0	-0.65674314	1214	167	1937	167	-0.525051	0	-0.65674315	1101	178	1742	175	-0.529289	0	-0.65674316	3855	188.5	6339	188	-0.517377	0	-0.58251117	3816	174	7308	181	-0.671357	0	-0.58251118	3726	162	7275	163	-0.6909	0	-0.58251119	3124	155	6056	162	-0.68571	0	-0.65674320	2986	183	494.5	174	2.168563	0	-0.656743!sample_table_end
