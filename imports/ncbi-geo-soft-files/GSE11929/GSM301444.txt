Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 17328#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	2212	394	5727	956	-0.964819	0	-1.0851252	2433	433	6033	948.5	-0.93305	0	-1.0851253	2310	480	3987	951	-0.506225	0	-1.0851254	4496	500	8255.5	967	-0.601004	0	-0.8069315	4296	510	8013	887.5	-0.63237	0	-0.8069316	4120	440	7863.5	688	-0.66776	0	-0.8069317	2779	419	6451	589	-0.909829	0	-1.0851258	2479	425	5898	558	-0.955437	0	-1.0851259	2358	423	5587	560	-0.954716	0	-1.08512510	2787	425	5032	536	-0.643679	0	-0.80693111	2799	454	4890	513	-0.624078	0	-0.80693112	2637	496	4307	532	-0.567127	0	-0.80693113	1104	470	2246	530	-0.995702	0	-1.08512514	1179	530	1859	478.5	-0.754768	0	-1.08512515	1070.5	510	1776	477	-0.840521	0	-1.08512516	3074	451	5294	434	-0.61672	0	-0.80693117	3204.5	446	4957	390.5	-0.50406	0	-0.80693118	3061	424.5	5141	425	-0.581509	0	-0.80693119	2523.5	359	6233	487.5	-0.976228	0	-1.08512520	2169	422.5	5580.5	935.5	-0.978178	0	-1.085125!sample_table_end
