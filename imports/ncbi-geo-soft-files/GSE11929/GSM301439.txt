Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	20674.5	394.5	24890.5	310.5	-0.192298	0	-0.2077732	19145	449	24684	297	-0.265741	0	-0.2077733	20379	465	26363	308	-0.268787	0	-0.2077734	11993	497	19811	319.5	-0.527979	0	-0.3162395	11719	530	18506.5	322	-0.485638	0	-0.3162396	11956	524	19924	355	-0.53753	0	-0.3162397	19648	527	26690.5	362	-0.319865	0	-0.1659568	20074	526	27991	437	-0.343275	0	-0.1659569	20149	592	28084.5	394	-0.347756	0	-0.16595610	14838	488	19318	404	-0.276152	0	-0.20635111	15175	606	19215.5	403	-0.255626	0	-0.20635112	15531.5	676	19128	459	-0.228494	0	-0.20635113	26303	733	31894	492	-0.205452	0	-0.19591614	27286	680	34177	518	-0.235144	0	-0.19591615	27499	734.5	34161	506.5	-0.22907	0	-0.19591616	37774	798	35683	601.5	0.052595	0	0.10465717	38754	642	35053	393.5	0.094957	0	0.10465718	40003	688	36316	427	0.091175	0	0.10465719	27721	511	32296	301	-0.161995	0	-0.19591620	26733	462	31984	310	-0.18703	0	-0.195916!sample_table_end
