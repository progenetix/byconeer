Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 17328#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	570	517	293	226	-0.234401	1	2	710	548	282	239	1.326396	1	3	787	661.5	341	266	0.514818	1	4	1145	796	435	325.5	1.159147	3	5	1222.5	831	554	418	1.057331	3	6	922	801	580	487	0.263191	1	7	824	728	547	468	0.1949	1	8	754.5	638	467	326	-0.190869	1	9	646	503	359	262	0.388134	1	10	812	466	308	247	1.735565	1	11	792	459.5	384.5	254	0.935267	1	12	767	450	392	260.5	0.879895	1	13	484	456	289	266	0.19671	2	14	449	430	289.5	270	-0.025975	1	15	452	380	286	273	1.711717	1	16	730	402	339	266	1.502554	1	17	878.5	431	411	264	1.113244	1	18	652	469	390	283	0.536657	1	19	524	442	334	275	0.329182	1	20	679	598	286.5	243	0.621688	2	!sample_table_end
