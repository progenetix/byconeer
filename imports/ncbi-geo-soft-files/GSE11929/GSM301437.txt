Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	5035	290	5203.5	197	-0.053646	0	0.1742052	5158.5	224	5377.5	147.5	-0.05816	0	0.1742053	5286.5	187	5424	127	-0.037998	0	0.1742054	3804.5	171	4423	121	-0.168884	0	0.1006925	3779	175	4410	118	-0.174708	0	0.1006926	3698.5	204	4118.5	122	-0.134229	0	0.1006927	4474	225	4759.5	122	-0.087492	0	0.0958318	4298	216	4713	120	-0.117946	0	0.0958319	4450	219	4942	120	-0.13075	0	0.09583110	3820.5	213	3472	119	0.07316	0	0.1756811	4004	207	3605	118	0.08517	0	0.1756812	3614	200	3251	117	0.085574	0	0.1756813	8286	186	5344	117	0.438027	0	0.25259414	7768	183.5	5019	118	0.436667	0	0.25259415	7947.5	187	5178	120	0.428076	0	0.25259416	6418	189	5247.5	125	0.195573	0	0.26168917	6509	189	5176.5	124.5	0.223935	0	0.26168918	6213	180	5067	120	0.198463	0	0.26168919	5528.5	247	5791	157	-0.06461	0	0.25259420	5032	213	5461.5	137	-0.099752	0	0.252594!sample_table_end
