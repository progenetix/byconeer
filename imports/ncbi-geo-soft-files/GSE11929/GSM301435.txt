Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	2167.5	179	3209	137	-0.434948	0	-0.3021272	3500	161	5390	124	-0.4556	0	-0.3021273	3534	154	5435.5	121	-0.452563	0	-0.3021274	3227	163	5287	124	-0.521797	0	-0.2966995	3046.5	147	4955	124	-0.510515	0	-0.2966996	2967	146	4657	123	-0.474513	0	-0.2966997	3606.5	158	5555	124	-0.454184	0	-0.2882418	3553	166	5535	126	-0.46812	0	-0.2882419	3561	159	5503	128	-0.457395	0	-0.28824110	2642	159	4104.5	128	-0.470935	0	-0.29669911	2658	156	4067	130	-0.453329	0	-0.29669912	2642	155	4032	132	-0.449899	0	-0.29669913	4299	162	5802	131	-0.315395	0	-0.16564414	4076.5	173	5164.5	134	-0.253646	0	-0.16564415	3804	197	4640	140	-0.221201	0	-0.16564416	4093	214	5552	141	-0.332857	0	-0.28824117	3906	222	5212	142	-0.319342	0	-0.28824118	3754	213	5202	143	-0.35676	0	-0.28824119	2637	183	3898	147	-0.424303	0	-0.17703420	4320	170	5742	124	-0.302867	0	-0.177034!sample_table_end
