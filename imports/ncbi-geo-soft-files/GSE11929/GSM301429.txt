Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 17328#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	4164	229	9189	176	-0.828757	0	-0.8274862	4225	236	9491.5	179	-0.847817	0	-0.8274863	3799.5	251	9115	179	-0.923563	0	-0.8274864	6307	255	11236	181	-0.602494	0	-0.5949265	6873.5	260	11932	182	-0.57474	0	-0.5949266	7013	256	12445	175.5	-0.596538	0	-0.5949267	5760	250	10737	177	-0.650509	0	-0.8274868	4637	251	9466.5	184	-0.749713	0	-0.8274869	4794	253	9843	183	-0.754846	0	-0.82748610	5452	255	8119.5	181	-0.423643	0	-0.47623511	5762	252	7874	177	-0.334266	0	-0.47623512	4974	262	6846	181	-0.346758	0	-0.47623513	1345	253	2040	173	-0.536322	0	-0.82748614	1162	260	2022	172.5	-0.718056	0	-0.82748615	1142.5	262	1929	177	-0.688023	0	-0.82748616	5135	255	6908	175	-0.321876	0	-0.59492617	5315	252	7062	173	-0.307967	0	-0.59492618	4898	239	6319	170	-0.277489	0	-0.59492619	2554	275	4732	169	-0.694244	0	-0.82748620	3634	239.5	7582	182	-0.779324	0	-0.827486!sample_table_end
