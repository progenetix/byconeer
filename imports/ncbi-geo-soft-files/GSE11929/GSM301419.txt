Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 17328#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	2036	392	3606	302.5	-0.69785	0	-0.8408792	1908	375	2467	379	-0.30898	0	-0.8408793	2017	366	3864	371	-0.74938	0	-0.8408794	3566.5	331	6319.5	296	-0.621485	0	-0.7921445	3136	303	5847	290	-0.673722	0	-0.7921446	3104.5	293	6006.5	302	-0.707537	0	-0.7921447	2340	303	3214	506	-0.284732	3	8	2118	291	2859	533	-0.241475	3	9	2164	257	4737.5	448	-0.810639	0	-0.84087910	1890	221	4936	302	-1.021196	0	-0.79214411	1940	208	4824	320	-0.955689	0	-0.79214412	1847	207	4734	340	-0.985544	0	-0.79214413	591.5	196	1867	250	-1.408177	0	-0.84087914	737	192	1662	255	-0.948429	0	-0.84087915	801	192.5	1304	300	-0.50075	0	-0.84087916	2116	189	4878	310	-0.863111	0	-0.79214417	2061	193	4693.5	334.5	-0.847374	0	-0.79214418	2223	197	5408.5	288	-0.927189	0	-0.79214419	1730	204	3760	320	-0.812822	0	-0.84087920	2209	409	4271	287.5	-0.794374	0	-0.840879!sample_table_end
