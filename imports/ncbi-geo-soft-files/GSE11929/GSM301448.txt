Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	6630	185	15936	227	-0.890929	0	-0.8622282	6619	160	15818.5	223	-0.881508	0	-0.8622283	6856.5	184.5	17353.5	229	-0.942591	0	-0.8622284	6723	155	14304	202.5	-0.764072	0	-0.7026635	7330.5	118.5	14324.5	184	-0.673297	0	-0.7026636	6601	173	14155	214	-0.774171	0	-0.7026637	7833	182	19228	271	-0.907337	0	-0.8244678	7130	193	18972.5	298	-0.99029	0	-0.8244679	7403.5	231.5	19080	290	-0.96314	0	-0.82446710	6311	175	14134.5	241	-0.817248	0	-0.70266311	6165	155	14019.5	295	-0.825758	0	-0.70266312	6172	178	13534	316	-0.790821	0	-0.70266313	12239	211	24546	362	-0.698454	0	-0.60224814	12484	190	24588	274	-0.681941	0	-0.60224815	12347.5	168	24479.5	171	-0.691072	0	-0.60224816	16712.5	151	26471.5	218	-0.460719	0	-0.39887217	16493	155	26476	222	-0.474325	0	-0.39887218	17244	174.5	26945	242	-0.447483	0	-0.39887219	13669	197	26617	235	-0.672069	0	-0.60224820	14029	172	26138	228.5	-0.625819	0	-0.602248!sample_table_end
