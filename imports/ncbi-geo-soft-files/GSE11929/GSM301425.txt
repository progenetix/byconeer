Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 17328#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	2497	246	5976.5	182	-0.945535	0	-0.8875392	2403	242	4376.5	184	-0.662726	0	-0.8875393	2321	248	5668.5	192	-0.971469	0	-0.8875394	3851	249	6970	212	-0.629238	0	-0.6780225	3839	248	7106.5	219	-0.651277	0	-0.6780226	3849	239	7149.5	195	-0.655681	0	-0.6780227	2907.5	232	6856	185	-0.913633	0	-0.8875398	2008.5	221.5	4875	179.5	-0.966066	0	-0.8875399	2620	223	6281.5	175	-0.935136	0	-0.88753910	2604	228	4482	182	-0.593197	0	-0.66297311	2444	223	4442.5	190	-0.64955	0	-0.66297312	2423	227	4293	189	-0.625325	0	-0.66297313	827	226	1620.5	188	-0.868582	0	-0.88753914	749	228	1499	199	-0.91437	0	-0.88753915	756	227	1432	200.5	-0.845	0	-0.88753916	2948	229	5283	197	-0.626228	0	-0.66297317	3190.5	224	5754	196	-0.627856	0	-0.66297318	3468	229	5783	201	-0.544282	0	-0.66297319	2113	234	4656	195	-0.864633	0	-0.88753920	2050	260	4846	189	-0.956156	0	-0.887539!sample_table_end
