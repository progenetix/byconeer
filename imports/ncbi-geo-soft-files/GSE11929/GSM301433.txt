Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11929!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	3265	170	4813	124	-0.415431	0	-0.4706172	3483	188	5256	125	-0.442894	0	-0.4706173	3453	164	5217	122	-0.437676	0	-0.4706174	2853	176	4676	126	-0.53043	0	-0.4879835	2785	159	4510	122	-0.513412	0	-0.4879836	2615	147	4352	121	-0.53903	0	-0.4879837	3086	137	4904	117	-0.484438	0	-0.4561148	3008	141	4658	121	-0.459	0	-0.4561149	3355.5	146	5474	124	-0.510981	0	-0.45611410	2520	166	3595	131	-0.386308	0	-0.47345711	2369	158	3537	127	-0.433267	0	-0.47345712	2258	149	3541.5	126	-0.48211	0	-0.47345713	3517	148	5430	125	-0.454034	0	-0.46707814	3577	149	5787.5	126	-0.501712	0	-0.46707815	3494	145	5812.5	124	-0.529785	0	-0.46707816	3733	148	5967.5	127	-0.488058	0	-0.47109817	3917	160	6534	131	-0.533146	0	-0.47109818	4101	157	6728	130	-0.514571	0	-0.47109819	3261	196	5017	128.5	-0.466838	0	-0.46707820	3177	211	4865.5	127	-0.468506	0	-0.467078!sample_table_end
