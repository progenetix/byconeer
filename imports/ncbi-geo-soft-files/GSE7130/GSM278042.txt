Briefly, 250 ng of tumor DNA was digested by either HindIII or XbaI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs, Boston, MA, USA). After ligation to an appropriate adaptor for each enzyme, PCR reaction was carried out using a generic primer that recognizes the adapter sequence. The PCR products from four reactions were pooled, concentrated, fragmented by DNase I and then, labeled with biotin.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Hybridization was performed at 45Â°C for 16h in a hybridization machine (Affymetrix).!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were washed and stained on the Affymetrix fluidics Station 450 and the signal intensities were measured using the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Several serial frozen tissue sections (20 Âµm thickness) were prepared for tissue microdissection. An additional 4-Âµm section was also made for detailed histological examination by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Only PDAC regions were microdissected under visualization with an inverted microscope (Nikon 66906, Tokyo, Japan) using a sterile 26-gauge needle.!Sample_data_processing = The raw images were analyzed using the Affymetrix GCOS (Ver1.4) software. For genotyping analysis, we used the Affymetrix GTYPE (Ver4.1) software that implements an accurate genotyping algorithm, BRLMM (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/product_updates/brlmm_algorithm.affx).!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Tomohiko,,Harada!Sample_contact_email = tomo-harada@umin.ac.jp!Sample_contact_laboratory = Barts and The London!Sample_contact_department = Centre for Molecular Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Cancer Research UK!Sample_contact_address = Charterhouse Square!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = EC1M 6BQ!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM278nnn/GSM278042/suppl/GSM278042.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM278nnn/GSM278042/suppl/GSM278042.CHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM278nnn/GSM278042/suppl/GSM278042.EXP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE7130!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype call by BRLMM algorithm#CONFIDENCE = The confidence in the call#RAS1 = The 1st relative allele strength#RAS2 = The 2nd relative allele strength#P-VALUE AA = The p-value associated with an AA call#P-VALUE AB = The p-value associated with an AB call#P-VALUE BB = The p-value associated with a BB call#P-VALUE NO CALL = The p-value associated with a No Call call!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	RAS1	RAS2	P-VALUE AA	P-VALUE AB	P-VALUE BB	P-VALUE NO CALLAFFX-5Q-123	No Call	9781.5	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-456	No Call	2042.5	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-789	No Call	15897	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-ABC	No Call	18924.5	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeA	No Call	502	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeB	No Call	617.5	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeC	No Call	287.5	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeD	No Call	378.5	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeE	No Call	541.5	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeF	No Call	452	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeG	No Call	626.5	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeH	No Call	434.5	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeI	No Call	469	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeJ	No Call	943.5	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeK	No Call	398	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeL	No Call	339	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeM	No Call	397.5	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeN	No Call	594	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeO	No Call	306.5	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeP	No Call	481.5	0	0	0	0	0	0!sample_table_end
