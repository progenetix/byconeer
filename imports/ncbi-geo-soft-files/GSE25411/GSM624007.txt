Aberrant DNA copy number intervals identified using the Aberration Detection Method 2 (ADM-2), default threshold setting 6.0, and Fuzzy Zero correction algorithm applied. To ensure the exclusion of very low or very small aberrations, we added a custom-made aberration filter defining a region with a copy number aberration as a region with minimum five probes gained/lost and with minimum absolute average log2 ratio of 0.2 (gain) or -0.2 (loss). A loss defined as homozygous when the log2 ratio was lower than -1, and a gain was regarded as high level amplification when the log2 ratio was higher than 1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL10123!Sample_contact_name = Hanne-Sofie,S,Dahlback!Sample_contact_email = h.s.s.dahlback@medisin.uio.no!Sample_contact_department = Section for Cancer Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_institute = The Norwegian Radium Hospital!Sample_contact_address = Montebello!Sample_contact_city = Oslo!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 0310!Sample_contact_country = Norway!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM624nnn/GSM624007/suppl/GSM624007_US83800213_252206011658_S01_CGH_105_Dec08_1_4_17_09-0589.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25411!Sample_data_row_count = 180880#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	1.066258826e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	2.158824298e-0015	0.000000000e+0006	0.000000000e+0007	0.000000000e+0008	0.000000000e+0009	0.000000000e+00010	1.595002608e-00111	0.000000000e+00012	0.000000000e+00013	0.000000000e+00014	0.000000000e+00015	0.000000000e+00016	0.000000000e+00017	0.000000000e+00018	0.000000000e+00019	2.697125409e-00120	0.000000000e+000!sample_table_end
