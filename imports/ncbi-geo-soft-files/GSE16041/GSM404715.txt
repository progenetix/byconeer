The dried pellets from the labeling steps were re-suspended in 50 Âµl of hybridization solution (50% Formamide, 4% SDS, 10 %, Dextran Sulfate, M.W. 500 000, 2 X SSC) and denatured for 5 min at 95Â°C, followed by incubation at 45Â°C for 2 h to block repetitive sequences. Subsequently, the probe mixture was applied to the slide surface, covered with a lifterslip (22x60mm, Erie Scientific, Portsmouth, NH) and hybridized at 45 Â°C for 20 hours in a slide chamber (Corning Inc. Life Sciences, Big Flats, NY). After hybridization the lifterslip was rinsed off using 1xPBS. Washing was performed in 25 % formamide, 2 X SSC, 0.1% SDS, at 45ÂºC, for 15 min, followed by 10 min in 1 X PBS at room temperature, and brief rinse in 0.2 X SSC. The array was immersed in deionized H2O and immediately dried using pressurized dust-free air.!Sample_scan_protocol = Image acquisition was performed using the GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments Inc, Union City, CA), and image analysis was carried out using the GenePixPro v6 software (Axon Instruments).!Sample_description = n/a!Sample_data_processing = We uploaded the GPR files from GenePix pro into a perl script called colloactor. This script links the information about clones to the array position. It also uploads the raw data to the BASE platform. These raw data files are attached as tables. Filtering and normalization was done using the LCB Data-WareHouse (dw.lcb.uu.se). The filters applied on the raw data removed spots containing more than 5% oversaturated pixels, spots with low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR<3) and spots automatically and manually flagged as bad, absent or not found in GenePixPro program. Normalization was done using a print-tip loess method.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6088!Sample_contact_name = Kiran,Kumar,Mantripragada!Sample_contact_department = Medical Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = Cardiff University!Sample_contact_address = Heath Park Campus!Sample_contact_city = Cardiff!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CF14 4XN!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM404nnn/GSM404715/suppl/GSM404715.GPR.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16041!Sample_data_row_count = 32316#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio test/reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	0.002	0.033	0.294	-0.255	0.206	-0.057	-0.048	-0.069	0.0110	0.2011	-0.0112	-0.1113	0.0914	-0.0415	-0.0316	0.0317	-0.1018	-0.0119	0.4120	-0.06!sample_table_end
