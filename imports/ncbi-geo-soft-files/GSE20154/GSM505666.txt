DNA extracted was then cleaned using phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and precipitated using ethanol and sodium acetate.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA labeling was performed using the BioPrime DNA labeling kit reagents (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and according to protocols described previously (van den Ijssel, P et. al, 2005). 300ng of genomic DNA was mixed with 20Âµl of 2.5x random primer and miliQ water to a total volume of 42 Âµl. After the mixture was denatured, Cy3-dCTP (test sample) or Cy5-dCTP (pooled reference sample) and exo-klenow DNA polymerase were added to the mixture and incubated for 16 hours at 37Â°C. After removing unincorporated Cy3 and Cy5 using ProbeQuant G-50 Micro Spin Columns (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK), labeled DNA was collected in microfuge tubes. 5 dye-swap experiments were undertaken whereby the test sample was labeled with Cy5 and the reference sample with Cy3 to compare the consistency of data derived.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = pooled reference sample!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = reference: pooled reference sample!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = On average, 10 30Âµm cryostat sections were prepared for the extraction of genomic DNA from tumor samples embedded in optimal cutting temperature mounting medium.

The pellet was re-dissolved in 13 ml of yeast tRNA (100 mg/ml, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 26 ml of 20% SDS. 105Âµl of hybridization solution (4.3% (w/v) dextran sulphate (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK), 50% (v/v) ultra pure de-ionised formamide (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 2.9x saline-sodium citrate (SSC) pH 7.0 (Sigma Aldrich, Paisley, UK)) was added and gently mixed. The hybridization mixture was then denatured (73Â°C, 10 minutes) and incubated (37Â°C, 60 minutes). Slide hybridization and washing were undertaken using a GeneTAC/HybArray12 hybridization station (Genomic Solutions, Huntingdon, UK), performed for 38 hours at 37Â°C using a continuous agitation mode. After hybridization, slides were washed for 6 cycles (flow for 10 seconds, hold for 20 seconds) with 50% (v/v) formamide/2x SSC (VWR International, Lutterworth, UK), 2 cycles with phosphate-buffer (0.1 M Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, 0.1% (v/v) Igepal CA630 (Sigma Aldrich, Paisley, UK)), 2 cycles with 0.2x SSC and 2 cycles with 0.1x SSC. Slides were then further washed with 0.01x SSC for 5 minutes whilst rocking and dried by centrifugation (1000 g, 3 minutes).!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned using an Agilent G2505B Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Laser power was set at 100%, PMT (photo multiplier tube) set at 100% and the split and rotate TIFF mode selected. Red and green channel TIFF format images were collected.!Sample_description = sample id: D115!Sample_data_processing = Spot detection, intensity assessment analysis and quality control were fully automated using BlueFuse version 3.4 Build 5836 (BlueGnome, Cambridge, UK). Spots were excluded if the quality flag was <1 or the confidence level <0.1. Oligonucleotides from the human library were mapped to the human genome build NCBI35. Oligonucleotide sequences and mapping are available from Compugen, San Jose, CA, USA. The raw data were analyzed using snapCGH package of Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/) and re-scaled using global median normalization to account for the differences in individual hybridization intensities. MA plots were constructed to show the relationship between A (the âaverage signalâ [0.5 x (log R + log G)], where R is the background subtracted red signal, G the background subtracted green and M the log2 R/G ratio. Each plot was reviewed by 2 independent reviewers (Rees JR and Chin SF). A cut-off of 2 times the standard deviation (SD, 0.29) above/below the mean log2 ratio (0.03) was employed for genomic gains/losses covering at least 5 oligonucleotides. A cut off of 3 SD from the mean was set for detection of high-level gains or amplifications and homozygous deletions (HDs).
