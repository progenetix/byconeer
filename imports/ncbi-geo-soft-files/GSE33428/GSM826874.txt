After hybridization, slides were washed sequentially using Oligo aCGH Wash Buffer 1 and 2 set (Agilent Technologies).!Sample_scan_protocol = The microarray slides were scanned on an Agilent G2655AA scanner, and raw data were extracted using Feature Extraction Software (v 9.5.3) at the default CGH parameter settings (Agilent Technologies).!Sample_description = a pair of gastric tissues!Sample_data_processing = Putative CNV intervals in each sample were identified using Agilent CGH Analytics software ver. 4.0.76. Cy5/Cy3 ratios were converted into log2-transformed values. Centralization and fuzzy zero corrections were applied to the microarray.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Cheng,,Lei!Sample_contact_email = chenglei_2008@126.com!Sample_contact_institute = National Engineering Center for Biochip at Shanghai!Sample_contact_address = 151 Li Bing Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 201203!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM826nnn/GSM826874/suppl/GSM826874_736.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33428!Sample_series_id = GSE33429!Sample_data_row_count = 208656#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 Cy5/Cy3 ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_14_P112718	0.11501804A_16_P15000916	0.21161711A_16_P15001074	-0.20728603A_16_P00000012	-0.29228073A_16_P00000014	-0.32974762A_16_P00000017	-0.32085264A_16_P00000021	0.14950141A_16_P00000023	0.60012877A_16_P00000027	-0.17711727A_16_P00000033	-0.25075755A_16_P35001586	-0.17224504A_16_P15001533	-0.07396375A_16_P00000060	-0.30443877A_16_P15001594	0.17324953A_16_P00000082	-0.0881497A_16_P00000090	-0.4547769A_16_P00000099	-0.10628666A_16_P15001666	-0.026131742A_16_P00000112	-0.7422857A_16_P00000114	-0.20194496!sample_table_end
