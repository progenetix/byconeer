Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692783/suppl/GSM692783_JB0717_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692783/suppl/GSM692783_JB0717_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	5336.6548943806456	4863.5439325732814	5030.6751021304726	5125.3179527555167	1.4066844039952497	1.4082634802879548	0.998878706779797842	768.68989072764896	840.95110823473669	792.27808902983043	844.10133092068963	0.2394878086172075	0.2475538878328658	0.967416875225550753	15709.981112838854	10783.833673620353	14711.952236542616	11327.677312332258	4.2223518977257326	3.4196450918016206	1.23473395173333914	5977.0698108707084	4961.2115487215606	5622.6785858700114	5231.1430116061438	1.3140548997457018	1.1734579728261119	1.11981419886813785	4710.0574026147233	4419.69608315609	4449.5594890175553	4658.2546225444503	1.4499444879321266	1.5075646461609993	0.961779311835414876	9769.8583977061553	7833.2675135602485	9089.873990238957	8264.6426568147999	3.0776980309529662	2.802343702941744	1.09825858538414517	4600.8603823309859	4023.2227380065515	4348.9484601960557	4236.6389996495491	1.1238743767497061	1.1010106714929675	1.02076610685865158	2615.2654497190333	2267.7934717353705	2497.0272113072992	2388.4355873267582	0.72697487529128024	0.69212141424416462	1.05035743777004449	8029.2877859312885	7556.6369433409345	7505.8094166901474	7977.3469417231045	2.3224666226530322	2.5191559332099582	0.9219225344632393510	15500.297771937685	15237.442517334592	14376.427776647673	15929.410455862431	4.0191703894612987	4.2982570995407423	0.9350697960554140711	16071.071271179948	15303.307158394073	14954.559432396456	16011.018479949416	3.9502698298697196	4.1595862388969458	0.9496785504601693612	14002.371697472277	12666.839118483136	12961.710371535823	13342.324646278017	3.035978953197418	3.0732102620318997	0.987885206132994813	10663.383720112912	10318.520380096803	9908.304103077051	10879.70719444838	2.7019163437089673	2.828275591992305	0.9553228657627642614	9088.0327356411399	8993.4206625698553	8466.184070074296	9489.2682797680154	1.9311302112568569	2.1637278356070033	0.8925014410211650215	8547.2526880441474	7632.0608915943985	7980.5409511957714	8058.4964934337786	2.355758198636217	2.3624330278037986	0.9971745953899963116	7199.321508318938	6545.3027150982743	6746.3231073564048	6909.926059737335	2.2556322176841719	2.294344632550442	0.9831270270747266617	5045.7665646644946	3824.1736163191563	4761.1649375101297	4028.9206715132414	2.2511547141796653	2.0215443064508318	1.113581684554791718	7504.03384241816	6247.5058569026405	7020.8637516089311	6591.2844856963857	2.1528345706062009	2.0669019747897699	1.041575554556800819	8966.6514817129137	7657.6553698599837	8358.5754520957216	8081.7469023557069	2.2530764238251848	2.122124713049367	1.061707829879445820	5016.7604593179803	3774.9374289234233	4734.4235295302706	3975.6303567012837	1.5420570166341823	1.2725523618028105	1.2117827626751385!sample_table_end
