Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692790/suppl/GSM692790_JB0726_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692790/suppl/GSM692790_JB0726_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	225.41855900168048	203.56758954420695	221.73337974275202	206.04539508018124	0.93476096827284205	0.87920247486188052	1.06319192108699382	120.11355615868997	122.18565194703704	122.19644670853747	122.3397966945172	0.5802934477566557	0.56638988737526041	1.02454768471560563	1106.1372448862364	948.96221352937187	1055.4257149308305	950.2818212158528	5.2263544734969392	4.6408152260560813	1.12617163556810444	448.12093531392424	289.18279768372651	434.9288946296374	293.67887008538992	1.742680041987956	1.1734720993516845	1.4850630389514555	521.76059716026339	550.64332312510066	507.3876091529803	557.14839942942535	2.4990621424465265	2.7427362702007754	0.911156559089652766	546.42345515830584	425.66283106397742	531.82113756539309	432.65238801799541	2.7053979666781998	2.1758641291759448	1.24336714338077857	550.38979434447936	604.02919913137237	536.91775269721052	607.51333029795694	2.1630930052598605	2.4875007167581367	0.869584877177015058	337.33477143023703	286.25029005024527	328.85047234154513	290.81915026254421	1.5415452690490343	1.3641864965704384	1.13001064951491279	352.85622214752226	362.48407909188654	343.6769951133378	368.51653382635698	1.641420880431667	1.7556549142348181	0.9349336632860227910	899.68215067166068	980.10394889106692	871.80144308701381	970.85480681264005	3.8017576133334883	4.2706622313819107	0.8902033004149116911	437.41043233215152	447.27739084280483	424.34660250159391	454.71544222127358	1.7445736408260799	1.8464118633712108	0.9448453378331351812	615.79789813108891	516.61964508703011	600.31456026387968	524.51145378510012	2.3201000169748638	2.0396194053100412	1.13751615175586513	733.42406852429463	701.36723608508669	713.94855936694682	701.23100689343789	3.0437183771119218	2.9951033949626118	1.016231487110286414	453.18784376221424	452.33958092707866	439.48233156779202	459.65649245705384	1.7884556720497173	1.876427313791925	0.9531174796403744115	343.15659556577725	314.95604846326512	334.3088424505458	320.12317540777212	1.5061501105073076	1.429314468879801	1.053756988612677416	696.16687699751549	655.84641389186299	680.12607789902052	658.35775088802484	3.1338597671582473	3.064825952883766	1.022524546364378617	308.25480224226209	303.5105802439225	300.64032496785109	308.59159670609989	1.9257190633880088	1.9183496156820388	1.00384155611976418	460.64533030656662	393.97185636942629	449.02467289027021	399.98724807150205	2.176753920629027	1.9452969304860865	1.118982858871372419	615.80310348441174	514.78151963941332	599.70329366918759	522.12986020953429	2.6752759414363836	2.3980292828303025	1.11561437576727920	614.90285305741952	505.07305439456343	599.4348365698736	512.55298052221417	2.7619307790018706	2.3279670219232913	1.1864131892727812!sample_table_end
