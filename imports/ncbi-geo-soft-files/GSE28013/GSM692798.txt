Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692798/suppl/GSM692798_JB0736_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692798/suppl/GSM692798_JB0736_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	973.13222978097679	756.61648682108876	928.29257968485081	782.21183097551773	1.4539045797701156	1.2165319288808698	1.19512241746717912	166.87455870454767	173.65570310736902	175.63461242433635	171.39492048697616	0.30956809767922477	0.29566232752596017	1.04703260733156373	2553.3636474565169	1947.4666139485814	2364.7041058263294	2017.7445518733341	4.1055528781812862	3.5768387610644856	1.14781603321684344	1116.9155623123067	904.93490397517371	1058.093245719492	938.54666316555733	1.5148933804967493	1.3192291564828771	1.14831708581663095	774.80287318596538	808.3858972923806	744.01939525610987	835.57707336400279	1.3691861146346529	1.5182094126190204	0.901842725551746056	1565.4096059410494	1380.3158377170689	1456.7301993300948	1435.3703120556772	2.7660784066229906	2.6256778867477828	1.05347210355993487	708.58725815881314	669.01925423625892	684.3650657085077	689.99963568814269	0.98674318004846584	1.0165161235782165	0.970710800508557078	490.36267263701853	378.40757701947541	479.19841053459447	388.98917726917585	0.81461426723963448	0.65247911242327228	1.24849095048299869	1260.4771915046747	1230.3565814910787	1186.6869204158293	1278.7492961406924	2.0815185053001777	2.2030463541813154	0.9448364540081137810	3372.3801120387607	2872.7353119871432	3121.1951688022236	2945.5931388428253	4.9000486510626748	4.5301479988477631	1.081653105441366911	2647.7882629002529	2408.7494325153471	2399.8791965670734	2493.4202865456678	3.7028472518642883	3.839623954361735	0.9643775786058239612	2832.2254122817712	2148.5727819979438	2586.0614488753249	2230.612276430164	3.5899887967506641	3.0720131955960071	1.168611125074989513	1989.6787378356053	1971.1013067612419	1824.6152068638833	2048.180959105383	2.8507089373018171	3.1463530679074632	0.9060359329595932814	1394.7631228023436	1931.0590790818953	1307.3499235690747	2008.8972046016775	1.8966503415065412	2.9074284845525864	0.6523463437135618215	1605.2236369877996	1589.2882157471986	1491.9197744277085	1653.4012588455375	2.3682580396527548	2.6118168862729494	0.9067473497471136816	1459.1692221476342	1190.2393627316656	1362.6177798503629	1236.4542716732674	2.3864828266246598	2.2154070951541218	1.077220900774733817	807.42474612711862	826.75910239261509	775.82166221658326	856.55996165348529	2.0456358697755506	2.3535992907036856	0.869152144060997518	1094.2671640486906	1128.9308456086117	1035.8593049369883	1171.2521638155074	1.9473368647242224	2.1924063435612715	0.8882189519489500619	1608.7351836507405	1495.5927694126667	1494.095406136099	1555.54851718502	2.256988742893387	2.3633631296384809	0.9549902486794884520	1203.9795107487969	837.52801267909558	1136.5890403736908	867.79391040277631	1.9564217773719477	1.4539988332756499	1.3455456308478675!sample_table_end
