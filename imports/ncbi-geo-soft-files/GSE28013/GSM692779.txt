Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692779/suppl/GSM692779_JB0178_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692779/suppl/GSM692779_JB0178_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	5769.0137548569628	4732.4935495018899	4995.8943644152114	5174.574951487798	2.8518404907448796	3.0968040619302144	0.920897943077273242	112.11803712140963	328.09594777463639	179.02618271572044	246.68728712245809	0.12163331906606865	0.17059492977595633	0.712994924443596913	26754.199970588634	12481.350864147209	20038.807058152306	14025.456570467159	12.975131803993158	8.9422435925763946	1.45099288222977464	939.50463423084705	843.74464376641083	947.54682220439327	834.76396621960248	0.63854615067371634	0.55134498974544133	1.15816079324224245	3825.1947392420971	4106.1064586088551	3477.5365607432918	4486.4447895163794	2.1486565568914697	2.7997597792752975	0.767443183088956986	5339.797828594269	3139.6820889748083	4648.9868915130337	3469.552297538582	2.9849735400329722	2.2898741660233446	1.30355352460993777	1492.0573684714052	1268.4992246690629	1440.3695768387561	1314.091318151286	0.85165754229138668	0.79476391298821569	1.07158557198358188	462.53087229617148	532.0887241117274	512.63492361554552	485.28373885207765	0.32044048333633574	0.30499520511785594	1.05064105257822449	3473.4957926833531	2421.3302260646192	3175.5492196831378	2623.8791813232424	1.9812840712896851	1.6983925112616152	1.166564300155757110	7203.6566859607183	5527.3609032567974	6213.9195184157825	6091.513323644057	3.8731384623267839	3.8193521193397659	1.014082582937211811	28946.888281449777	23057.636908005177	21379.109747658531	26635.248759936723	13.359731359460966	16.383604829979173	0.8154329586255009112	3775.1929914200105	2316.6078281627947	3435.9200492056384	2495.4447100872662	2.3651436080619632	1.6918853230214754	1.397933758204214613	6763.5198422194471	6145.3328079425128	5842.240691644527	6802.7667694986785	3.7982534364582374	4.4403657180130605	0.8553920279696799514	5279.7469287641761	4599.8796722069092	4607.6640923840105	5028.9350644262304	2.8613158099837923	3.1530729169918419	0.9074689629168496415	7500.1371096366111	6044.8012489337361	6484.3667194899845	6681.0133608377309	4.1665273881589071	4.4036704982440087	0.9461487615434298616	2666.7861178992371	2595.6129306385551	2467.8282879514491	2831.3866486579004	1.5606988258748429	1.9138076499706138	0.8154940889168287317	4586.5142402060337	2672.74061709017	4091.1816408353961	2912.3846317023667	2.9376688750215769	2.1728900466229377	1.351963887720523618	4733.4506786833672	3191.7856353093875	4182.8235141069508	3492.3831027615479	3.1208579723637779	2.7408426402444817	1.138649087889773719	6714.8476901506265	4640.9613419120924	5797.2321113290391	5074.2222415860879	3.7482808677258452	3.2371884229004744	1.157881586752815420	3233.1263817841668	2070.5850903519422	2967.3278650321158	2221.5729592216339	1.7009627233597409	1.3056328056000934	1.3027879784147629!sample_table_end
