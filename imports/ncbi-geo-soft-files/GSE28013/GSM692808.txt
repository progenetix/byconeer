Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692808/suppl/GSM692808_JB0788_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692808/suppl/GSM692808_JB0788_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	1335.4258511236148	1125.6663670476778	1259.9904130328168	1169.5702036629043	1.2445043001878326	1.2139848362896539	1.02513990536443322	347.62779205837865	380.70601695372994	353.87831418068725	406.77875137016326	0.35071867954463909	0.41781786180096275	0.839405663589633873	2519.1725017241038	2616.3490398512827	2307.1218074129097	2679.0762701964704	2.1667804891574711	2.6424831388030743	0.819978927146125414	1495.0669526576023	1206.6601254700006	1400.4144748298067	1245.0574003522502	1.6513943866870235	1.403464313994556	1.17665577259090135	1808.1148745199716	1840.5934101158346	1682.068483667297	1886.3005760947003	1.5647449564061706	1.8163303592188034	0.861486980308560866	2768.0084535625147	2018.8099294672097	2522.7445704167626	2071.6393385752581	2.5042220237296715	2.132556505531972	1.1742816742410247	721.80902293467079	701.89566846189462	697.24104336227731	737.72494901493496	0.69865590278137391	0.7401514199868886	0.94393644856312028	466.59364425009272	485.93396709629224	462.65432453789015	516.42490398244786	0.46883722625463425	0.53298931507266911	0.879637195336105079	1687.0066394954395	2135.252895766439	1571.8813693088987	2189.613142091011	1.4829341289715874	2.1637177454806782	0.6853639445666920310	2901.6509824551622	3139.6266673704372	2644.8125635341735	3218.6671424128886	3.0399057751984047	3.7444979125786109	0.8118326798865818111	2429.389450537446	3035.1320664739487	2227.5420705520323	3112.5946095410327	2.6011683933206364	3.406389176765904	0.7636145661401612112	4555.8749970195295	3785.3137305197756	4125.8042940861369	3893.028776680555	4.8702445392246041	4.340984119041333	1.121921759137914313	1631.6034909545485	1999.3093054141102	1526.2083408149601	2047.1503656810473	1.9194056727119464	2.3786672112806753	0.8069248458167198614	1838.9003053580616	2317.9336046633771	1707.9371274321245	2375.7774050263779	2.053553864703233	2.7779914176633262	0.739222537422579615	1576.0128662740656	1782.985720342411	1473.8002969385964	1827.0708178258312	1.3570715345199551	1.8021738138560532	0.7530192282709250516	1837.6955097979269	1768.0242899879045	1706.4128292722435	1815.5999667170768	1.64026054047991	1.8845839938659348	0.8703568245399172517	1458.8353996866101	1967.176015838676	1367.5452509403176	2018.0264772916214	1.1406237440526148	1.8604772430452527	0.6130812662807030318	1562.6929466314828	1368.0710257151115	1462.4824126195572	1403.4813884623886	1.6712610364361888	1.5732754366549804	1.062281274783988719	1566.1386391349058	2147.6879630298181	1464.3233961072849	2202.2214396472255	1.4068454513879629	2.215362481912603	0.6350407497076424620	1434.6408058828865	1368.0769753541858	1346.9934347633709	1399.9052261372074	1.188933536137236	1.305959887887711	0.91039054657355822!sample_table_end
