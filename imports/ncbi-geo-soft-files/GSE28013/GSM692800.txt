Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692800/suppl/GSM692800_JB0738_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692800/suppl/GSM692800_JB0738_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	310.45881898323586	424.36213422248812	331.3678914700273	399.96383679858508	1.2201035093347625	1.4634409602626957	0.833722399785603472	78.656535468956733	134.20604734073126	102.87152776905798	107.29459081535778	0.40635848773071598	0.42103126893476295	0.96515037650013483	1190.1844584300434	753.09694163788299	1151.5225294178381	733.66087511275794	4.2595756928624207	2.8134511984317627	1.51400375995032024	346.23980777453426	439.67104657414444	365.11605725885983	415.74039149367678	1.0925144225410275	1.2314284035723679	0.887192807451613445	277.65918823735853	341.46894109308249	300.68462538320523	316.475219965885	1.1819647500744404	1.3071014886225152	0.904263946114888366	495.61825543080562	678.72218724716879	504.53253921531171	658.47163864147888	2.0095105811861731	2.7138572782999653	0.74046288183768667	242.28959825030336	362.13000679312756	266.07929221426207	337.2055812140004	0.87807939198978868	1.1024617981171796	0.796471490884674178	143.87491212216952	188.25246000753688	169.70600123439834	161.74899855286881	0.62602692425908713	0.5892539488201346	1.06240598898417779	511.66981504254937	691.73517393277143	519.30603983165327	672.98090875210949	1.9896989107927636	2.5736815219622922	0.7730944539228482610	1347.7542439849594	1116.2534156783104	1292.8722744543325	1100.1905576149011	4.1460711326482187	3.5986857422358351	1.152107027292773611	961.56576844663493	1065.0254120506511	922.3707080521832	1054.6979913752275	3.1503887425453616	3.5125470203481055	0.8968958206951339612	1009.0790995030364	1362.6629623831341	965.5180621235022	1346.6341177928512	2.8969388787483612	4.0905490337827395	0.7082029465539528813	835.77023682903371	954.95967717482574	811.84222021416576	939.97291754657192	2.714245579693805	3.2055589657527359	0.8467308225155173514	658.69555384423097	905.61003582552394	653.2289971051074	892.5607356889501	2.0205680600561076	2.7425833297064988	0.7367389855287793715	641.80420520986036	684.45986276899373	638.11369866357188	666.03409710808864	2.4098298588282043	2.4411446440567595	0.9871720894110906916	533.75741665062765	486.81868223472526	539.68966857460373	463.73696815448068	2.0474515443587724	1.8086910716423592	1.132007326436133417	650.0366190036965	538.58565106503204	645.30086675926475	517.04083589329105	3.1451351408352837	2.6239288507472738	1.198635831889868218	443.65874220728671	517.80803136163388	456.53786863431128	494.95970563926545	1.6401315829063849	1.7794754261644421	0.9216938648271165719	697.95663349289964	699.00054822967002	688.91399273317461	680.17383413270397	2.3402850503837258	2.2543993693720998	1.038096923809709520	508.74136997305283	361.88294958770609	516.81049158597762	337.16578750482643	2.0439021354026634	1.3306736055661785	1.5359905891670698!sample_table_end
