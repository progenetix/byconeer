Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692803/suppl/GSM692803_JB0783_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692803/suppl/GSM692803_JB0783_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	905.4496223966197	700.16915200436529	939.65776388476513	658.01699021754666	1.7104923870794577	1.2478128472946792	1.37079241553562372	167.322714832184	185.38380486126107	185.07855796975778	185.78293510043034	0.35947998984556179	0.37362781845767462	0.962133899262333723	1311.8939018576802	1702.8243034266238	1350.6611149294004	1552.8803466688685	2.5373933870425156	2.9381869871004835	0.863591527081982394	1935.1953856929238	778.61578650033823	1973.5361853719742	731.33587847372212	3.3945085648905202	1.2624129314227817	2.68890509626259675	1391.3856463434613	922.61341216439303	1430.7501081063833	859.12829470538929	2.6910342105915386	1.6656760095324463	1.61558081835308986	1932.7142792195712	1088.8528720276834	1973.3435136872931	1007.8574911547947	3.9580605244792713	2.0004515054402181	1.97858359161186647	635.81745045954131	468.45448766896408	662.80744494197734	451.24088042486761	1.1805807291025756	0.79913642725257683	1.47732062867087738	440.35807655252097	283.95202609234497	461.57481373243428	280.32161570677829	0.87734303343498254	0.53423115653238962	1.64225358762240319	1097.1485867509521	1464.2199879408586	1135.4215640953157	1338.7665953388077	2.0575706371068105	2.4201014763363653	0.8502001495497756310	2343.9452984509521	2371.8349268036741	2394.9218431420713	2164.1998634309011	4.3158708141615207	4.0426039941527101	1.067596732305234211	1712.0850317105112	2241.187642177219	1752.0538482870174	2042.5704852510994	3.2427057691427854	3.6268449512087808	0.8940844763882264112	4634.7256046712446	1960.1737418082171	4824.6753100828601	1788.1874047092072	8.4431382874259828	3.1124947616940157	2.712659436840528613	1419.2462059544403	1627.7078837230817	1458.0700484401955	1488.057241817706	2.6418669942289967	2.7662103777280098	0.9550491949201851414	1481.0183550557972	1670.0940750059654	1520.3986772698645	1522.9206248070177	2.8178543653556605	2.8153353238364667	1.000894757188554315	997.86124686176356	1221.5547913630892	1034.1439280615496	1124.8791849767122	1.9299420372776741	2.1527559786077832	0.8964982824136873416	1235.0373582662826	1213.7751070481454	1273.6315235788954	1117.538552024339	2.3032072141175126	2.035945507551828	1.131271542177501717	644.8429261429992	1150.7678874193214	670.90323155827764	1062.5141375042206	1.3659810795143934	2.1761468308813217	0.6277063018588603418	1172.790412365594	877.31964374431652	1211.3626148567421	817.88298748750344	2.3198001156908741	1.5703751808631785	1.477226680579454519	910.2750863428455	1373.0604354924897	944.29700498383545	1259.5567026962294	1.6360103374095809	2.2850228508056811	0.7159711058612550120	731.45664807175092	754.17875394213479	760.73637639499896	707.21981093014188	1.4010379323602287	1.3398671845809111	1.045654336850149!sample_table_end
