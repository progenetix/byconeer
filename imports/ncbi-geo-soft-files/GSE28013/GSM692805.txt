Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692805/suppl/GSM692805_JB0785_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692805/suppl/GSM692805_JB0785_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	1181.0373417749015	903.72344867884908	1158.2050364096447	914.4423565533865	1.313651927600495	1.0487853159227445	1.25254607178087232	526.80230524234571	570.01470147719169	527.08659903227942	574.97159830908038	0.59463490127238472	0.66811463620082046	0.890019270725347143	1951.9337788218513	1901.5663299118778	1865.4972187331668	1872.4996538381349	2.2425370884382496	2.2826589356544353	0.982423196654789394	2288.4535473327023	1140.1824433780948	2166.4628680146643	1143.2831462994968	2.6118981371567842	1.319411755219613	1.97959289571589445	1774.141014655934	1504.4983688703119	1707.2849112790393	1491.3872066695374	2.0103886645513906	1.8086250411368978	1.11155635846314766	2614.3566176047298	1643.3876755666492	2458.563501083594	1624.127365241178	2.9544313419801815	2.0162047016006417	1.46534294837954337	1053.4337791096416	1054.7480834198061	1037.3753155665895	1061.0916679793156	1.1666940467859006	1.2144993182916914	0.960637877036412468	540.64341361073093	564.47573346718309	543.52576246413071	569.79952086710773	0.67641710035786273	0.69659534319562055	0.971033049481510489	1578.1599227904005	1789.7629424627057	1528.5433007643526	1765.3662211950991	1.8120110124742921	2.1743209974249704	0.8333686767594302710	4059.9961297403938	3550.853315244718	3909.4865132676578	3489.9813202789173	4.6891306090352529	4.260114290549379	1.100705354182070411	2255.1098389596323	2128.4670704323294	2137.0598473183672	2089.8491276319955	2.6112834370374536	2.6481532274980384	0.9860771687688861812	4485.8602390944288	2117.8265388047425	4353.4144775803679	2081.6539321975224	5.0889885219501991	2.4029395569246197	2.117817948139858713	1973.4206175135232	1857.0426537364044	1886.5038646028243	1829.2695624596299	2.1242455569320278	2.1274009336697799	0.99851679263282614	1953.4119547932671	1603.1083196681661	1869.3656011879063	1585.6171749117864	2.0981748987348445	1.7981980372817261	1.166820814634289515	1164.5736540234657	1143.4516269601513	1143.261476399377	1145.6465369127745	1.3264505896191079	1.3887038809917382	0.9551716588217694616	1631.9092123210933	1584.4107825143674	1577.4030993146123	1567.4416179902018	1.8318493519360448	1.8690874981330812	0.9800768309486679317	901.73750268239451	1026.2149326276465	891.17986187453937	1033.4908759424084	1.1369502942047613	1.4032834314542733	0.8102071675046421718	1699.1597468056466	1328.8989368547004	1638.5992221609265	1323.2251733780372	1.9665002062128576	1.5858749793875058	1.240009604648883819	1331.9584841195942	1451.576151169641	1299.9860273063948	1440.6591012947194	1.4342745458794819	1.5917977898604176	0.9010406692455901220	1187.8046621377025	1072.0853490637699	1164.8510581465821	1077.7811300786323	1.4277226982254052	1.3381711299313523	1.0669208640741239!sample_table_end
