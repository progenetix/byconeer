Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692786/suppl/GSM692786_JB0722_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692786/suppl/GSM692786_JB0722_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	1090.2337459735866	731.26046568449271	1048.3006005294544	752.78508374775549	1.2603731658440713	0.94634894214846677	1.3318270985569922	295.11147924843095	351.09814687190402	316.63944953650474	342.47892797369707	0.32279755560513701	0.3712422318189032	0.869506559163780393	4641.2384825255094	4467.1445595281766	4780.8948845703744	4147.8776299894316	5.2094409043208021	4.6564451197543333	1.1187592187483244	2619.690057106719	997.30974952603196	2550.8171062620463	1033.0957204100307	2.4053295916969675	1.0006186448339944	2.40384246697303895	1943.7165348124458	1725.6384512806596	1863.2760304594619	1741.1179007776814	2.2147786855574521	2.1806628393863829	1.0156447138708846	3537.7824323106124	1706.7178140964429	3526.6458102992019	1726.4663568273245	4.3830465615291985	2.2159283370999772	1.97797306354472017	1294.9294678028248	1177.7769819879397	1249.8894419965775	1199.6568314371834	1.6631219823629135	1.6335660993699594	1.01809286015690068	1208.081816664675	867.17820696234708	1145.7605799662231	898.25631024460995	1.1440713075008171	0.95251427384898846	1.20110673289731539	1789.5767675268348	1365.6401074884875	1720.8266983717974	1393.4275596070433	2.4257246038532188	1.9928569982994244	1.217209566929877910	3899.0678415336452	5395.7472118796359	3937.8697202565622	4897.3941201689322	4.3642005758566249	5.5897025877956796	0.7807572061857526211	1881.0503424328811	2394.1544118713691	1800.5850065519483	2363.7345868742618	2.5945472947098644	3.4176542020349108	0.7591602723192536512	4166.3416719078568	2044.1385563763736	4240.6165934965902	2044.2956334600519	4.7343647340308834	2.2562876069762043	2.09829842587120713	2645.0990160452648	3071.7146045345989	2577.4857146249688	2973.779176473839	2.5994807690585411	3.0862645355679028	0.8422741275417634514	1686.949527607964	1615.6040711940279	1626.2169973628002	1624.7720243983435	1.6830486952795676	1.6799507842834565	1.001844048662075715	1537.991176266155	1535.638626786752	1459.9075660248652	1564.6252777550642	1.7615469072297862	1.9891654142218873	0.885570850284896916	1215.4286223815111	1486.2649361432443	1166.3155736577824	1507.3396055667311	2.0332619113144887	2.6655770943967325	0.7627848827139820417	931.0646818880341	1065.9047210811841	888.53075249024857	1102.3346338468784	1.5371552604798298	2.0607215810715682	0.7459305879062587718	1888.2981926236164	1478.5762592557237	1829.0748399533275	1499.9254284127692	2.3073508618295713	1.9896949334732379	1.159650569045692219	2373.5645851439626	2408.948298530524	2300.2412025260901	2376.1328661099778	2.1179810945657969	2.306896146900951	0.9181085578607688420	1242.1869359590196	1079.8419229352703	1177.6435205369271	1118.22231795226	1.7078699987551498	1.633159935260257	1.0457457116611102!sample_table_end
