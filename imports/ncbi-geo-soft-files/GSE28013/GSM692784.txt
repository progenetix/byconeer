Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692784/suppl/GSM692784_JB0718_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692784/suppl/GSM692784_JB0718_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	4735.5844906479724	5126.6543837371146	4752.56373709524	5080.1028007373689	1.1486211684246073	1.211345058632425	0.948219634231528332	1015.2443842909056	1157.8741568300186	1092.3498475748413	1110.6730027224085	0.31266952072571547	0.31685150005446877	0.986801453273743693	15075.086054153555	10884.471287547491	14787.827261205653	10852.210088022264	4.3607366665448222	3.1950367073941233	1.36484712568496414	6467.9977968218382	4794.8901695579652	6425.7387460722475	4748.5802965043522	1.5389469709584427	1.1665578897572313	1.3192204042944745	5797.5982575911221	5706.3317642962966	5781.1508195599627	5665.2985773803075	1.6807442036265616	1.6191055135960486	1.03806959429939386	9952.3625257151034	8021.2059469561718	9717.1142242071819	8013.2220240989682	2.9125594446967789	2.3965359420090979	1.21532057735594817	5087.9195544947379	4675.457359858674	5091.6112293904216	4623.1180250196267	1.1342268469170491	1.0429716153624173	1.08749541234918658	3128.5015776043219	2704.2134766378472	3182.412635068797	2669.8095027940462	0.83794012756047065	0.72903014216204165	1.14939023656201819	7797.6765411951883	8301.3769950935875	7685.5432859634593	8288.3672965160004	2.0422667012265623	2.2263761615749837	0.9173053217484242710	14549.67092188547	14573.712126870716	14219.775234553745	14462.670388048888	3.6957862771489793	3.8507474614739343	0.9597581545205665611	12123.8046020161	13162.04718502118	11769.597959272203	13123.447567145993	2.9515523423808014	3.2105465189196969	0.9193301903546179412	13507.173269210754	12785.55447834665	13128.770860704797	12754.254680964948	3.1996795452987548	3.1042927875738839	1.030727371498813713	9895.8849557910598	9395.2329451806017	9663.8275626996547	9383.2574930445207	2.4889243689251002	2.3603737443273163	1.054461978704317514	6726.0013080610843	6921.1522755936485	6671.1130042147506	6894.9323902416836	1.5854790345984502	1.6382986546646918	0.9677594680824221915	7369.8845742720869	7202.1301956199286	7282.8229247174631	7179.5900500276312	1.8457181434922272	1.7897325347905648	1.031281550518504516	8471.1659213411949	8524.8243040986836	8321.116532924465	8511.0708569691051	2.2191395553486957	2.2975149831765989	0.965886869769380117	4536.0462680227347	4013.0241250218019	4554.7324117501021	3966.9933355456487	1.9052297681489629	1.6293352346834855	1.169329507883055718	6228.4655460407621	6132.271239164239	6191.0928997962101	6097.8342361401756	1.8165163278094349	1.8483982729554398	0.9827515824849651919	8537.8616656116155	8261.2781164953976	8385.7180607093433	8255.9418168832708	2.0179453274482948	2.0279570620005849	0.9950631427361615920	6284.4200983400196	5245.3339922109399	6247.328254518573	5200.5094918265586	1.7050446720079524	1.3973062836888992	1.2202368885843853!sample_table_end
