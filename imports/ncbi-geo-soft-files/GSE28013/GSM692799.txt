Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692799/suppl/GSM692799_JB0737_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692799/suppl/GSM692799_JB0737_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	338.50962706705252	270.0022429736253	348.28924704524007	251.77521295801344	1.5747408427526222	1.1139956877036947	1.41359689281982062	80.568477302749784	108.68843404410738	99.442190292905607	88.468829417247576	0.41424168189210547	0.3680941873632167	1.12536871299016973	989.44313406527715	746.22863769415289	918.06373571411484	753.17061133284972	3.6275996440607341	3.0418824232540507	1.19255090740164544	400.21671206312419	363.35367844804648	403.11419915978701	350.96015985111762	1.4366443486422784	1.2544104054095553	1.14527457875576615	300.4022323593565	356.96891237415304	310.69444684643503	344.05354698752467	1.2938860304593847	1.472773004820991	0.878537307666533716	575.68964972877893	659.38905820253467	559.31361438530428	662.03412402798108	2.5121284327284323	2.9387502782301502	0.854828820038887727	167.61783011363502	236.74394458160961	186.09318614932189	219.25439622051735	0.78716056858584482	0.931656738811662	0.844904067983103258	173.93692898682829	177.62547661318217	192.08929067445115	159.19982123723361	0.79282637775443987	0.65023416581616567	1.21929363210143589	464.58819868249196	572.71471030392718	461.08733854246339	569.65125901970339	2.0225204059653334	2.5501678927156477	0.7930930397729901710	1014.0799825335001	922.48794684306336	932.11224885274555	940.70491179433338	3.5858851054519492	3.7108067015311801	0.9663357307111459811	1256.4870037111482	1024.1979425933653	1145.4184848585044	1048.5451898101237	4.5825624972224297	4.1612473247854824	1.101247327917156812	1119.4336426209341	887.96036116562891	1023.6704826896745	903.84513019171072	3.6851809067548951	3.2839535902581649	1.122178132384991513	710.36209070887458	882.39930819292738	675.52339479900843	897.71122181084263	2.4969925281336294	3.4479519464941615	0.7241958608711301914	626.20681516919876	890.07469895531631	602.95861022462145	906.13376209329795	2.2718383119498067	3.3861080903638232	0.6709290581759628215	726.27679430645537	693.62615561745758	689.07218354169981	698.50424404215232	2.7706819884852685	2.8263643591801544	0.9802989411064335616	424.13077400016698	353.13512876501892	424.36972095937193	339.65513976874183	2.2552308563887196	1.7869797438926405	1.262034930220345517	427.59265265113322	530.41102423432233	428.43664525136478	525.83286526635447	2.3419573771677116	3.0212232124363219	0.7751686030768812918	399.43048673398215	399.23868542888852	402.21431878378701	387.8406867265399	1.8666465250617323	1.7722664340505321	1.053253895237125119	641.08572697426462	670.79006058523453	615.9331896308147	674.17508176885906	2.3761626226209644	2.5955212784750734	0.915485703132826420	386.01756751656933	304.90057122210715	390.18841723593823	290.2672345717699	1.6773509268175772	1.2667972620191355	1.3240879003354209!sample_table_end
