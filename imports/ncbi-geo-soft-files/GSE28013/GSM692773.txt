Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692773/suppl/GSM692773_JB0172_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692773/suppl/GSM692773_JB0172_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	1243.6092688475824	986.32820392648648	1195.1427896840421	980.86586902784848	1.3283912864269551	1.0648153239541032	1.24753208987835042	1332.8300691980996	618.21695016505134	1015.9781387993622	706.32200407379617	1.2013069157190739	0.72292996655379926	1.6617196288676393	1631.1552919764861	945.54943941174918	1587.7083610804129	940.15020290593827	1.7856449100733724	1.0748813395796035	1.66124840419292744	961.93022714426741	1857.047652878121	892.68778815903045	1528.7816586086319	1.1766558375526852	1.7039174905807106	0.690559163842886745	1008.423767683797	1661.1443902591564	982.58692509551247	1408.5418534447531	1.1731844391202366	1.5953946227524329	0.735356896901292136	1197.9050565166617	2324.774433034841	1197.989347922017	1782.0854445270309	1.5683363148451241	2.1170180183515201	0.740823319050612617	672.23063670179295	884.62546040412849	593.86647004806662	907.85019625880511	0.62302952681677914	1.1444889126272388	0.544373580156910188	773.90867430633295	787.66631868880711	716.53818424364545	829.03206372253067	0.89292502118903061	0.98376532737043609	0.907660593787933299	1273.0926656556751	762.33439652896504	1228.8783848065714	820.0774167646432	1.1005847064944161	0.70948744810118536	1.551239150798131310	1012.1395446510999	1347.1569642755419	962.51567075008109	1208.4429349781192	1.0970163885135817	1.7157331966233382	0.6393863513701156811	1220.8579714859657	1555.1163208634985	1224.5255800389114	1332.8598657091461	1.3846088898534616	1.5265122819543988	0.9070407793121338912	979.36501180048901	1861.6945570286377	937.32736650675872	1558.0633888874504	1.3295876434125731	2.1300012377902942	0.6242191881502913213	828.90762282023138	785.81524330227728	767.49591997378093	830.30070431632805	1.0416091377945507	1.3062804198034936	0.7973855552020309214	863.59861719629191	1157.4656935986898	792.51093486764978	1085.4445457602469	0.96396090492339803	1.2073066955235123	0.7984391277689428815	823.65236051115357	650.25271268779977	774.70358331903731	725.58013521353234	0.92832495727579778	1.0228106455929642	0.9076215243512748616	1904.1295463948225	1751.7908628772411	1937.3797168328722	1448.1391799003079	1.6941540601626548	1.2605133093416556	1.344019176638033417	952.45099474431674	966.22642381863818	911.38408236766293	954.96258624800487	0.89088525705607413	0.93007002072476508	0.9578690176056250418	1405.5967658611532	1717.0551909106698	1369.3633620026312	1442.3721945520131	1.2858988851275888	1.2751460952190057	1.008432594468115819	790.07890219750857	927.4909728804314	729.9466462407172	926.29055848131679	1.0116972745209667	1.0725845041249129	0.9432331631029647920	1026.6775422280211	948.64189105265586	989.08203165692566	941.23301869503575	1.0758209165371424	1.2608030737383951	0.85328227615057772!sample_table_end
