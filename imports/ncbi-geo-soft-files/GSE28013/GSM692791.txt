Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692791/suppl/GSM692791_JB0727_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692791/suppl/GSM692791_JB0727_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	289.88739164176593	427.04792693172112	286.49584197273185	437.93791141870514	0.61594544549600894	0.93607052334577157	0.658011795195143862	179.01989825171614	167.36616941649413	178.70770842377053	173.66755662264765	0.37410539913633828	0.37365574466329515	1.00120339237243173	1924.4336327954763	1663.7302682320906	1777.3127710233225	1689.2539168080618	4.4866859781801223	3.9892069286378873	1.12470625325823774	1419.8799920554429	941.06494368486597	1331.6734911127787	965.37914795988002	2.625766844974788	1.9986785587837235	1.31375144514117055	799.58484375921762	900.90304473108699	763.12027065563575	922.93374027265634	1.7692178085724144	2.0632476722958635	0.857491726431335536	1213.8691373436029	1158.6324084865066	1144.2187507014385	1181.408080455614	2.8823077805656721	2.9265695847863711	0.984875875000276187	803.11496671845805	792.01483186701455	767.21179642713935	813.00585465041434	1.5263386242789965	1.6801837058324633	0.908435559147835588	677.23233428490687	517.99771032509216	649.99161768298779	531.01690840017454	1.3573307527605458	1.1709015319038807	1.15921853014705019	691.74101220838611	872.74714877134772	663.54971148021605	895.39145243841403	1.587851349770816	2.1563930975140302	0.7363459619683210310	1672.8507602695952	1882.8554540276896	1562.3134197842819	1900.1078522525854	3.2294616837611012	4.0216153146813607	0.8030260059860989711	654.61134295218881	738.45290570708926	629.28814832057526	757.84435222354011	1.2305566285110177	1.5121080410719201	0.8138020532174982112	1576.8444643184694	1748.9076239254739	1474.2232450973966	1766.1174700974261	2.6419628808826747	3.2029322496826826	0.8248575601761217713	1114.8573795951525	970.54252928607332	1053.3031879896664	995.4624681659717	2.1447418181245057	2.0191733241387704	1.062188070971714914	738.98082703844204	727.01216151208257	706.72720715211778	746.09017280434182	1.3333299172191562	1.4911623575250503	0.8941547581928933615	555.40051091627322	547.45149056162279	537.8763229086959	561.07574760920158	1.1847101100196615	1.2627537847349113	0.9381956517108096516	891.70555662583047	872.6271251776335	848.5039347024167	895.03661566165079	2.1271134499663442	2.3066816068092595	0.9221530373707258517	398.08648768991077	415.67615538087313	391.34488632071952	426.36440631359403	1.3257405251477798	1.3727384083422931	0.9657634091762118418	703.55850455511199	761.87293558142335	675.35430577038903	780.41916492271002	1.8131508850672258	2.1220292351534473	0.8544419911991051319	1015.531652252248	862.42435633271077	961.20129510228946	884.75086426969131	1.7990797383032642	1.7648084907724402	1.019419244473276120	800.52128900072921	664.6201364819251	763.41825892859413	681.6777197286367	1.6566200465993823	1.5009408606457018	1.1037210659230823!sample_table_end
