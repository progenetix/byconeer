Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692774/suppl/GSM692774_JB0173_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692774/suppl/GSM692774_JB0173_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	8570.6031911562004	7815.4019009427429	8772.3102601526352	6485.6623914726088	1.8849087629480452	1.3658539970335324	1.38002214515009382	1916.5598110788717	3532.8507533936731	2204.7617854381597	3446.0720493289896	0.49901367979888461	0.79164186035117745	0.630352820879783953	9110.0806842776437	7027.9816249540554	9288.3666805613666	5992.8081164747009	2.0119987402071282	1.526791814964831	1.31779507886179854	3365.1128919808498	13719.615220206846	3677.6719360135639	10271.746409003161	1.0206807588902229	2.847278855019939	0.358475867964493935	8363.8931657375033	24523.448993960996	8562.1135467668519	16242.803771254521	1.7376185102653252	3.3987169241214352	0.511257203544392756	10517.128701025727	11723.907928009972	10605.465350438972	8930.8462625469656	2.6176086574941371	2.3404360455695548	1.11842776582136027	3963.21505883502	4831.7532165080293	4299.0534122515419	4457.6240022396496	0.89924102261818339	0.95303868168034223	0.943551442248591678	3296.5673942978283	2344.5874925484541	3643.9926011805687	2419.3949311489505	0.87226954004879353	0.55985342447377151	1.55803198108268139	9138.4562445940628	5793.1478738793303	9311.0555215450695	5131.162303846947	1.9695919015295353	1.1179950288036284	1.76171794219622310	9266.1417990865466	16403.547267189209	9445.1521906112248	11753.48520079089	2.6060035870521463	3.1705270620943522	0.8219464890265596511	10701.660386711605	14733.275452067985	10780.146407605065	10775.844772726328	2.155871789426365	2.2798609175535134	0.9456154859392915712	7246.2681863655671	25530.609027588045	7492.8787271427836	16780.039395083029	1.8249053368714734	4.1722524510596211	0.4373909197196360613	4615.6382764516748	6596.3929752194126	4946.0346680479843	5663.1364994362912	1.3180512031969673	1.4646029383415133	0.8999375658016237614	4314.2438085136755	10541.871114341109	4653.7227449550528	8213.4383622065743	1.3417131812791465	2.1910691266997744	0.6123554774832947715	5556.1987607909132	5258.4856463169053	5880.6109657721254	4701.439905007167	1.320676709112075	1.1819957923643407	1.117327758392719316	5088.6904599382096	6249.6207745879074	5413.0132438366245	5451.6297618229619	1.405420115736679	1.2065973807313264	1.164779683911500617	3125.4290693943003	2837.8674128533439	3467.6874499674659	2873.7664119277015	0.79806134169413145	0.74955206509968186	1.064717687874021718	6403.2770507651067	6229.3039832432678	6694.6064527614271	5408.2944226764266	2.002793822845101	1.5516608463366408	1.290741999176915819	8509.2203184076061	6638.1536439553729	8710.8321687093958	5696.5019071200313	2.0079316275003554	1.2485178781805375	1.608252202544756320	7601.8838424188998	6577.6011557774746	7819.910784442447	5695.8663274948676	1.2590526082276461	1.0622720937754864	1.1852449251046124!sample_table_end
