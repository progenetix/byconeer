Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692813/suppl/GSM692813_JB0794_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692813/suppl/GSM692813_JB0794_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	1177.4269148335238	870.16471572282171	1149.8469699288626	873.61539583380682	1.2968729562141226	0.97077502382569691	1.33591504147203582	776.35393326378778	517.07916045097886	780.89610582361297	534.7430984757242	0.84151518645510881	0.60926447977627829	1.38119850145229693	2224.3518274507182	2765.4893933697222	2069.2412773256228	2536.9030408105978	2.2894893222699486	2.8689057763078405	0.798035732360797174	1543.6538973221425	1944.4282464785456	1476.9617229471128	1815.6012653358346	1.7609447295285758	1.9912984863558032	0.884319825277028795	1630.1236635874188	1989.8889618692501	1553.1117611137654	1854.3155642064555	1.7443023770614938	2.1748158358520766	0.802046016175934966	2052.770788274282	2092.9250971295269	1921.2353361606743	1944.6359785645423	2.2160929173680777	2.2588906079933229	0.981053668347727457	565.8530983556177	1164.0093729042892	579.78725961332452	1134.7924832730812	0.6456367164442518	1.2404504689610834	0.520485688545865978	736.52326262381894	672.29287392290871	743.34792989764946	690.63402605119734	0.8352937067221966	0.76880216849379157	1.08648718871159379	1312.4573053968204	1617.3919376602244	1270.6088662089016	1530.431865633986	1.500918969970898	1.8537125203802023	0.809682706174447610	2755.7124224926447	4212.357614864949	2532.7484407496459	3889.1926833584043	2.81739857748956	4.3788403200518005	0.6434120387053140511	1887.097240578712	2054.6513575244376	1777.4369324649717	1910.7156197933878	2.2060400810017735	2.3368991543666451	0.9440031149310174112	3723.385229671238	3630.6562069786301	3537.7835978468861	3335.9473882784432	4.2197165620869566	3.6842229473592023	1.145347776825392113	1047.7456381211505	1741.3407029978862	1029.7724543333973	1638.6756004143497	1.1267632779762986	1.8210942691726661	0.618728693538854414	1375.6626024911361	1677.132450718613	1327.6643288940083	1582.4827291760166	1.5638270723931786	1.665659247102151	0.9388637412567210115	956.72172617747754	1130.8092635468392	947.81027310815466	1105.7081802931507	1.0321833016171902	1.2471201515092925	0.8276534545352498616	1425.9203724592485	1661.178230003314	1372.0028950951371	1568.1607955865256	1.712914575581902	1.8508468534781677	0.9254761258949872917	433.08350738803711	1170.5073120196976	450.51725814964925	1140.217196751129	0.55574570007805768	1.5015044855464228	0.3701259006734252118	1312.3320872965119	1465.0525469808269	1271.2556492855717	1397.0239787152163	1.5785669395763422	1.6164143181071768	0.9765855955946035619	842.24135698308567	1425.6232038604667	841.72500813346028	1363.339839778441	0.94224470434617191	1.5180723277451429	0.6206849878791531620	1093.0404471186505	1171.1460631679774	1072.8651094684512	1140.9738674530333	1.1978361735840546	1.3801823861836864	0.86788252449458259!sample_table_end
