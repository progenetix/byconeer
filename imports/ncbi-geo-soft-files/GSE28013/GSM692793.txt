Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692793/suppl/GSM692793_JB0731_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692793/suppl/GSM692793_JB0731_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	1690.300450487438	2038.4446472909569	1694.6408048281401	2013.4195836189049	1.4213873203228327	1.6653681856131948	0.853497342270575612	216.92116584033843	369.06989920251522	302.90130901823773	282.38730551312449	0.26571590453141225	0.2563204057125924	1.03665529005659733	5874.3564180905105	4414.8188287023231	5641.4144410991757	4426.5022872617374	4.9435127022796417	4.0151645321060982	1.23121049280802194	3279.4289911337291	2272.0436500150163	3161.6300640215027	2249.6441273058549	1.9208456691520681	1.3531660257539193	1.41951958044606165	1318.4561515264788	1370.6565520540214	1352.3377999109109	1326.2411377522494	1.2174962792389949	1.2485869248581047	0.975099334295332916	4511.8062909822638	3276.716316861392	4317.2111446610952	3272.7158174568458	4.1423505281545427	3.1354550452615526	1.3211321700863357	2259.127876963752	1479.1606000143206	2217.7803612326647	1438.497488212583	1.6398077261422479	1.1378985843307465	1.44108424838818018	906.58296708318642	833.67603302353734	969.00134765150847	771.40259231664061	0.79478738233092938	0.64701127685777016	1.22839803687941659	2382.6632607860547	3110.689827414617	2333.637430718511	3103.9015628737361	2.0872512504778178	2.8401538393858723	0.7349078143348549710	4070.3484258818671	4938.3470100425748	3905.0899685948302	4957.1081907707858	2.7329497873176885	3.479662984895235	0.7854064601029090411	6987.0614196978277	7315.9297308005598	6745.028430342707	7287.9591524226389	4.8220596910043225	5.264474208052019	0.9159622595603139612	6507.0541875190465	5557.7889679947139	6271.1261900692571	5573.6923198619434	4.0866596066204721	3.5632788067620682	1.146881798546097513	3202.1139615511183	3668.9601575676229	3089.1082509652429	3674.0344725680338	2.3067285554567309	2.7250572468576451	0.8464881088706290914	3526.9651838394961	3702.1440458157099	3384.5492422438415	3710.3712199896067	2.1152864864077232	2.4123146786019078	0.8768700473329907915	4262.7704525403115	3956.8995091371994	4069.7098281119497	3970.8948064659889	3.3528622143548228	3.2612094425463489	1.028103920776370316	2643.7031751213563	2558.051374063697	2573.8012277132748	2543.0645046011828	2.3299139796193584	2.4590402037043391	0.9474891773259895817	1907.7948469305966	1680.3290740371185	1893.8844969708393	1647.118614849275	2.5076729383229894	2.5643305032481489	0.9779055137965277918	1980.0015267202803	1575.6083037375608	1967.0688155010052	1531.1294991922084	1.6629798540236618	1.3777075151990807	1.207063063587454419	3504.3026004228218	3691.4696723455236	3369.7907176751551	3699.326385109383	2.5721449115049486	2.8258614468550363	0.9102162154367282620	1250.8403826467681	1226.5812712121701	1287.2972386761053	1182.530503469326	1.1996499891448009	1.1230818286127355	1.0681768314483768!sample_table_end
