Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692809/suppl/GSM692809_JB0789_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692809/suppl/GSM692809_JB0789_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	1825.6929210343872	2088.7521504426882	1915.3977968210779	1960.0823430747582	1.1236542264298566	1.1748954434208609	0.956386572713390672	548.91205047573339	854.04715051431117	599.25186004944271	844.99434423366608	0.34638124551297711	0.51359313855864508	0.67442732292932553	4654.2873996308772	5624.396152156788	4772.0714466309255	5119.7597786006409	2.7085412587213233	3.0292665007084683	0.894124454909419394	1710.5408389387871	4054.08321007211	1791.2225133524078	3684.9791950803419	1.2028043092254015	2.3866757362349289	0.503966370866485	1699.0575931235499	3537.7363798686342	1781.4295470187899	3230.212848286722	1.0267175865018752	1.9208372308941393	0.534515663268325896	3287.4245906536012	3643.5910608554441	3423.4680848551607	3324.5872785510687	2.1258848421513408	2.0533376962471781	1.03533132715420087	1477.5184018833261	1921.3255608287996	1546.8457860456401	1815.0050805818739	0.85512670420259229	0.98967477596133069	0.864048195400308318	956.16962518776643	974.4922613549237	998.06624759562283	955.343458356616	0.59912226768349164	0.59085653861267906	1.01398940103162869	2752.9798866004107	3329.4349392829017	2878.5624136581368	3046.7763623032729	1.6784674974549281	1.8173083739193416	0.9236008162087654410	6773.1265352011897	7087.7678558142843	6902.3091352684605	6526.3941166661598	4.5765079651314267	4.1483363848582346	1.103215250777649611	3862.1151895070361	5802.6714322754633	3993.8348820876708	5286.8129012527843	2.4312070906468546	3.100839645657802	0.784047989727990512	4807.3884273107815	7817.8374961960044	4920.0704515998568	7256.9330386610736	3.1580695239616214	4.4553386710573664	0.7088281625989456513	3080.4229330597159	3728.1482169020387	3212.3247815661284	3398.7625774435783	1.9841633028379508	2.1539588349487868	0.9211704841541814614	2326.7997552425968	3421.2499340287009	2437.6168733163563	3126.1756475041898	1.5096576734300251	1.9478888823505911	0.7750224805473833215	2459.5783193835678	3171.7018098168446	2574.4425635265629	2903.7761236869451	1.4604945641115294	1.68854140071322	0.8649444801854629916	2996.8424214903971	3346.163681274038	3129.0140657506104	3063.0928912958989	1.7659953710899596	1.7538511807572688	1.006924299202767817	2200.0915425957132	2761.8007559948119	2302.673909150064	2544.2270738601269	1.3490979252770272	1.5300973546746763	0.8817072463757494918	2669.1776680830608	2873.4968675681448	2791.4485116081964	2643.2113943720665	1.7607644892151995	1.6334287237906691	1.077956119890572719	2272.3004850252028	3254.8405197108268	2379.7312538054039	2979.959598616671	1.4281221443971897	1.8096543633797892	0.7891684585171097120	2538.7474873711285	2606.8725599390145	2656.8646416993356	2408.1369939455863	1.4539166982117835	1.3178123540893698	1.1032805191877746!sample_table_end
