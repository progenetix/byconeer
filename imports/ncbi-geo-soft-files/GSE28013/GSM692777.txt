Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692777/suppl/GSM692777_JB0176_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692777/suppl/GSM692777_JB0176_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	7628.2775321814634	5876.5149523440805	6840.9200329184769	6436.1004521499781	2.2587217959736883	2.1469622620732935	1.05205472675261172	545.38362177620843	568.79517061859156	575.17664385154978	542.86896098184855	0.20123011312020625	0.19093620258857472	1.05391282738461413	27192.348139856935	16650.921347623225	22136.364502611228	18232.995801865218	9.3340847318521547	7.6227046156957403	1.22451087933179874	1663.3066407653853	1355.6724687841045	1587.7825564915868	1424.1380343154258	0.61216180241436891	0.55909850610293133	1.09490867124883455	6655.8899541975998	5606.9493805380052	5999.967804312776	6153.5892690185283	2.2590263023319301	2.3684148334464767	0.953813610027358876	8031.5884105987552	6188.4603181846842	7192.4122055441485	6782.9047665285852	3.0049860261149055	2.7906815250725292	1.07679289059571457	5186.0471246445686	4279.3197025582049	4719.6315197870881	4678.0956815511518	1.4620201580934844	1.484812056949425	0.984649977248456048	1015.3622780064832	803.01874231429042	1000.7974470281918	805.71533623006133	0.35573043427527762	0.30236173486755097	1.17650612909436019	5381.1116040850357	4652.8635608142386	4882.9671612838465	5112.3277829049839	1.867861277104639	2.0123264342738452	0.9282098795162242510	23008.361981633348	19038.365547286761	19383.456367418294	21146.172746984834	6.8429892237587779	7.2280984682680458	0.9467205315201595611	32198.425053066563	23779.203206377551	25332.826871878286	27050.442454453139	8.8474617284034256	9.5268858364121396	0.9286835048015458212	6343.9710587119362	4780.7685732479022	5709.3032694732401	5251.3617077271119	1.8625216562423608	1.6472416347031678	1.130691221617881313	7922.0675959271448	7722.8072175717407	7108.9705979246846	8473.6557988104905	2.7784403272190645	3.2671052126141387	0.8504287883021451914	5529.4663506550996	5507.0507142911483	5009.0173975794523	6035.5824846989226	1.6901274315088297	1.9630584238565747	0.8609664444873975615	8358.0663300395809	7585.0178829268289	7484.6656008406762	8318.7679164368237	2.7214577669600035	2.9492819496647149	0.9227526609551144316	6203.0532440015213	4891.8939432581346	5586.8983215017843	5371.7442958447837	1.9996584665113388	1.974305923928346	1.012841243231721817	5632.0588079256895	4651.0025933249317	5097.5702775154014	5107.6884173490625	2.2008329762761472	2.2600483127693543	0.9737990837812452418	10329.926201495802	7513.7878121472759	9268.9766869625109	8244.841774092085	3.9678980010806564	3.5087863788436326	1.130846273516465719	10414.030783664746	7712.8803362130202	9322.4151603864721	8458.2792969998573	3.1556673149354744	2.9439880198921573	1.071902227051545920	6312.2525387131527	3883.3083247996478	5681.0576056820055	4260.7820981793702	1.8925237106028181	1.4297811341192876	1.3236457423034678!sample_table_end
