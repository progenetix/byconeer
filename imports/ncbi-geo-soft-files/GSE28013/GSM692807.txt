Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692807/suppl/GSM692807_JB0787_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692807/suppl/GSM692807_JB0787_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	934.5035623620455	802.69520511864107	913.14202930405713	811.67742207713729	1.3244636478625118	1.2020512618545303	1.10183624433713662	344.71178846562367	351.11351520229312	347.70771533293419	355.22456362559757	0.51254744060959367	0.5495635959502756	0.932644455321543723	1402.6810094543998	1371.5092158622163	1347.1528943126571	1377.012564495647	2.1515506471040853	2.2513926352203746	0.955653231446892184	1431.4993852523764	1072.8808938533559	1373.6492503231148	1079.2330490051975	2.1172785697870005	1.5989662663758486	1.32415462058867415	996.97742182510922	1120.3563743701027	971.50499169557895	1127.2456499553389	1.4590743201274838	1.7540198994664753	0.831845933202521876	1764.8571590158476	1345.0822916397365	1675.9513966569223	1351.1500338631613	2.7827176017191211	2.3220961870383943	1.19836448518017827	601.6686424060415	655.39307292578565	594.81849668244877	665.30451682544776	0.85611051925427617	0.96461381495511034	0.88751633657052328	402.88089546303758	374.05797894302299	402.09806245669898	377.65247153929744	0.60198491898047257	0.56496746935686559	1.06552138243595869	1131.9296108422491	1385.5900187371212	1098.6081561552801	1391.2517305906961	1.6894383208705992	2.2096208521127676	0.7645829008425644210	2634.0587918435408	2587.226525853875	2472.0154845318557	2604.8653551124607	4.0301091781308314	4.327659852700859	0.9312444404833877311	1731.8028495909352	1874.1938826819683	1646.3828525336207	1878.1766745039729	2.6314881054399217	2.9871359247407367	0.8809401954711240112	3220.7960579100804	2502.3560589561653	3041.0804792105505	2515.5783386354383	4.7446639112108997	3.8111698663316487	1.244936352253898313	1263.5584921898364	1326.6192360930315	1219.7210724084239	1332.2039733150104	1.8170000051555362	2.0389130818801973	0.8911610903393574214	1222.3198336516245	1335.4158542959458	1182.1454399033453	1341.5176166001411	1.7756960708994656	1.9878633262916738	0.8932686907665816615	880.10807332301783	960.68425633511094	861.61886728645254	968.01478340815061	1.2935088324009698	1.522037464165098	0.8498534778909099316	1233.7135747399657	1138.9544836364707	1192.7048745716966	1145.6382060687699	1.816319308519462	1.802269415700581	1.007795667338348117	665.41308491712664	711.39860420983564	656.13950377558444	721.16993333206949	1.1590486712285997	1.3597394886916174	0.8524049502628414718	1138.1627982080147	936.76974952587318	1102.6820013075169	944.16485825437599	1.7956721399221682	1.5153473927337651	1.184990417730341419	911.18195137171847	1044.1725887170076	890.80917214633712	1051.1225265525966	1.2502820560237184	1.5156809750319842	0.8248979017483114620	957.15528430621407	798.16229192484604	934.35861448788137	806.94348622771452	1.4097570655243561	1.2652511915009712	1.1142112135472142!sample_table_end
