Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692789/suppl/GSM692789_JB0725_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692789/suppl/GSM692789_JB0725_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	538.40624947026504	620.17450333330601	529.60897604727745	635.86192853034834	0.78574359900704516	0.93797380508775019	0.83770313706525792	240.81423627740097	227.82715017098144	241.32666131071812	241.25544131346564	0.33324260122356658	0.34699148207870023	0.960376892329549043	2764.7845104033581	2313.4110477627241	2522.1539968233355	2322.4114045127567	4.1110323064526133	3.611689279222873	1.13825747140052564	1849.3678339261371	1406.4737304741402	1727.9399734634942	1427.0517258015718	2.446366005185225	2.05511042770283	1.19038177813137485	1341.8480657566424	1196.3134701264814	1267.2889345074323	1216.6855162963936	1.8160837060163069	1.7270142264034736	1.05157425934951416	2276.3804974602144	1968.0145744597321	2111.206769723844	1976.2866877895478	3.3939415657195813	3.2009926614879562	1.06027783398351647	1001.9362812722609	904.81525950983632	959.89580885768351	924.10633178990315	1.3988244671936261	1.3833899333824209	1.01115703782336168	1185.7490741672218	827.92457369853059	1125.9453512137861	845.77637981590988	1.4931763005650316	1.1736951963135998	1.27220108359893959	1171.5290756524312	1347.2728914944516	1113.4972912381434	1367.9086799368836	1.7386744262042408	2.1693903244595063	0.8014576291785682210	2495.6558754970079	2633.2859691058861	2309.5995101946332	2624.9353754918498	3.3756104473446444	3.8573018037098783	0.8751222017675792711	879.61011520525369	997.48329013153591	847.94506526402915	1017.4335175105583	1.4434196606660501	1.7113727968332035	0.8434279563967680412	2183.3484208142904	2299.3915317890455	2026.9667059918443	2300.7164577529948	2.9121433860816666	3.2741257959370547	0.8894415082326456713	1586.010809741799	1404.1738034194057	1490.0719838079253	1424.6608535768191	2.0199056671925857	1.9514809460946394	1.035062971654875614	902.39576305077833	909.71676021167013	868.37321171170049	929.52040123362713	1.2913375228809976	1.4025384665191456	0.9207145142235354515	797.02016979495136	730.09482233347615	772.65856935275053	747.18468083158621	1.1784985258291534	1.1340234661541395	1.03921881777794616	1206.2700847521426	1105.4687251897017	1145.0115179477536	1126.5550235188859	2.0615777785494758	2.0200470390075345	1.020559293293657817	629.741530863197	593.67796574669774	617.65454218688365	608.85590801812043	1.2824682153506559	1.2186957409601533	1.052328462508828718	1225.6564683567121	1159.6055479759627	1166.2124137672772	1177.835724719052	2.0997457429780928	2.1004937906095722	0.9996438705818492319	1576.605627181108	1316.4497420676987	1480.0235378269865	1337.9380832095133	1.6819040730467336	1.597252854292935	1.052998007501618520	1212.918872414205	1077.6666181774369	1150.823340002617	1098.705466938005	1.7085792425646564	1.6261896845501065	1.0506641745408338!sample_table_end
