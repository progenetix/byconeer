Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692797/suppl/GSM692797_JB0735_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692797/suppl/GSM692797_JB0735_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	341.28478829574084	328.45803145951106	333.28826089708895	334.11624990080384	1.211907255937358	1.2558052229266152	0.965043968453201512	78.700884284631741	103.28759341818279	86.160281666152073	99.110984924404079	0.36050215558282034	0.41160545971838258	0.87584395947875263	1288.2093342069036	1132.7060516442129	1277.8118364702154	1120.012802568114	5.3941294524153438	4.7085880128056576	1.1455938463389154	552.41616006634354	311.79129357190033	537.11537429459634	317.27342961120769	1.5907694469273244	0.95517769359229099	1.66541729104315755	397.02745373714822	420.49907410835368	387.19242439791191	427.16552444146146	1.7550407019691174	1.9893325452073571	0.882225903455564066	666.13399832873381	484.71290971082482	647.7453425150959	491.4981950308507	3.1513322156143935	2.420117504501917	1.30214016871175337	401.22329993957675	336.48638319175444	391.0969165189112	342.29125838429411	1.326340626214626	1.208430441459321	1.09757300106815848	184.21840789149527	172.95817949222547	184.38966586844271	173.25907493457558	0.69843444695625179	0.65497033988581266	1.06636042034822029	433.63870241621294	483.64157169494376	422.5058342820069	491.12821405588608	1.8439828422466842	2.2070306310148635	0.8355039646181808810	1637.0577626376821	1869.1202289238101	1637.3526699397587	1808.0633215157566	5.6969993803161874	6.3548858402516224	0.8964754872906756111	1455.6276345933263	1435.2511947251533	1432.4558583482051	1420.1424989706761	5.0793693989800435	5.0491602682515255	1.005983000959281812	1245.7620745308495	834.5287611957948	1212.9610841660933	840.83775536226699	3.6469443147047804	2.5542739123016056	1.42778121686197313	1014.1586937887196	1065.9506873440127	987.9308611190487	1065.8082539660077	3.4591616847709798	3.8226937129405214	0.9049016072255754414	696.36428479535584	745.87760995176438	676.73869788290381	752.83758287869796	2.0779230969096285	2.4835348237526782	0.8366796700558595315	663.95186890508307	690.40858500530726	645.34333122995167	697.42542259441325	2.6097476969922777	2.856339596585554	0.9136685638192145716	705.25751190033179	720.4053501841629	685.416902773218	727.21987146325546	3.0354184627251795	3.3581875869099149	0.9038859158902031717	340.4715453383987	316.29178987168171	332.08456246872225	322.07776700777623	2.4588075534671305	2.4802119750294342	0.9913699224994467818	560.54106823637528	470.23780117157162	546.2611340313174	475.55286978883464	2.2777146326880811	2.0561019614930078	1.107782919011541619	873.12583869772504	894.7527106915345	848.04585093320486	900.09837477149938	2.8526344773535048	3.0727340607560638	0.9283701163033929420	503.74371272591571	409.77974167007142	490.27516418988904	416.8751293487083	2.1893838061018496	1.8335639983701721	1.1940591154974465!sample_table_end
