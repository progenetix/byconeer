Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692796/suppl/GSM692796_JB0734_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692796/suppl/GSM692796_JB0734_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	399.12733334978026	270.44160250429314	315.06876855975781	334.36643459056103	1.2659440842286895	1.2320557318488614	1.02750553526419952	84.024861409485894	86.65387427309895	89.978851668337882	98.165343207404462	0.40373173802459644	0.41254733641269847	0.97863130455584083	1144.6842211940059	965.21831818718795	945.16125455137103	1061.5173988880804	3.9528939107890504	4.4181560720508974	0.894693135852515534	867.65709816733988	264.65930303468917	690.51004821302399	327.66061397980974	2.0735586334124876	1.0509003812226358	1.97312577905821375	367.67029526436443	280.60562949194622	291.37558881578997	343.52314815237673	1.2613011942664161	1.4799688342556347	0.852248483259987146	941.29119732916593	414.94261780972937	755.92304741950761	493.67803537759505	3.32347146816628	2.204913088282904	1.50730270767926937	456.1284650042582	269.82126750608728	356.96027879819383	331.86650660897237	1.1471498838400518	1.1515745818900243	0.996157697365366868	222.71930984181495	126.21467229359082	185.39687073336603	152.79056269738192	0.73620650983993063	0.60473062449803427	1.21741231552648739	532.26726239190327	416.581598960733	417.10026052953191	495.7394052246446	1.6010792826519264	2.0385663054723748	0.7853947543202063310	1495.4401717223261	1622.5155943556829	1265.4844494762781	1706.7163592939071	4.2189145831125092	6.0103543499700205	0.7019410732636011111	1495.0714001101278	1418.0255063926149	1255.0700966504176	1514.3305711897501	3.6994401788742484	5.0943424424886388	0.7261860035202174512	1292.7854719033169	660.50173458857341	1074.2010415240311	748.38927201373463	3.4878233814092225	2.3141864586296763	1.50714881612197513	789.1372403623684	846.06046342003299	626.20121855177604	940.0578579399504	2.3195137052070316	3.3178028009902643	0.6991113831463179314	685.08603286675043	626.14904436886923	539.91315383870756	712.77246749734343	1.7347189413593245	2.375495542852204	0.7302556077526822815	766.77664683453713	686.97685443825003	606.48777078244473	775.58881955879247	2.2557184806775172	2.8482416218035849	0.7919687934512854616	723.23329582525594	609.19034722436618	571.32424082915747	696.43501944688285	2.2107547791818165	2.9458258542606139	0.7504702886575432817	393.56990885825707	382.27322234204075	309.256832804738	458.94393897875364	1.6961407799275345	3.0786739570031885	0.5509322531764859818	629.68226700215632	389.96184783845649	496.4624487689149	462.37009974415133	2.0161053209048352	1.9570907294531938	1.030154244033504819	668.54246860554042	680.23341791326209	526.16964970752144	769.25587443038364	1.9057478286125005	2.7560169885620165	0.6914862413844722320	430.50025548411173	350.34865919341706	337.89975109195746	422.69848014425202	1.2893478368098759	1.7062520469409339	0.75566082931387091!sample_table_end
