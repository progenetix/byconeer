Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692787/suppl/GSM692787_JB0723_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692787/suppl/GSM692787_JB0723_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	538.14123962436213	520.5379533234867	522.64884888115796	536.73971868620322	1.0433559927759017	1.0693894635312298	0.975655762803793622	174.91897231320297	192.2677409430795	177.68883848663666	194.43155693763759	0.39486876137908639	0.43245016882578419	0.913096559659714923	2317.5144031672921	1758.9618619402659	2142.1179174255421	1839.3092918767895	4.44421890914463	3.8413807804069058	1.15693266645486474	1389.8802988162543	1091.7605968142216	1291.8029534338953	1142.1234982926005	1.9808646906161753	1.7316653226689562	1.14390735015882685	704.44969647168716	726.1250845078273	676.07387132674671	752.95533783327062	1.5437834648255726	1.6965203644468376	0.909970488523392466	1301.1244830494679	1220.7711679890235	1214.5095405430047	1279.0702200683199	3.0100483552626769	3.0504203712344871	0.986765097573921617	838.58423474066979	815.27207133205195	799.73173676751628	847.87602843417949	1.3817726699514579	1.4872659602147644	0.929068980878125288	595.51404950701681	508.48907982046558	575.29671614757638	523.87794162211776	1.2045786513778944	1.0964855475645061	1.09858142139080899	878.91091408775651	1035.9482610698103	835.15533762368352	1082.8501744746345	1.8438063689858344	2.3139710901283226	0.7968147816762848310	2388.2578224454583	2468.4342699466224	2210.0841601895186	2573.9972938099186	3.9454509461003213	4.7373511414545435	0.8328390335213614611	1293.2306039600687	1247.8502683637951	1206.4811677006717	1309.16868987425	1.9953646696441003	2.2848102883061787	0.873317439026127812	2505.7558640447601	1759.147644186346	2308.0617775540672	1855.8164487750571	3.5422082076679753	2.8442061818151188	1.245411893946241313	1573.6434733969606	1228.0774001121026	1455.5584943450951	1287.4172482609677	2.7472246389501587	2.426980548040599	1.131951651268118514	1099.3247418607332	935.32329378688564	1034.0833995675739	975.44676725826582	1.5384677710665819	1.5030161856113462	1.023586961866825215	768.22630456739842	695.44555250534438	734.95930492701495	720.84727357109534	1.535717137959296	1.4950629470071353	1.027192293831870916	1267.246294555634	1169.9783164962942	1183.526019770241	1225.6692426264842	2.4593388456806755	2.5121434539664604	0.9789802575953968617	559.81403685365262	643.51634500430634	543.18220731888505	665.79936021893275	1.6414721776924674	1.8523471153491566	0.8861579798357931418	1141.440815491196	1028.8227482193274	1071.796435796105	1074.6967277105498	2.0375533743532999	1.9836426952640978	1.027177615816554419	1157.1232248412666	1084.8126286731201	1086.3500417769606	1134.3276286919806	1.9433443900436098	2.0671500266249154	0.9401080545743234520	773.3545777314647	707.77796036725147	739.81110268520069	733.9371232354531	1.7546711597334677	1.6788739718387702	1.0451476341679664!sample_table_end
