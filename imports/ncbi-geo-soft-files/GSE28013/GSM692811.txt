Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692811/suppl/GSM692811_JB0792_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692811/suppl/GSM692811_JB0792_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	1032.3231597498907	976.63101644924222	1072.8886424962402	916.15978507403599	1.6039687028189977	1.3373513703437532	1.1993622157853052	429.26968586889762	431.74832636405506	453.85648832230345	417.59733123861372	0.66829787679465369	0.60984739607248584	1.09584443763898693	1969.0661804160638	2078.8539819092734	1995.6292822424139	1906.5296064809559	2.8032967751300406	2.7144664232741689	1.03272479301796844	821.02103623850837	1538.6163523020111	857.19092681240795	1419.8415258189207	1.2055695153020085	1.9682661574707934	0.612503299274908995	955.38354568168313	1560.75902510277	994.29569302603659	1437.6363906358561	1.4883600009635365	2.143227329221443	0.694448032026636856	1363.3651477660369	1936.9912483908352	1403.7198226409919	1776.2376330921616	2.1326576104114943	2.7072308635606688	0.787763481540147977	524.37311834575826	877.58174872927782	553.04083046219057	827.90579125944362	0.76813263641375917	1.1322173918053511	0.678432112042503648	426.53474279924603	449.09605041478136	451.43887879722331	435.25155795753682	0.67858665544696317	0.64642508097728879	1.04975298053264159	1316.8689850854651	1327.2480960177379	1357.4936269921095	1228.1565293602641	2.0410811512946663	1.8389838012106809	1.109896210043250810	2779.8194466757182	3198.7599572123854	2756.7165828083912	3024.1615463821736	3.8543434618221619	4.2993561504481521	0.8964931787333773111	2286.3254695965479	2552.8522092552198	2296.1235143939143	2359.4272955591691	3.224685369914575	3.319101966908188	0.9715535714374079512	2061.2819095252903	3774.4824646908996	2083.6415893519793	3666.0841318727485	2.9359649205622249	4.9801803665025037	0.5895298371741712913	1159.1995323430569	1338.3999890231287	1196.2585819930309	1242.2448603529651	2.2147585715331579	2.2232828442810653	0.9961659071989721314	1193.8708576861522	1527.621813313667	1234.6349657320723	1407.9920513547604	1.7689267230771495	1.8785456576187811	0.941646914943455215	948.33111532491887	1075.3898104150803	986.68598714013331	1004.1385226842699	1.4125792659471934	1.4228917233348417	0.9927524651254006116	1444.8004688337608	1518.3022251891975	1484.320957393151	1398.4251008884019	2.0802721766898764	1.9870618309859007	1.04690862873538717	816.19914679179374	955.59251364307124	852.50906836013985	897.45955659754645	1.2692323993333205	1.3826901902028013	0.9179441702317713318	1232.0803576656865	1399.8678514603939	1272.7480352327329	1293.525764345216	1.7795745301605514	1.760444423834244	1.010866634622092719	1051.1025270007613	1228.3771173649054	1090.6485701678241	1140.8128374314783	1.5248720060092849	1.5457520961488804	0.9864919541809991120	737.93038771597355	745.06501194493967	772.62237172557968	709.79272920046697	1.132217193553507	1.0487739809992149	1.0795626265201508!sample_table_end
