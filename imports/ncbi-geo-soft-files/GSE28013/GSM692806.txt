Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692806/suppl/GSM692806_JB0786_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692806/suppl/GSM692806_JB0786_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	1374.5004825151702	851.08645774710192	1258.0554888250515	912.55222569672117	1.2228801654012971	0.92555878895073462	1.32123445857785282	559.22746549222506	565.40986130932708	534.7984331658563	602.3390505723404	0.53729672907253401	0.64232010786495708	0.836493708500710033	2507.5993689615239	2257.3235681851347	2216.3090459188675	2398.636466540228	2.4550706348362583	2.7263093561751734	0.90051065895198194	1810.8590642316674	1081.0875148436332	1635.2101318286207	1157.4477006207348	1.9436913263419286	1.3110542629417326	1.48254071649230665	1339.5972395312006	1327.3855199794457	1227.7367039420003	1416.4684971293018	1.2498183340836695	1.5398770340493624	0.811635154267522756	2679.7441903948288	1513.0441791577696	2357.3041332094549	1610.6198439225977	2.6598926219158874	1.8982147193337324	1.4012601392373057	1011.6302482751003	1001.615247771033	939.5266023804171	1075.5536382483729	0.94619096427537919	1.1018746093416736	0.858710198287163338	579.61248056142779	532.69706450785134	555.312138770606	570.29484424522036	0.59957649596821738	0.62623316753771163	0.957433312460427959	1751.4566290778844	1964.1502428208025	1585.0502154073254	2087.3247302236982	1.727540646259901	2.3643230870023326	0.7306702944943989110	4548.6137884324708	4053.225400851542	3964.3431300186303	4341.2295991297442	4.7614406839479226	5.0975587622658676	0.9340629320830939911	2340.3427260069752	2416.5814791345024	2079.776761077439	2567.0024783778472	2.4421764202732441	2.9751881803645386	0.8208477152440212	5201.5662736295671	2810.5032090080635	4568.0218607687684	2993.9118391313386	5.4689341723431202	3.3083593230558996	1.653065353037746813	2174.5408035339374	2140.2932974028349	1941.4638119303247	2273.724725409018	2.1092050642671047	2.540836875674827	0.8301221870872429514	1793.1107192874122	1668.5489627282641	1621.1382474202721	1775.3254623814837	1.8154359576201755	1.9597826261090006	0.9263455719191598915	1363.9606337618866	1250.9166799395268	1249.1708801885879	1336.2579059850607	1.262399772193215	1.4501637177863971	0.8705222429093768516	2281.1748138356543	1827.4515673650267	2030.8653370028251	1943.1793122276272	2.0347951256646564	2.0272136925879756	1.003739829256481917	1292.4004610355869	1404.6597536756844	1186.0845777152604	1496.0020429806875	1.2531199715361327	1.7191633102875836	0.7289127007523847918	1737.8563091646754	1275.6011214319692	1572.934626322384	1361.6462675860596	1.7915664683760564	1.513706537423765	1.183562615396503319	1295.8854602432457	1543.8205958993351	1189.7720119154935	1643.4001838920688	1.2387380774129364	1.7446899275161092	0.71000471652662720	1642.8848667174748	1348.821343685657	1491.9935842924444	1437.6060567644231	1.5109897542947772	1.5242738276229784	0.991284982338825!sample_table_end
