Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692795/suppl/GSM692795_JB0733_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692795/suppl/GSM692795_JB0733_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	2901.7986460458856	3058.3787176525288	2949.3351767428135	2931.1514213529708	1.7097454926505677	1.7298868586751335	0.988356830434568792	294.46485651598414	430.74711696247186	388.0119760641918	349.00140758562611	0.26136046117370726	0.23689729503791052	1.10326486054592523	8061.0439197382957	6210.2141951936501	7890.0362521853558	6093.2403887384044	5.3359384369094611	4.1751216810033744	1.27803183825461994	5439.7990715395144	2522.3698287869743	5371.7084357024914	2400.65690944995	2.7228059731949736	1.1686920593213148	2.32978905904106795	2386.4147866077783	1853.254613452694	2454.7212496165657	1742.0627509099691	1.6580289243917496	1.2452404498923517	1.33149298557967876	8049.3526003649122	3761.9851948121714	7854.2988128972966	3631.0428109363506	5.8104598544117065	2.7476331348670859	2.11471458131646897	3183.6991205686081	1872.7886531076506	3221.0377154212742	1759.6678761015523	1.6982304727115762	0.93060899031937017	1.82485930221754128	1411.5072862127954	1142.5840750611878	1508.9137828480568	1044.4873066242567	0.93077421736884625	0.6290786896381706	1.47958313117267229	3723.1473116750244	3836.2398965707634	3741.3095320203374	3709.2890435107402	2.4524539732466009	2.5068873348505973	0.978286474686250310	7978.8665420028046	7624.735310625113	7778.6060715418671	7540.8852697531756	4.3836163624208826	4.1380862953657038	1.059334206570354211	9629.2110094508516	9995.0630770511925	9323.246463678126	9943.0224395122968	5.1081982318897827	5.3741000919679802	0.9505216025887550712	11255.272947739146	7466.3439039432487	10894.050666993257	7386.6824333071236	5.3857231394778999	3.6256054747796567	1.485468613985148113	5569.0505617939862	5993.8898944618741	5498.29381481158	5889.8787809699616	3.1269024422081682	3.2924430479836939	0.9497210419852505414	5455.0124654110832	5723.5967845828854	5385.9778717448698	5611.5590003300767	2.8334361453461363	2.8459274108077355	0.9956108278046159615	5263.8700751028418	5134.3983215407143	5205.7519417178655	5014.0931109517578	3.2417337649243758	2.9830910262076658	1.086702932107813416	4128.8033166637879	3773.3626286806857	4127.4173336615231	3642.032257139173	2.7599442258746474	2.5771945194234216	1.070910327130492117	2699.2932624047799	2023.0663706574881	2754.5212483454175	1909.1384732752097	2.9656259631169157	2.4723572987666831	1.199513502597822518	3690.3856330615331	2552.8818234899782	3718.7988341909677	2424.9252422550403	2.5355748887838141	1.7281911829061793	1.467184252450538319	5654.9236307013434	5746.2821664256126	5576.5567744018981	5634.4515482806082	2.9195541080941356	2.9995116966197539	0.9733431316118134120	2753.7917884672697	2404.6557221440175	2810.8600814309043	2284.0743670647075	1.756640035668231	1.4590716293946131	1.2039436586105663!sample_table_end
