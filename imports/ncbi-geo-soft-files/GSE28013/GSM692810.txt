Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692810/suppl/GSM692810_JB0791_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692810/suppl/GSM692810_JB0791_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	2359.4803987775945	1583.2941400213983	2442.4782879545819	1525.013111144161	1.7079489086462087	1.0986950696396487	1.55452495951072582	734.2264079101094	591.69930172614454	755.91755054347777	606.57641580496295	0.55215473427538586	0.46169765516972378	1.19592276047494633	4748.1500282849247	5061.0271824836755	4865.7675110621067	4594.9603966229379	3.3742407547107462	3.1926615122513087	1.05687394099332414	2501.7640177323583	2897.9214453107179	2589.2013615809783	2681.4007003949509	1.7821219435132376	1.8278126063709814	0.975002545283643385	2341.255072904617	2969.2188587001829	2425.6674077749612	2742.5479220783786	1.6423482851604099	1.9717270095159312	0.832949123907175356	3669.6844732511695	3707.9561707628509	3791.1742186931724	3393.8781911360779	2.8061710962386996	2.4455894283304858	1.14744162030270567	1348.3945659061299	1959.6609524796675	1389.3217457271849	1858.5462272764678	0.84975027484164911	1.1605467301354422	0.732198241377560518	963.64567683126154	728.76439303481641	991.93833686913831	729.08334514033459	0.74085683384087442	0.54609681581575076	1.35664009088607149	2768.276209560865	3263.8996397018873	2868.6600082680402	3003.5347184780817	1.945377486076578	2.0208196305890289	0.9626675516357384710	6939.1450705416892	8190.3220168135258	6988.260054990963	7600.6706368230953	4.9628173388852135	5.4866572820507074	0.9045247559239383311	5681.5876838827116	6594.4999746373369	5767.4320268911106	6019.0825388959247	3.6798439131489507	3.8772137703752176	0.9490949251407495612	7236.4637915135881	7165.9315695080131	7292.8225368666017	6578.6367552385782	4.9035239620321303	4.2679640727898898	1.148914067317062813	3641.4606363199632	4670.726084445133	3761.6217403056453	4247.3220633167184	2.6991696696089966	3.1011475723322199	0.8703776929838539214	2894.2809849151454	3848.7921612603914	2995.4522678622925	3520.3033454040283	2.0336585114367378	2.3820913543426729	0.8537281778590376515	2830.8434478309673	3103.1352344816119	2931.0301749546652	2861.8287365834544	2.0871391529191872	2.0694187469112983	1.008562987087237716	3765.4099276261559	3929.9682764289178	3881.356930763186	3592.2111068195914	2.3334851206605247	2.2579424896855591	1.033456401710871617	2132.7385412235735	3384.0959945070886	2208.1064417644548	3107.49647803982	1.4799718706416989	2.017553438349097	0.7335477923463157318	3297.1726063948231	2731.8201592680757	3408.787722477919	2536.8377184112246	2.3744192835222275	1.7770009621302847	1.336194709020164519	2635.7931879832427	3077.2717323956904	2730.0502132540037	2835.9195560093485	1.9691168767792644	2.118262136592274	0.9295907445841690220	2373.1509385159275	2014.4395247822611	2457.4837251697932	1908.0709334599358	1.7108810574154196	1.345844586093899	1.2712322619515681!sample_table_end
