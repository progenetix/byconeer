Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692788/suppl/GSM692788_JB0724_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692788/suppl/GSM692788_JB0724_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	685.07254946914668	754.75628801983657	699.85616075462724	740.14719187934077	0.97202222761795676	1.0295165830899164	0.944154026835196562	220.58785039777288	273.95907589384001	233.75776414821041	266.40699379532037	0.3485008325035332	0.39859268413852872	0.874328221193376393	3082.5946574935588	2660.4855266549635	3049.6888338855779	2611.2911809915613	4.3552987158972654	3.7725587800171962	1.15446808647933494	1624.9841307481272	1201.212942961879	1611.1072157973604	1183.2299145832844	1.8226699378936975	1.3630402192298665	1.33720921230301415	1142.9005505255923	1374.0747824688667	1147.7119950942376	1355.4080009678687	1.8714749077601309	2.1110803322958627	0.886501038889811586	1989.2693059895701	1783.1248162177949	1970.3626777315708	1761.0232942559051	3.2147412586784307	2.831664502514903	1.13528324270876857	1086.892189861316	1153.8139957989595	1093.4016055136362	1136.3707837651193	1.448502867009658	1.4964724586390912	0.967944888425773538	878.59612066664897	801.03291188946525	890.47143711627268	785.90939084269814	1.2777363673212312	1.1236352880118579	1.13714510478042869	1172.3574855827956	1261.2303743123239	1176.1068755759304	1242.4810817776488	1.7420331897364645	1.8525589250855177	0.9403388826922461910	2679.4582463647307	3123.7434440054144	2654.3171941993405	3055.8248359092609	3.7344894790151457	4.1127366811826152	0.9080302894425262811	1440.0419266748543	1684.5674154681326	1434.4587592326948	1663.3868524829993	1.842031776281164	2.2380680521054623	0.8230454719856584712	2256.7811611560064	2298.2414862167543	2219.357419755002	2270.1345358428343	2.6313067809458737	2.6935611900144694	0.9768876945140937413	1949.1190797379488	1964.6220474152126	1921.8270094132668	1941.1648138024773	2.6062537144757605	2.6190801123967282	0.9951027088250348214	1345.7420135864311	1401.7038448997223	1343.8514577221924	1382.6904609129824	1.4978575009433039	1.5911504738597086	0.9413675988229444115	1055.2698222907111	1114.095172855298	1062.643593499685	1096.6934260887906	1.5042927853778985	1.5688209600810064	0.9588683627099320316	1465.5198079227948	1473.7502781866785	1458.2902893038097	1454.3289583526782	2.1671299094772434	2.2125774025912595	0.9794594787686113917	850.47076557766297	992.07871337833876	863.17987341096421	974.85402389560704	1.6675044022293146	1.8894080105338991	0.8825538967404504818	1521.8610768817787	1542.5278890064587	1512.9610268230699	1522.1240265710533	2.1162514329210005	2.1791986521501636	0.9711145107551099119	1607.9309614442686	1648.656406447192	1595.2529134038498	1628.4551008764417	2.0571659483411713	2.1033561400707503	0.9780397666141192920	1077.625427692202	1091.8737125398579	1084.3686417230513	1074.5956506495368	1.7458750036138013	1.6965747906732602	1.0290586735177039!sample_table_end
