Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692804/suppl/GSM692804_JB0784_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692804/suppl/GSM692804_JB0784_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	805.42924436473209	891.78765397356335	832.89583832183246	843.82636835471283	1.5961385205578587	1.6307762256052756	0.97875998895276952	187.95345159946964	225.39182304587112	208.9876465224234	214.37313122143425	0.36858893828956119	0.39746639812894796	0.927346160643199643	1422.7662152526939	1691.8835019247215	1452.5145654624523	1566.8492171937883	2.5946071970877589	2.8807026242284968	0.900685539446349774	1269.3712313202725	1049.1667774128059	1300.5880717469192	987.36042761995714	2.1185812416694567	1.626769599246227	1.30232409226919015	1280.1939430726552	1217.3417216874673	1309.3196134951033	1140.0256952393611	2.1936767370545649	2.0674115408801033	1.06107405017227976	1735.7954727191095	1287.7362102688448	1767.8000455009671	1203.545849485899	3.3188690563252075	2.3124783255533661	1.43520007069948057	440.66872931309797	422.53660315007681	465.26292789120635	403.9540643511437	0.88360594174499585	0.74794784786092539	1.18137373383992268	333.19829392577333	331.77445187310735	354.31634484319665	316.20558837112344	0.61395087075209964	0.57472034031995767	1.06826020880051269	867.85227372197585	1371.4815108948139	895.67424864266741	1279.0365230836587	1.6890723057594437	2.3875651281717691	0.7074455418323258910	2123.7996021459035	2255.6638968352468	2173.2305968062892	2071.2909092192867	3.8853918701367012	3.711463064634128	1.046862599054240611	2107.8236067067937	3153.599026830922	2151.5889137455847	2881.7716372148279	3.8069972422521969	5.0549460806508026	0.7531232146717700112	3133.4257840900682	2461.0412647990606	3294.0589533264433	2256.8675551007268	5.7766819163704808	3.8109193243622257	1.515823722491746813	1391.2756498761851	1771.283417153641	1420.7012796616191	1637.1729119836168	2.5249058564864795	3.0341089364746785	0.8321737648023143114	1522.693601619402	1755.9637943858531	1552.3619183728056	1623.3306575541781	2.6964715219705564	2.834889456395786	0.9511734279045890315	997.42518158243433	1196.427322177919	1026.0001393061214	1120.9832159583316	1.6964684319181673	1.9772706586748636	0.8579849321463731716	929.42959461879695	1110.6162092436653	957.9832136280545	1043.6546494691106	1.7814401751228439	1.9569638124450248	0.9103081844406317	707.88140482598067	913.89982850133413	733.8197181977514	864.30220216768407	1.3456500796247686	1.6322883213230799	0.8243948462083148218	845.64526485187673	993.30554533992222	873.36881984675097	936.83272063266645	1.5863766582017529	1.7393579970860311	0.9120472386129997419	975.5571775567895	1311.0429665501063	1004.3109092813622	1224.5020783177092	1.6378139936802836	2.120584862982819	0.7723406982055558420	560.0510134371043	633.55803417558218	585.55229408418575	603.69293412835793	1.0877697034266498	1.1350015052640814	0.95838613286557539!sample_table_end
