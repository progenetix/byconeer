Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692812/suppl/GSM692812_JB0793_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692812/suppl/GSM692812_JB0793_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	1201.4003333060243	1026.227942379089	1238.9154445299278	991.96979140617725	1.2619793472273571	1.039032684413425	1.21457136638564412	548.68962330588761	501.66155343668765	576.39031359284593	487.05823669224208	0.59497760975954461	0.50855826774831092	1.16993006994825493	2299.3493549160271	3005.813409423371	2342.0450137141565	2732.5765273849565	2.3181561630348422	2.6907743661301833	0.861520085895855714	1917.6473720373838	2191.9410544320895	1962.6166210000192	2018.4886603824029	2.0467163726650801	1.9464919504396838	1.05148976968682425	1464.256425455419	2088.5364067456294	1505.8333080307639	1927.0210604554575	1.491350248353996	1.9806641278844355	0.75295464150548336	2102.6491344570563	2356.9520143395544	2146.7088466021387	2161.7103765722673	2.2086093083438905	2.2972719594616247	0.961405243836035547	794.90502493534143	1383.531515418915	824.02302305153364	1310.6129317415346	0.7710357055185062	1.2076385489615904	0.63846562879389298	746.56652298698248	609.23898097847268	774.95999451698572	597.89204197658069	0.77665049637988626	0.5975123906348293	1.29980651205363469	1704.7997534212791	2092.6459443655003	1749.4746431750682	1930.7334420100824	1.6948798486827801	1.9364132506847436	0.8752676362256074410	4001.0038281507955	4838.7590377008419	4064.9688222837108	4398.9023671183368	4.0610618695630496	4.3714495013944843	0.9289966333289629811	2515.7246173588724	3415.2547390503319	2556.7663860153843	3090.2747201599577	2.4558105877632297	3.0695101265200475	0.8000659670562549912	4235.8377280874547	5759.5519724995065	4324.2944389437007	5247.4906305697623	4.26560950306627	4.9237541512183736	0.8663327558730267213	1680.0740010768341	2259.0318008244608	1723.2387649851153	2075.8985616408372	1.8637660908558491	2.1454913364521842	0.8686896372827120914	1407.6832987117159	2092.2851089659071	1448.9091490176199	1930.1123364186597	1.4767775621651815	1.8569420192712107	0.7952739217699261715	1273.7389383136237	1483.9587718705493	1312.4457812612645	1398.5116235963142	1.2852237844901142	1.4159915685666054	0.9076493201093942516	1825.1965133195697	1918.2442147770705	1870.3958780300009	1777.2182785373395	1.7845530471197777	1.7519341888640709	1.018618769165556617	1038.4416959207417	1585.525037510517	1073.1713349598015	1486.6301125086491	1.0355880191843083	1.5422094647330988	0.6714963452539383118	1894.6863429322495	1824.6356624049404	1939.6367549255949	1695.8668848438331	1.928629363580145	1.6538383262000582	1.166153506680100119	1487.0064062425288	1681.3945924344741	1529.7436678964486	1570.5185627221554	1.4273535108842996	1.4848040542786018	0.9613076599375162120	1223.7540513663143	1180.7015671505076	1261.0016818803256	1131.4577893583196	1.1925750978487406	1.1354078194496222	1.0503495549527124!sample_table_end
