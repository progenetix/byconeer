Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692814/suppl/GSM692814_JB0795_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692814/suppl/GSM692814_JB0795_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	1622.1515222643909	1257.4928277489121	1724.9543097584633	1175.4226043239646	1.2883193812052864	0.90460596859845765	1.42417740533077792	767.32180032564429	892.87134521471239	824.78240521859971	840.69603406758881	0.687230947094426	0.71311778490662303	0.963699071373480323	3436.0860200148759	3734.7294486391684	3550.8054286467714	3402.4438645932828	3.1203913978076239	2.9719988139153743	1.04993022984984124	1598.859387653127	2989.4313503249659	1702.0615314050322	2716.1597787357919	1.4778503838025911	2.194582310272573	0.673408500963920695	1535.7207354538562	2813.268484651277	1636.4043327074185	2560.4988266839177	1.3510193402647943	2.2069237870057794	0.612173083737420526	2893.3968476282898	3007.6163590372234	3016.0113651253314	2732.604541900118	2.7701719178209268	2.5501421474753831	1.08628137477096017	1298.0392910418723	2208.8915916860878	1386.3642738492986	2019.2559110119889	1.0087338825355225	1.4554680526396737	0.693064942721385868	868.60246575096016	1042.998548311996	933.59126966276858	979.02620913538829	0.78826241768226013	0.82385691099504244	0.956795296807316019	2363.326737405599	2476.1299177771457	2484.7189748874753	2259.1875988998918	2.0893865451814597	2.0000804582703609	1.044651247174491110	6024.5887816815757	6382.0737546413256	6055.5830449665664	6040.8774295477424	5.5718922319134423	5.2702373431199234	1.057237439066632811	3104.5652701821018	3624.5623233772162	3225.2703914445206	3288.0418851526083	2.6237848419494596	2.5873120597664947	1.014096785134707412	4256.2493940480599	5738.6830694854152	4350.4594423740973	5397.0673514708033	3.9705323737552951	4.5314892854247715	0.876209149721757913	2430.6635468857521	3082.3877133556362	2554.4869616453348	2799.6692792418439	2.2508660247374213	2.3915056287088587	0.9411920246880758314	1784.4832302274629	2601.7260237958271	1895.1146580221173	2369.2404725089878	1.451654792834953	1.7172605827354612	0.8453316913165157515	1485.7439655930104	1597.0812736683692	1584.2838196042674	1478.9882410034268	1.2826079581479384	1.2566927618329158	1.020621743915533216	2836.1780487006604	2933.61416611191	2959.5778078983208	2666.7832356308313	2.3062533606183369	2.0694053972532007	1.114452182099995517	1291.0778556470584	1604.4175823704586	1379.333174444497	1485.949211568789	1.3037457955151084	1.4590046794182021	0.893585753292439518	2094.4121998221244	2267.9479581762989	2213.1822782216168	2072.7460088306275	1.8516484921465874	1.6764446975707692	1.104509140581669619	2082.3856249448445	2196.7442897795163	2200.7368349300086	2009.3127439996319	1.7777676592114564	1.5866174714580936	1.120476542829001120	1818.6647666902361	1882.6515567658182	1928.4959599280385	1731.4923554089576	1.5480105843412328	1.432792532220772	1.0804150283655356!sample_table_end
