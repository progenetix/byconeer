Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692780/suppl/GSM692780_JB0179_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692780/suppl/GSM692780_JB0179_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	8322.659772270641	6297.1344763131656	7284.7053825218018	6945.0531112862673	2.8829518669428573	2.7454105665872843	1.05009862715234832	269.89572409148496	455.28604460045352	341.04211621899066	380.78639286631631	0.156295940235189	0.17369246675770625	0.899842941681606723	28075.208403285185	14314.847053237916	21518.48565468024	16123.219216615998	10.944055114999951	8.2156767374852162	1.33209417369918074	1584.4840624153335	1264.0796963082278	1526.3185993539787	1306.2532121125814	0.65150433958285381	0.55193486697190186	1.18040076568676145	5354.8362469417198	5119.7454685901512	4822.7983983361837	5679.7479844722602	2.2717277627413028	2.6807752018749151	0.847414494565778116	6269.2963126815803	4599.8893779246764	5579.7100398676639	5106.4306180919921	2.5418692766942175	2.388288767320212	1.0643056700159137	2486.3786499906328	2157.872828753952	2328.1754271646787	2314.8805040185275	0.90812806602330653	0.94002072748783361	0.966072384861386258	885.02466746319612	785.99644488550905	898.29925055006572	766.44904383481162	0.39727333504820689	0.33925383076300142	1.17102092599725779	4345.1159333537435	3415.7365035898315	3954.5075931502929	3740.1822167972446	1.8166062528172719	1.7235247238322662	1.054006494770808110	10298.576359971919	8802.1497751599363	9047.0862265475025	9740.3626819040401	3.8978683702822798	4.1557748737734439	0.9379402129988370111	33353.292168609194	25809.010476987562	24633.407885955956	30288.825733899386	9.6950548423325742	12.066888304856905	0.8034428261369032112	5558.3979212180539	3396.0392762503493	5002.8899059052301	3713.1158880222974	2.0052059707527801	1.4942658185933302	1.341933908814455713	7915.1563321778958	7141.6506513176764	6925.9909146895825	7880.6794145951781	3.0903059630628009	3.5240416680185644	0.8769209487810520914	6952.9779908172759	6304.1092000943518	6116.2267873510855	6948.4334820912363	2.4966261832007635	2.8375184152282626	0.8798625481343083115	8391.1199302438927	6590.4142585633772	7375.1560844014421	7275.7819168128017	3.0873507731808956	3.1546968688655692	0.9786521182591810816	4012.6349895652525	3480.7120428247367	3664.5225147511301	3820.2720477028302	1.4911647372437578	1.5575242292014311	0.9573942474129618617	4880.002671104543	3436.7439610168117	4420.4813334047249	3760.641621338616	2.2268493720686502	2.0511756610083491	1.085645376161464618	8616.9312258204627	6531.4315327344402	7598.8569000276548	7229.78022309465	3.4634046420335518	3.2924154457132904	1.051934271096586219	8134.3664686273005	6152.7846429594347	7136.0950216846977	6785.5655337688631	3.0376148556323912	2.8486720790243756	1.066326615126836520	4105.686284206673	2753.525871413322	3746.5782548367956	2989.0073859924933	1.5925575428920451	1.2804267488395107	1.2437709102339731!sample_table_end
