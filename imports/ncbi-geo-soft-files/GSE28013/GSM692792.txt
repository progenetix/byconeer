Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692792/suppl/GSM692792_JB0728_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692792/suppl/GSM692792_JB0728_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	507.69254260982359	537.19702854729326	512.66480768978442	525.12901750345179	0.90456806154782854	0.96901976354128228	0.933487732223422182	310.60023751583924	337.05275872170722	330.46220201409136	343.77463927752666	0.6363890343639178	0.64877590772036198	0.980907316056219283	2189.1217355054655	2122.3575218893179	2191.6343864658365	1979.9976746870559	4.3646409181878552	3.8912495476012401	1.12165536154792174	665.30344158381206	819.64647256231149	674.27016373733284	781.34111001576082	1.2063303025338343	1.326264230752793	0.909570110210328525	868.01617879612866	1035.7195514144366	883.01641632145856	979.39566287261027	1.7809237115607763	1.9572208021466637	0.909924781919073116	812.68215371680435	1011.7883530780755	828.59278941596335	958.37511567760657	1.7579863347453806	2.0308053337099894	0.865659699412839497	1095.1336895939055	1063.3645117517221	1120.2697166799751	1004.4251316994935	1.9599709844731923	1.7736081483638937	1.10507554122437568	598.60922847959637	702.99243561067181	606.00016570741434	674.71786406276397	1.1707076792416498	1.30053417277969	0.900174485026751689	580.51743950237869	695.88531842237478	585.9202030617256	668.3572595300551	1.1887275273222941	1.3548549659184153	0.8773835998870118710	1630.9265648164385	2032.1902804719005	1665.5204445678646	1897.5524949638987	3.3209953027822641	3.5971864156333515	0.9232202391150032811	810.21199655668602	895.14231278258228	827.40842395441689	848.50363125381716	1.6268110483705795	1.6294337720469168	0.9983904079310675912	955.53726238005095	1270.8814014071479	976.89648858336182	1193.926839206945	1.8193723035152398	2.045140033055163	0.8896076914583412913	1670.0743123235786	1384.8915900257969	1699.3387437900481	1300.4829573967916	3.0209476810771858	2.3201368238970899	1.302055831346614	1030.6525268998635	1137.7592878279797	1053.4585215223544	1074.5304488196089	1.7599525864369441	1.8540409695421256	0.9492522632181006315	748.8065956735378	705.92108402948224	761.29902416232017	677.26489382468094	1.5035369617280576	1.3081172900346956	1.149390022731202416	1293.160408676207	1298.2901562391166	1323.767912774656	1221.5963090929758	2.5448045718197232	2.4695208230984882	1.03048516457811317	691.14125330437093	659.85854456259801	701.50532999106326	635.01171097329188	1.7665457782549228	1.6716312680079344	1.056779573380496118	809.7503209294199	892.89551544204858	824.6091805332037	849.30106391571667	1.554363162924602	1.6535639556149062	0.9400078888068078619	1211.3678354194658	1091.8259411263875	1241.5037573468881	1029.9983546420847	2.3337819397388126	1.9198038025796695	1.215635648081785420	997.20367951288574	980.54734283447419	1019.0797493352612	927.55266263495923	2.1900932565479114	1.9700207932688867	1.1117107311917529!sample_table_end
