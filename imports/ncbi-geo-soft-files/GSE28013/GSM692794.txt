Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692794/suppl/GSM692794_JB0732_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692794/suppl/GSM692794_JB0732_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	907.92201498717498	883.21777259750024	927.1559014002712	837.37265101641276	1.6129212575580909	1.4737457729850298	1.09443656234627572	113.56856878453345	235.00880439428607	173.38077025066741	171.69260538659418	0.321718581518188	0.34309756132587788	0.937688336445551383	3530.6400931563953	2731.4117445484285	3438.7789724208419	2717.3085099515583	5.786290879318452	4.9573051466803966	1.16722507655054794	1660.1907276301474	1147.572038664091	1631.1220633658702	1114.9569183781564	1.9004112156367028	1.3251062821043549	1.43415757762368015	574.05044174389866	662.20163025281568	618.58563396707848	607.09719564069758	1.1819431843259594	1.2255630330792033	0.964408318808662186	1479.3511941271781	1020.3553605296312	1460.9453546262232	986.14060645790164	3.1337321045443214	2.208039944808331	1.41923705316678317	851.15726660310122	751.22352024997986	877.54142876086155	703.14497384234312	1.3361722460711802	1.0832317998686372	1.23350537367276068	317.0109800481618	408.47082613460589	374.81282510282904	341.09318320975279	0.65386275761482615	0.61668802168767523	1.06028126803146869	869.31287402738451	975.48431830239281	890.29439240314184	940.05124620906849	2.0044660562082557	2.1539681211091142	0.9305922574082122810	2431.2152216726704	2897.8560464391676	2355.9216759804449	2899.476231688895	3.6327698933324957	4.3654963140528009	0.8321550705788909311	3950.5088281316785	4731.9027266205812	3848.3213261020201	4677.9953015848369	5.3733669012559	6.3277354667021486	0.8491769179561420312	3676.9026747973494	2747.6042960307009	3557.3041983585549	2756.685363493762	4.5101373817696233	3.4037562220698758	1.325047120744428513	1888.5988663785138	2362.1262144620018	1840.7758670266767	2360.1274696359878	2.8053468743763297	3.5731325952561916	0.7851225219295808714	1909.4707523545019	2045.2670134024499	1857.1186260304748	2042.6876089230348	2.4354147860396735	2.6677305647371043	0.9129163260457212615	1720.0975414777888	1727.8704454516517	1681.0066740965826	1715.5586156911984	2.7951326437244872	2.8362650230240249	0.9854976953967148316	1433.2154409466489	1445.19159116325	1414.6723314879512	1424.6771576196991	2.6811342388122683	2.9402264392903765	0.9118801882005251917	969.67774658790813	880.77214945251455	983.06682102008801	841.75320455041742	2.6576320444390338	2.7645426967796989	0.9613279069752835918	1184.8168967580116	1051.2890579443451	1191.9568080257443	1006.8446892240136	2.0802142502786132	1.8808448490115592	1.10599991879810219	1836.4578394758348	1883.3219306428146	1795.9847946171715	1874.4567470743004	2.6341624120091098	2.9125563927254383	0.904415934602447420	770.31583873985142	741.55856146926737	798.83675203069015	692.97492113730402	1.4996665879394926	1.3719407439536095	1.0930986593617791!sample_table_end
