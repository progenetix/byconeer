Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692782/suppl/GSM692782_JB0716_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692782/suppl/GSM692782_JB0716_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	3424.3682297299797	4355.2811041053546	3800.3280626157775	3951.9260300441929	1.0014621108263346	0.96508319294667089	1.0376951107899712	1096.8799150445623	1246.7426393961819	1349.5124656134537	1133.1871958289817	0.37618695840900435	0.32863625906423255	1.14469097074123523	23204.473505628583	13894.92097412351	20461.391379119919	14136.693120698706	5.8397626595802903	4.2112114648634789	1.38671798087195014	7262.0315036179873	7775.1618290628039	7277.2582806106493	7493.3128450025142	1.5037013756195252	1.5434955707857936	0.974218134525640885	9460.3173659989425	7654.4448301325965	9224.17579633073	7361.3183684004789	2.7538429317724913	2.3005185739470293	1.19705311791840396	8088.1971053782099	10342.225010355305	7998.6047556062967	10259.944236177038	2.6359924692093188	3.3620503874045764	0.78404311817713197	9554.9301671218727	8710.8854654366678	9210.8384128560338	8512.7207543700461	1.9808838186088105	1.7545928607525589	1.12897063638979698	3664.2371079903851	3771.2810738011776	4026.5761234226065	3388.7592405989503	1.0787814695067066	0.94615365352669545	1.14017576900501749	6807.3820221281203	8178.5809970569644	6888.1284425220692	7916.7558340630958	1.904974489504949	2.2682294488785457	0.8398508759538428910	26646.467088356811	20039.494342632504	23392.168919774253	21007.655594199401	5.6140501582510751	4.8602788324227379	1.155088082765942711	12500.779723557245	10367.675021398147	11656.97622210316	10329.574600727958	2.5703184992852117	2.149171084743537	1.195958068453136112	13754.753625396534	18273.66633682845	12697.668702812172	19104.858696763458	2.5217808206226366	3.5551643058407034	0.7093289096314501213	13862.504451298835	9673.186518163533	12889.598400604433	9566.8885741601171	3.1859276943836732	2.2871849072141632	1.39294714840707714	8528.8702714863484	7385.3298545025682	8352.889822244766	7069.6645158057572	1.6426921639541801	1.3982013533698143	1.174860945453326115	6803.649691902664	5396.8275514956695	6882.6700991648404	4998.0698121531641	1.8809911635718894	1.402963248082215	1.34072732563958216	12245.070791015543	9227.7155538706611	11468.549139980521	9066.7599540189276	3.0889252573612751	2.4600412291552827	1.255639629430917	5797.1923152636309	3750.0414662644639	5996.9473408161966	3358.8774869002696	2.6114498723729489	1.6008253262648811	1.631314690945141318	9606.594204662073	8463.7144920515329	9282.5155500625533	8253.6981800986323	2.4566173188458134	2.2604183953919499	1.086797614040759819	10025.082901618482	7478.4497596462625	9624.387135205985	7179.2511319909891	2.3386761232635265	1.7579364690030979	1.330353038633846920	7920.7481353814965	5862.0835792093367	7841.9661277920522	5469.1501573472751	2.2958922039625254	1.5742084762237367	1.458442282987821!sample_table_end
