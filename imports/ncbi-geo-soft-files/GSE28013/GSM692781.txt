Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692781/suppl/GSM692781_JB0715_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692781/suppl/GSM692781_JB0715_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	1044.998373102263	1050.7520481738457	1057.9918384057678	1037.8194908359537	1.0200720800900926	0.99905491556955262	1.02103704630546612	391.32318258817185	425.09859568693054	417.68555334089626	414.14090036089749	0.43413005467777183	0.43133883824437291	1.00647105288445543	5187.8195422160697	3880.2909627632539	4903.6396640066996	3850.7663526054102	5.5174330069275923	4.1166320103493828	1.34027841037443654	2850.5431093416601	2535.9238618309905	2786.5435205036592	2519.2293293213679	2.0194881343320872	1.7977270625229085	1.12335636283850685	2538.1051337744952	2550.0527724387248	2487.8633654119099	2526.9607798348752	2.7636355454894486	2.8123255851238493	0.982686912250860136	2487.0397816377417	2729.7076533583595	2446.5518921253542	2709.3160161384576	3.017951911030762	3.2499586290303464	0.928612408808168097	2198.519598628669	2379.1631420685449	2167.3793771695027	2364.2012591597968	1.8744910868408136	2.0618437853847382	0.909133417443181998	1567.2540232889764	1197.1868129248874	1561.8493729708955	1183.7589778199203	1.4678576572282691	1.1362669750049601	1.2918246235413669	1840.7651722497385	1898.3644966548702	1823.2184505563978	1880.8691621070061	2.0444070505511709	2.0563686540079087	0.9941831424859427510	4593.6749632944548	5229.3754436754143	4389.1323101988983	5192.6061934274567	3.8291658163899709	4.3796440189305681	0.8743098297119099611	2536.5749755092461	2584.6103911247214	2482.8328870025912	2569.6505284429054	1.9603457835124647	2.0119723953414925	0.9743402981330342412	4366.7045192277501	4330.0143123079333	4230.4808993550159	4276.7067824165633	3.0399997297415067	2.9555232098222755	1.028582593984877213	3129.7070766389184	2794.0464714355721	3054.169983532046	2771.240222927383	2.8019581690209407	2.5238616271488037	1.110186921058069914	2401.6013651535636	2261.5685793614716	2355.7416594510892	2247.3135235112177	1.796079393145616	1.7114172918254293	1.049468999597336715	1205.4512677590862	1175.2406874647888	1212.2623073517411	1161.1375962006687	1.2444055645795302	1.1682028262821329	1.065230742969452116	2795.4803281734917	2299.8686045992772	2734.8619568541112	2285.1030110701058	2.8981742792594969	2.4890663050463098	1.164362023375498517	1176.9106921661469	1028.4696417047408	1185.1812836653394	1015.4990035898381	1.9319224682088953	1.6883649530835263	1.144256438562379718	2207.5433668339451	2216.5560936196393	2182.334654343957	2200.6646903370483	2.343132092455873	2.3449076048507038	0.9992428220237087319	2608.3943773093006	2128.4489268899274	2555.7863682665247	2113.9125032175875	2.3424695786497138	1.9501165271853123	1.201194670161942520	2252.2283024601788	1820.3802364576347	2214.3450268479492	1806.3796768640248	2.3563601412610358	1.8934456389309331	1.2444825944892037!sample_table_end
