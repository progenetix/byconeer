Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692775/suppl/GSM692775_JB0174_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692775/suppl/GSM692775_JB0174_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	1667.6986535647179	2187.3482347700869	1742.4816717885417	1742.922924933514	1.4939802807317171	1.4625941401344673	1.02145922763943542	546.70780382547196	758.54336166304699	528.73188368911076	810.00752528089288	0.52479915038929292	0.76181823803562709	0.688877115547278713	1266.60638381274	1454.6651523561809	1311.5608532150964	1303.1004731352473	1.6266764220878505	1.5717275287218462	1.03496082645488154	1013.280076852714	4832.6076967428553	1048.6325658831499	3092.4987504332557	1.0812621088679597	3.4694092323088364	0.311655972664947715	1286.2659160774563	5007.3132566161084	1336.0971876462004	3162.7564288868662	1.2738898422474842	2.8501700272047747	0.446952227441959566	1180.339108994599	2523.3236348998776	1225.9764067667127	1935.5128945828133	1.5173475898904449	2.1952465684272511	0.69119688499389127	963.2265662086462	1171.0470656803091	991.35719870093408	1116.4602491112291	0.78956764644767152	1.0072818779156074	0.783859675984187278	802.66792849929755	581.12300428787694	806.9760970457819	661.27242614296426	0.73639937570603542	0.63067718883790891	1.16763280603652579	1342.0783626038367	1040.8623283666009	1397.3152844570966	1023.5600505637007	1.3244303117331602	0.96495034360539844	1.372537271487584110	1774.7990533220766	3860.6897002525302	1852.4101944402767	2633.0405143155554	1.919450222242844	2.8114498327007773	0.6827261151585097811	1919.0938614223608	2763.8000231257988	2002.3803131754482	2067.7583188594622	1.6676764226370155	1.9564545785775267	0.8523972091647166212	1741.5532621331552	8237.4080661618609	1816.3052534022104	4582.6675625697944	1.7150242625990304	4.7579706565089204	0.3604528876723676113	1341.758352444311	2450.7787635895888	1388.5812902140344	1895.3297415654511	1.4183877181279372	1.8918263218524343	0.749745207445408414	1499.1625950138412	3020.2830075679753	1564.7351406361088	2205.6187715099086	1.2601885269708928	2.1107126632870274	0.5970440926849761615	1085.19517613943	1139.5209030524877	1119.4932790957171	1089.3232186013997	1.1197712176179158	1.1213348829686156	0.9986055322326546916	1473.3581839634119	1817.6906138491884	1530.2634812129779	1531.2172961668778	1.4115525502401125	1.3910465165488952	1.014741443544311817	445.05603422588086	546.62359273714344	415.45269548598782	627.49255762043504	0.71068414817849945	0.82972265868655093	0.8565321685965655618	1317.9761508171557	1638.8809665989418	1343.6790940314747	1417.5477303466637	1.5998881500211153	1.8212920314824705	0.8784358149960498419	2361.9908586528991	2121.130325665903	2431.9065718964384	1708.7833031682474	2.2921577118051499	1.6025436321767008	1.430324682449838120	1310.1049609884856	1761.7059815118375	1359.3071249587681	1497.2914422874628	1.1627146010735103	1.3174701937025051	0.88253579218055567!sample_table_end
