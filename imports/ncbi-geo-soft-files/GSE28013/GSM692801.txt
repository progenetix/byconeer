Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692801/suppl/GSM692801_JB0781_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692801/suppl/GSM692801_JB0781_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	1428.9417546063996	881.24924799099426	1391.6047044370107	882.38737373117954	1.7537422661750024	1.1317264663878452	1.54961673006769712	286.21225564734624	272.41062164685218	297.48438417399569	305.25552299031551	0.39529018354749274	0.39803806946499176	0.993096424366663013	2446.2767239000732	2959.3956243487532	2365.2332813724229	2653.7942046810567	3.0206259573993108	3.1722344849729125	0.952207654165610484	2611.7608361109969	1241.0675299184616	2529.0474072407424	1178.9630457650881	2.9997854050565045	1.4073898349216221	2.13145308472656625	1685.8981877945837	1235.3993859145332	1645.4157507898647	1167.5238627764099	2.1591516490692699	1.4891983212628128	1.44987515647905756	2717.6433930671574	1803.9403424223945	2627.6842222527207	1671.2414092783588	3.6431453972600449	2.2226803640477542	1.63907751028378297	751.54305834021682	614.55358714801025	742.01681197464643	632.08467586698703	0.8768098356919809	0.76361882407732617	1.14822972934359288	420.1158580687374	387.76878859477443	422.5852699087153	420.68538773182598	0.55409293391180614	0.53841749614654022	1.02911390858851219	1251.3559872466685	2330.3693911861697	1222.2806499069291	2119.729297597718	1.6104283320105846	2.6503154737067933	0.6076364674271027610	2523.880698356772	4159.7727346298889	2440.9734229909068	3686.3359530144508	3.0574521479204599	4.6193002618322163	0.6618864275144004111	2286.9358482672637	3500.0979508851356	2212.1137532723556	3121.6576928641944	2.7615578727147918	3.8081496515423465	0.7251705225387681312	7839.0008490297751	3224.9780426535481	7956.764035653955	2883.0357758020964	10.252185899911037	3.4957376326827956	2.932767552135491713	1595.5259990130739	2490.1497479695295	1553.5856203367416	2255.9570398491724	1.9557340244800163	2.8369237000168432	0.6893854862816383214	2236.6227821407142	2716.5852555305814	2163.1152758700246	2448.406624746226	2.6461342326473622	3.0233552484401129	0.8752309984123182215	1618.6614671378841	2145.1990417417869	1577.5514707222362	1961.920473184445	1.9017069907126365	2.414210665051256	0.7877137725560754416	1510.7027790657357	1583.6085868917187	1470.2684092628824	1484.412971565381	1.886743821353946	1.8513580122162614	1.019113433978835917	791.80824014223026	2049.6442087162727	780.13109423817411	1879.3215802191817	1.1336281983952348	2.567266042093995	0.4415702072974833618	1214.159962144289	1177.1706707781686	1186.4432027937926	1116.13741355306	1.5943540394466171	1.4662718596614246	1.0873522730053419	1253.9820122209671	2265.4209686837303	1225.7367478411356	2064.0654129351005	1.5090712027767066	2.5554666032825666	0.5905266775305391120	927.9548518814853	1108.3806745680677	912.57267744996659	1062.5554299736566	1.1813405325468003	1.3597488795027775	0.86879316493997305!sample_table_end
