Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692776/suppl/GSM692776_JB0175_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692776/suppl/GSM692776_JB0175_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	898.23323548819531	525.82963875598	625.30853083583156	667.8888586285575	1.2847389696549272	1.427322785131516	0.900104015039981942	328.18056824745491	161.01996372937222	238.63713024682002	254.8787179277503	0.53066537487168564	0.57708708932574804	0.919558563494636163	847.76600034286241	2005.7133031470207	588.23376519558565	1681.2112863834716	1.3548156445089838	4.2624778420635305	0.317846964772278424	705.0022717977705	193.20997670321134	492.45081307815707	297.29758881339268	1.5596850514018969	0.93623798714542061	1.66590661008891515	920.6778839372754	981.22447527653856	641.81794300007709	1032.2872805905229	1.3071128572197313	2.1913765159062772	0.596480270611622686	1302.7366739266174	725.67861505342239	898.25545360104627	830.28100761810026	2.2522960627931199	2.1302250411923449	1.05730428440201267	537.84432206202462	949.06682924265203	375.66899908803282	1010.4674316117064	0.73524365063948416	2.0599556886235244	0.356922071042595328	476.03367533277361	217.45788648137759	339.19827417556843	330.14727764177366	0.85052202118300346	0.83806259782826376	1.01486693641623799	849.28891920031106	520.09934851620335	589.09501377979223	653.38351137045049	1.2707529688725945	1.4189719439376249	0.8955448163029036110	745.10889693911383	1514.9716565278388	518.44384718021877	1386.8657861329982	1.4684644774654456	4.0704152143251804	0.3607652782687667511	837.21719653244497	1851.1622434820388	581.2556197202457	1587.0140828127344	1.2106044989511882	3.4668260926205758	0.3491967772851540312	903.06188294856258	344.77779561066041	629.14398217618964	478.94261639344171	1.6533726662142452	1.2836070837594713	1.288067577012579113	631.72883433806385	817.84149967529527	439.38536767910443	914.20877790959685	1.2016683396693593	2.5668454902889879	0.4681498532792753314	534.82485628052484	616.45532116609115	378.81617378085394	737.34627286192801	1.0535097512182852	2.1451033705830089	0.4911230692495512915	694.58988125828398	788.97882362379312	482.84674333584155	887.94763630841214	1.0622319126879165	2.1118935117880158	0.5029760765676993816	851.05067363459239	1197.0998057560321	593.44588792953618	1179.4187753550807	1.0597748392331674	2.2265716416162422	0.4759670964208855817	517.58895886788571	1144.2323978726354	361.05828414989458	1144.9236178917047	0.63042879426801879	1.9250101445216843	0.3274937516885991218	884.2059980591323	936.67584320570791	619.50424525446192	977.03170235339644	1.5465947453540534	2.5589007162635289	0.6043981056101190919	766.16304817817422	647.12135219659297	540.8952547817064	750.5161396825232	1.4264483442581255	1.980679743162385	0.7201812151522463120	900.57167344928735	715.37515642493474	626.30648249153262	834.29072364187709	1.1076216729142041	1.5954489125929674	0.69423825744070167!sample_table_end
