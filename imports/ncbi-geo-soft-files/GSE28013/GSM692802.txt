Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692802/suppl/GSM692802_JB0782_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692802/suppl/GSM692802_JB0782_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	843.46111389694283	821.46460615932347	885.58785210199846	772.83903015051749	1.2644690868642994	1.1327710406375617	1.11626184065635512	235.09234483014683	303.10412291150647	267.70017168452534	283.10227267698497	0.36559688513192834	0.41820223359999886	0.874210742455320163	1538.9777537841994	2120.3034616996397	1577.4952421461087	1938.2159495006981	2.0895531120145785	2.672187767567368	0.781963429881578744	2579.9832307400065	1639.6051295701332	2579.9302065081101	1507.9900399306812	3.3973612842264429	1.9959693604769335	1.70211093992677895	1321.1541114604943	1241.705460216542	1364.2027836519728	1150.7703863315066	1.7924996783559664	1.6674117955285377	1.0750191903181176	2722.1927162038073	1665.2684161931086	2746.3610233383097	1530.9889615003131	4.0766980494585239	2.3671598697948553	1.72218957472095997	713.69075396140329	723.27862078364285	755.10859418651785	680.55543684033444	1.0457837932398995	0.97419981150267776	1.07347977375073138	465.72031583777613	361.06770360181395	502.26369511202739	338.67826719847602	0.66758981537744699	0.46965309018957424	1.42145304549785099	1301.5338161077805	1620.8751328194585	1343.9780213479391	1491.7131262314269	1.896366870469459	2.1109468651509267	0.8983489360988127210	2882.392542724981	3797.7670733481159	2919.9070292962128	3445.5622795205477	4.0979550580728539	5.0187733187166401	0.816525233923246511	1738.9071898392958	2606.576736191148	1769.4188340211215	2376.0272135565733	2.4671972518033156	3.3065561090144584	0.7461531486119800112	4679.6451993526207	4260.6552605150573	4868.8311110674949	3849.2435354422159	6.9001357937361538	5.2251588441496963	1.320560005838258913	1634.1989165880425	1823.452484328265	1669.7239850195306	1672.2308666093704	2.3066100708172108	2.4165493179854987	0.9545056886072839114	1611.9752789606546	1831.884988583143	1647.8433125175864	1679.4431447605405	2.2918019508357119	2.3251004390957113	0.985678688240689615	1206.7331422717821	1404.965978407377	1250.5417783080945	1298.1773872068291	1.7209810124747817	1.8865376241278782	0.9122431434519461316	1511.2812694579673	1576.4467816175991	1550.4936082347178	1451.4360482971274	2.303861310137068	2.2307128741982427	1.032791506600828917	909.65854094190274	1380.6028579500301	952.35579003482405	1276.0953506655403	1.320228831703667	1.9525662693300758	0.6761505883007169518	1345.1260293337677	1091.1701324308153	1387.9161772949133	1015.9616674245141	2.0019795701032108	1.4856285084824263	1.347564050280805519	1101.7621482356324	1602.7471087825961	1145.1155326311996	1475.0114788655846	1.4509284682304899	1.9694843297765667	0.7367047537743517420	1121.4500227400904	985.98381014507197	1165.3039721138334	922.57832675143584	1.574998559556414	1.3320229637386654	1.1824109662011946!sample_table_end
