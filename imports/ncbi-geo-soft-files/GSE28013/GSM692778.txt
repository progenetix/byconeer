Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately (As previously reported Chen, S. et. al. Cancer Biol Ther. 2008 Nov;7(11):1793-802. PMID: 18836286 ).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.  Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = CBS Segmentation Data provided as a supplementary file.!Sample_data_processing = The normalized log ratios from each color reversal experiment were averaged for each segmentation. We then applied the CBS algorithm to this data. The CBS segmentation method is the circular binary segmentation algorithm as described in "Circular binary segmentation for the analysis of array-based DNA copy number data.", Olshen AB, Venkatraman ES, Lucito R, Wigler M., Biostatistics. 2004 Oct;5:557-72 (PMID:15475419).!Sample_data_processing = Seg.mean.txt is the average of normalized log ratios for each experiment.!Sample_data_processing = chrom: Chromosome!Sample_data_processing = loc.start: Chromosome Segment Start Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = loc.end: Chromoseom Segment End Location (1000kb)!Sample_data_processing = num.mark: Number of Markers in the Segment!Sample_data_processing = seg.mean: The Segment Mean!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Kazimierz,O.,Wrzeszczynski!Sample_contact_email = kwrzeszc@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 516-367-8395!Sample_contact_laboratory = Rob Luctio!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = One Bungtown Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692778/suppl/GSM692778_JB0177_ROMA.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM692nnn/GSM692778/suppl/GSM692778_JB0177_ROMA_segmean.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28013!Sample_series_id = GSE28015!Sample_data_row_count = 82055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalized value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized output for each spot in green#VALUE = log ratio of the two local normalized values for each probe (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE1	10524.821844942067	8569.8166595496023	9603.9934253436622	9264.6352578713613	2.544307498540558	2.4189259102577987	1.05183357942095722	868.71965376227104	860.19145488594825	864.13180263091579	875.56086852928797	0.22180367226792116	0.22577844052674198	0.982395271003078663	39083.191977828181	21610.601372971731	31072.813577877445	24291.795858320649	8.2407471334679663	6.5612798720270327	1.25596641115723064	2547.3995975100092	2011.856769484428	2421.9978277485829	2119.4655041669512	0.63090984092327562	0.56070640659279025	1.12520533652733935	12228.313386527007	10267.997414499661	11116.89427726577	11131.136438614185	2.9285781434550779	3.0297854867331164	0.966595871647941146	11288.118840890922	8608.8385246019589	10278.48329904172	9308.150088373608	2.9035325010174069	2.6616674177830317	1.09086976142039247	8991.4482656290347	8364.0966215548324	8232.1353103224446	9038.9127587343046	2.1458040818970296	2.3395325838260077	0.917193501271027288	1680.734249178048	1353.1594759496561	1625.4339908295135	1407.8413339545907	0.4158488068526206	0.36749749352190286	1.13156909688646939	7437.570193417183	6419.7723841713005	6844.8779893608807	6911.0727833859701	1.8261021953462517	1.9503765105167883	0.9362818848050996610	30103.395169542306	25425.972092697299	25106.415420537563	29091.04302649797	6.9779197670023185	7.5474677772244352	0.9245378679269341511	40948.277236746413	28813.44849443949	32290.875839759941	33414.427276475224	8.8363707323831413	8.8886594382956279	0.9941173687353562812	7285.5977059439774	5413.4162353799184	6710.0219296794294	5809.9107593030421	1.6341465645888078	1.4272851518410168	1.144933486122913713	10860.415715275174	9854.4105011726115	9899.36910095032	10677.82758967416	2.6541683166671399	2.8323363277972082	0.9370950372731214914	6773.8938622662554	6496.6070709235801	6242.9164863648903	6995.2362931656271	1.7448100261250807	1.8572425085180804	0.939462680895285415	10832.888673700536	8509.3773656685535	9875.6516512387861	9198.0400365557362	2.5328167947003259	2.4947494546616107	1.01525898320874816	7468.7438275366612	6167.9331950430123	6873.6802522330318	6634.5900971789242	1.9860076901375383	1.9781723429728189	1.003960902189616317	7320.9169448107559	5515.7652057692949	6739.0937894557974	5932.4474431783819	1.8549392159751292	1.7757050430483672	1.044621246775725918	18722.705760595974	12302.716919952392	16697.489194221085	13372.607642255949	4.8351414289249872	3.8898758969216156	1.243006604079950319	12587.588362934541	9896.4490977987443	11440.477525805687	10723.192968240106	2.8266150806696748	2.714393550659655	1.041343131685067420	4696.319094834952	3543.8770908080651	4387.1988952860302	3794.7344900031817	1.1995009297834733	1.015014205214656	1.1817577760202893!sample_table_end
