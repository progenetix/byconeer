The digested DNA fragments were labeled with cyanine-3 dUTP or cyanine-5 dUTP using Agilent Genomic DNA Enzymatic Labeling Kit (Agilent p/n 5190-0449). Then Microcon YM-30 (Millipore) was used to clear up the labeled probes.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = [REF] Commercial Human Genomic DNA: Male!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = reference: Commercial Human Genomic DNA!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: Male!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = company (vendor): Promega!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = catalog#: G1471!Sample_growth_protocol_ch2 = Biopsy tissue and surgical tissue were stored at -80 â before DNA extraction.!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Genomic DNA was extracted using Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit following manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_label_ch2 = cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = 500 ng the reference commercial genomic DNA (promega) and the same amount of carcinoma DNA (or 400 ng the reference commercial genomic DNA and the same amount of dysplasia DNA ) were digested with Alu I (promega) and RSA I (promega) following Agilent's instructions.
