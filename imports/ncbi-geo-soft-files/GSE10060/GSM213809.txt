The generated CEL. file and TXT. file were imported into a dChip software for copy number analysis. Regional LOH was identified whenever an uninterrupted contiguous stretch of >50 homozygous (AA or BB) genotypes was encountered, with the segments of DNA greater than ~15Mb. !Sample_platform_id = GPL2641!Sample_contact_name = Luan,,Yang!Sample_contact_email = luanyang@mail.shcnc.ac.cn!Sample_contact_institute = Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica , Chinese Academy of Sciences!Sample_contact_address = 555 Zu Chong Zhi Road , Zhang Jiang Hi-Tech Park, Pudong,!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 201203!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213809/suppl/GSM213809.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213809/suppl/GSM213809.CHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE10060!Sample_data_row_count = 10208#ID_REF = #VALUE = VALUE#CONFIDENCE = confidence score#RAS1 = sense#RAS2 = antisense#P-VALUE AA = genotype calls#P-VALUE AB = genotype calls#P-VALUE BB = genotype calls#P-VALUE NO CALL = genotype calls!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	RAS1	RAS2	P-VALUE AA	P-VALUE AB	P-VALUE BB	P-VALUE NO CALLAFFX-5Q-123	No Call	5676	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-456	No Call	2809.5	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-789	No Call	8194	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-ABC	No Call	9694	0	0	0	0	0	0SNP_A-1513509	BB	0.0295012	0.0455882	0	0.0455882	0	0	0SNP_A-1518411	AA	0.0168651	1	0.985577	1	0.985577	0	0SNP_A-1511066	AA	0.0448458	1	0.906737	1	0.906737	0	0SNP_A-1517367	AA	0.0265001	1	0.931129	1	0.931129	0	0SNP_A-1512567	AB	0.62655	0.423329	0.567178	0.423329	0.567178	0	0SNP_A-1519604	AA	0.0240803	0.884615	0.938224	0.884615	0.938224	0	0SNP_A-1507932	AB	0.211699	0.444444	0.565491	0.444444	0.565491	0	0SNP_A-1519685	AB	0.508325	0.71997	0.5	0.71997	0.5	0	0SNP_A-1516165	AA	0	1	1	1	1	0	0SNP_A-1514890	BB	0.356405	0.150979	0.159533	0.150979	0.159533	0	0SNP_A-1507580	AB	0.323586	0.551195	0.401255	0.551195	0.401255	0	0SNP_A-1510991	AB	0.430404	0.388184	0.323944	0.388184	0.323944	0	0SNP_A-1516205	AA	0.221803	1	0.962725	1	0.962725	0	0SNP_A-1512666	AB	0.528331	0.322245	0.700227	0.322245	0.700227	0	0SNP_A-1512740	AB	0.361387	0.632258	0.527561	0.632258	0.527561	0	0SNP_A-1512132	AA	0.148462	0.908113	0.989871	0.908113	0.989871	0	0!sample_table_end
