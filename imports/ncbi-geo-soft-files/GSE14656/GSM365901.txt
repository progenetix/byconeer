Cryopreserved cell lines which had been established at the time of initial diagnosis as previously described, passaged not more than 4-5 times, were thawed and grown in culture for at most two passages in RPMI media with 10% FBS. When 80 to 90% confluent, cells were collected by trypsinization, and pelleted by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 3 minutes. DNA was extracted using the Qiagen kit!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = The Affymetrix 100K SNP array was used for all experiments, according to the methods described by the manufacturer (http://www.affymetrix.com). Briefly, 250 ng of tumor, cell line and control DNA were each digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme (Hind III/Xba1) and ligated to an adaptor sequence (Xba/Hind). For each sample, the ligated DNA was PCR amplified under recommended conditions, using primers complementary to the adapters. Purified PCR products were fragmented and end-labeled with biotinylated ddATP, using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The labeled DNA was hybridized to the 100K SNP chips, washed, incubated with streptavidin, and stained with biotinylated antistreptavidin antibody and a streptavidin R-phycoerythrin conjugate.!Sample_scan_protocol = The chips were scanned with an HP scanner (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.!Sample_description = 09X_4793C_x.CEL!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix genotyping software (Affymetrix GeneChip 5.0) was used to examine the SNP hybridization patterns and to make SNP calls of all loci in each of the tumor samples and their corresponding matched controls.!Sample_data_processing = Analysis_of_LOH: The resulting data were analyzed with the dChip software package, freely available from http://www.dchip.org. At each locus, an LOH call was assigned through the following rules: LOH (AB in blood, A or B in tumor/cell line; blue), ROH or retention of heterozygosity (AB in both blood and tumor/cell line; yellow)]; non-informative (A or B in blood; gray); no call (SNP no call in either blood or tumor/cell line; white), or conflict A or B in blood, B or A or AB in tumor/cell line; red). Larger areas of LOH were obtained by using hidden Markov models to infer the LOH status at non-informative SNPs.!Sample_data_processing = Measurement_of_DNA_Copy_Number_Change: Copy number changes were calculated by comparing the normal and tumor samples, using the dChip software as previously described. The patient blood samples were averaged for use as normal for copy number comparison. As in our previous work, copy number gain was defined as between 2.8 and 5 copies. Amplification was defined as more than 5 copies, and copy number loss was defined as less than 1.2 copies.!Sample_data_processing = Data_Analysis: LOH data and inferred copy number data were exported from dChip for subsequent analysis. Further data manipulation was performed using Python scripts (http://www.python.org). A custom suite of Python scripts was developed to manipulate and analyze dChip-exported SNP and LOH data. Furthermore, visualization tools were created that facilitated the display of copy number changes and LOH events throughout the genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Samuel,,Volchenboum!Sample_contact_email = slv@uchicago.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 773-702-4303!Sample_contact_institute = University of Chicago!Sample_contact_address = 5640 S.
