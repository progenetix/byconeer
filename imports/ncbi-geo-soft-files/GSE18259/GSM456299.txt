The amplification method (i.e., LMP or WGA) and the amount of input DNA for all reference samples matched the test sample.!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = 1 microgram of amplified material was labelled with Cy3-dUTP (GE Healthcare) using the Bioprime Array CGH kit (Invitrogen). Labeled material was cleaned using the columns included with the labeling kit.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Labeled test and reference samples were each mixed with 125 micrograms of Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen) and 30 micrograms of yeast tRNA, concentrated, and hybridized to arrays under conditions described previously (L.W.
