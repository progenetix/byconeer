Genomic material was amplified  by ligation-mediated PCR (LMP).!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 1 microgram of amplified material was labelled with Cy5-dUTP (GE Healthcare) using the Bioprime Array CGH kit (Invitrogen). Labeled material was cleaned using the columns included with the labeling kit.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Female peripheral blood!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: Female peripheral blood!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Reference DNA was obtained from the peripheral blood of a single female individual, isolated using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA), and quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The amplification method (i.e., LMP or WGA) and the amount of input DNA for all reference samples matched the test sample.!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = 1 microgram of amplified material was labelled with Cy3-dUTP (GE Healthcare) using the Bioprime Array CGH kit (Invitrogen). Labeled material was cleaned using the columns included with the labeling kit.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Labeled test and reference samples were each mixed with 125 micrograms of Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen) and 30 micrograms of yeast tRNA, concentrated, and hybridized to arrays under conditions described previously (L.W.
