BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the July 2003 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3442!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE8067!Sample_data_row_count = 15528#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = spot signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = background signal of channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = spot signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = background signal of channel 1 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = #Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#VALUE = same as UNF_VALUE but with flagged values removed#UNF_VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio.
