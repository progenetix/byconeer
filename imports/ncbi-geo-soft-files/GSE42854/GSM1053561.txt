DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Biotinylated DNA was prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from genomic DNA.!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Tumor, sty array!Sample_data_processing = Image data were analysed!Sample_data_processing = Primary data description: Data files were generated using the Affymetrix gene chip operating (GCOS) and gene chip genotyping analysis (GTYPE) software suites. GTYPE version 4.1 was used for the analysis of signal intensity and to determine genotype calls. Since no matched normal DNA was available, unpaired analysis using an independent reference set was performed. The complete data set was analyzed as combined subarrays (500K) by visual inspection using CNAT 4.0 (Affymetrix) and the copy number analyzer for gene chip (CNAG) v3.0 and by an algorithm described by Lenz and coworkers!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = SÃ­lvia,,BeÃ !Sample_contact_email = sbea@clinic.cat!Sample_contact_phone = +34 93 2275536!Sample_contact_fax = +34 93 2275717!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Pathology!Sample_contact_department = HematoPathology!Sample_contact_institute = Hospital Clinic!Sample_contact_address = Rossello, 153!Sample_contact_city = Barcelona!Sample_contact_state = Barcelona!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 08036!Sample_contact_country = Spain!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1053nnn/GSM1053561/suppl/GSM1053561_ID3-SLN950_STY.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE42854!Sample_series_id = GSE42935!Sample_data_row_count = 0
