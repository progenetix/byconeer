Further analysis was performed using scripts described in [Maruyama et al] primary data description: Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, and NoCall; 'Confidence' = Confidence call from RSG algorithm.  Values left blank represent NA, not available.!Sample_data_processing = Customized algorithm used to generate the data. We processed three SNP data (three CEL files: luminal parent, basal parent and their heterofusion) at the same time to generate ONE processed data (TableS4-SNP-updated_121114.xlsx).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Kornelia,,Polyak!Sample_contact_email = kornelia_polyak@dfci.harvard.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 617-632-2106!Sample_contact_laboratory = Polyak!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Dana-Farber Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 450 Brookline Ave!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02215!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM967nnn/GSM967824/suppl/GSM967824_43_SUM159-MCF7_SNP6.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38548!Sample_series_id = GSE39412!Sample_data_row_count = 934147#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype#Confidence = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	ConfidenceSNP_A-8575125	NoCall	SNP_A-8575115	NoCall	SNP_A-8575371	NoCall	SNP_A-8709646	NoCall	SNP_A-8497791	NoCall	SNP_A-1909444	BB	0SNP_A-8358063	NoCall	SNP_A-8329892	NoCall	SNP_A-8408912	BB	0SNP_A-8294056	NoCall	SNP_A-1886933	NoCall	SNP_A-2236359	NoCall	SNP_A-8515688	BB	0SNP_A-2205441	AA	0SNP_A-8524447	NoCall	SNP_A-8573955	BB	0SNP_A-8530278	BB	0SNP_A-8573668	BB	0SNP_A-8573414	NoCall	999SNP_A-8531044	NoCall	999!sample_table_end
