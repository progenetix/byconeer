Further analysis was performed using scripts described in [Maruyama et al] primary data description: Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, and NoCall; 'Confidence' = Confidence call from RSG algorithm. Values left blank represent NA, not available.!Sample_data_processing = Customized algorithm used to generate the data. We processed three SNP data (three CEL files: luminal parent, basal parent and their heterofusion) at the same time to generate ONE processed data (TableS4-SNP-updated_121114.xlsx).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Kornelia,,Polyak!Sample_contact_email = kornelia_polyak@dfci.harvard.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 617-632-2106!Sample_contact_laboratory = Polyak!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Dana-Farber Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 450 Brookline Ave!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02215!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1664nnn/GSM1664566/suppl/GSM1664566_2_21NT.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38548!Sample_series_id = GSE39412!Sample_data_row_count = 0
