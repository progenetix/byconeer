The precipitated DNA was dissolved in 30 Î¼l hybridisation buffer, incubated at 37Â°C for 2 hours and applied to the prehybridised microarray. Hybridisation was performed in a humified Micro Array Hybridisation Chamber (Camlab, Cambridge, UK) at 37Â°C for 48 hours under a coverslip. The arrays then washed successively in 1xPBS/0.05% Tween20 at room temperature for 15 min twice, 50% formamide/2xSSC at 42Â°C for 30 min once, 1 x PBS/0.05% Tween 20 at room temperature for 15 min and 1 x PBS for 5 min twice. Dried by centrifugation.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4100A personal scanner. Images were quantified using GenePix Pro version 5.1.!Sample_data_processing = The median of the ratio of test reference spot intensity, after subtraction of local background was used as the normalization factor. The chromosomal arm on which the most microsatellite markers showed allelic balance was chosen for normalization. The test/reference ratio of each clone was devided by normalization factor of each subarray, an avarage of the duplicate calculated and log2-transformed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL18586!Sample_contact_name = Anna,,Kwiecinska!Sample_contact_email = anna.kwiecinska@ki.se!Sample_contact_department = Oncology-Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Karolinska Institute!Sample_contact_address = CCK R8:00!Sample_contact_city = Stockholm!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 17176!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1370nnn/GSM1370619/suppl/GSM1370619_case_20_1Mb_Plots4x4V6_Batch1441_Slide77_Array2.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE56884!Sample_data_row_count = 3038
