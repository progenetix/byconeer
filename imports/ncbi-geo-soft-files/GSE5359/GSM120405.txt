After addition of 250 Âµl of 75 mM NaCl/24 mM EDTA, 25 Âµl 10% SDS and 10 Âµl Proteinase K (10 mg/ml) the mix is vortexed and incubated for 4 hours at 37Â°C in a water bath or on a rotating thermomixer (850 rpm). Phenol (300 Âµl) is added, mixed, and the sample is spun down 3-5 min at 13,000 rpm. The aqueous (upper) phase is collected with a pipette and transferred in a new tube. After adding 300 Âµl of chloroform/isoamylalcohol (96% CHCl3/ 4% IAA) the solution is well shaken and centrifuged 3-5 min at 13,000 rpm. The last two steps have to be repeated 2 times. Next, the upper phase is transferred to a new tube, and 50 Âµl NaOAc and 900 Âµl 100% ethanol are added. The DNA precipitates from the solution after inverting the tube. The DNA is removed, washed in 70% ethanol, 15 min dried in the air, and dissolved in TE buffer (on a rolling device for about 2 days).!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming.

Detailed protocols are available at our website!Sample_description = see Gratias et al., submitted!Sample_data_processing = TIFF images were analysed by Genepix 5.0 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and raw intensities (gpr files) were imported into CGHPRO (Chen et al., 2005). Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgrid LOWESS and chromosomal regions sharing the same DNA copy number were segmented by circular binary segmentation. Segments exceeding a log2 ratio of +/- 0.2 were considered as an aberration.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3960!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE5359!Sample_data_row_count = 37209
