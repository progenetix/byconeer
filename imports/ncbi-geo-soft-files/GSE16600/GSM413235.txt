Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413235/suppl/GSM413235_NN502.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413235/suppl/GSM413235_NN503.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16600!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2674.4658595135861	4529.5008094151208	2859.4931088402964	4169.7280555715251	1.3530169783735784	1.9100069012666476	0.70838329300082958	-0.3341	0.793283376482022072	3842.9075746178974	4544.0247846688726	4012.9962050658319	4178.6430841725323	1.6938011172448462	1.7438665902150874	0.97129053721703218	-0.3098	0.80677359415301023	1874.2466248366341	1924.3827634280308	2044.9922439489785	1757.4048787634201	0.892583464265158	0.78513008185332023	1.1368606106114176	0.1816	1.13411003553726554	6503.3920882436851	7351.6685595329245	6524.0947337028265	6863.3782070586685	3.7007963417780259	3.9048943775056975	0.94773276406568463	-0.2692	0.82979365779215535	14739.497144038889	16041.301705540409	14342.719133851593	15237.874405182845	5.9213259203995721	6.3448248057478089	0.93325286381988259	-0.1917	0.87557445776899196	4664.6598718063869	4895.7323547444339	4801.2812035665929	4518.7700411305286	2.2114187563179835	2.1009211791392119	1.0525948228215039	-0.0590	0.959937484084645087	852.50125842554655	967.64485710807344	968.75325542543942	900.78643118350954	0.46968719606183285	0.47940434459388143	0.97973078750406362	0.1103	1.07945213083156948	1748.9009282617424	1850.6216256206028	1914.2521352026404	1691.79193524108	0.88951170654565892	0.79012901827611504	1.1257803295041293	0.2260	1.16958577673274699	3308.7526931585785	4223.5393410443985	3488.0643269244256	3883.5252566703325	1.6152795498786459	1.7827218176569746	0.90607493209546419	-0.1167	0.9222807356203277510	3814.845265941909	6423.7242009944521	3985.0224446638126	5971.6393904356928	2.1489638663233945	3.3740631768028915	0.63690682530718201	-0.4454	0.7343786708520093611	6822.1551083966551	9913.5815419273767	6817.8395965139034	9351.2450187886752	4.0749940132507501	5.7711626880598947	0.70609584818698812	-0.3813	0.7677546769018727112	3753.728108917534	4365.6357023613355	3926.3629812011081	4018.2504111440771	2.2941608443243076	2.4007390239047548	0.95560609524016527	0.1749	1.128915754460071613	1815.502569393441	4119.3085091547	1984.8851184389011	3787.4443597851086	1.0272859555742411	1.6860430244059419	0.60928810279689849	-0.4605	0.7267101485117564214	8273.0113180935168	8644.667752006997	8174.7878416337408	8118.4747226341578	4.2909806524434151	4.1798189273312083	1.0265948661999054	0.0414	1.029135988416221215	3064.1197208620943	3814.9797476464264	3247.6894415405568	3500.1624511896766	1.5261459933039363	1.6198563173301803	0.94214898999147312	-0.1734	0.8867526033358860116	1329.5705143521632	2444.9994507362621	1476.5041942452488	2232.3969782241611	0.71600146345130478	1.0924342613126161	0.65541835221369948	-0.3434	0.7881722204794405817	717.34856228990111	603.93154333543475	821.43330622960275	575.47903256494158	0.34991608638697685	0.2568258901404864	1.3624642211716627	0.3619	1.285152642950041518	3237.4742234521141	4078.1916085190287	3418.3615537819264	3745.9668724562775	1.8509371126183145	2.0128836258132825	0.91954501933536514	-0.1743	0.8861743515000122319	1827.3976639331368	2575.6996659272268	1997.0964596985032	2354.3491727687256	0.883820046535573	1.0190894327975097	0.86726445991044399	-0.1118	0.9254596927830146520	1628.6369670281886	2295.7440778286827	1790.7908069895257	2095.2514943791289	0.7714748857223197	0.94617287721097454	0.81536356019461209	-0.4989	0.70766207242917667!sample_table_end
