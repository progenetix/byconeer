Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413305/suppl/GSM413305_NN506.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413305/suppl/GSM413305_NN507.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16600!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1514.6425248091996	1283.5272236238159	1608.3834361541255	1185.7140463861542	1.2862753261652788	0.95889310414405204	1.3414168071564785	0.0837	1.05972841636305362	1802.7943413246956	1903.9796508781744	1908.7682250660471	1745.9369841756709	1.6173530716925346	1.4964331269802229	1.0808054449825808	0.0910	1.065099297883893	925.65756198200631	970.3472621172084	995.8701774988125	901.89981212096552	0.92425596615969019	0.84538738459832374	1.0932928300069675	0.0967	1.06933643046617344	3634.117035734444	4745.1689043908491	3764.9491441259802	4304.2059679506847	4.2104788648592208	4.7774919030006116	0.88131575109833971	-0.1098	0.926717737303557225	6713.8230816460828	10326.956874531958	6887.9215211478304	9420.9528027750803	6.0643445479828415	8.4686730851353698	0.71609146875999674	-0.4632	0.725398965834323066	2466.8669567536745	4303.8549692742654	2590.6975448215298	3891.6256359753879	2.2627658226430718	3.4174431052707037	0.66212245615829568	-0.5358	0.689755111732788697	762.48070456274854	972.87100736473565	826.20605286688419	905.73903659328471	0.62529913496285761	0.70238300371786266	0.89025379551187367	-0.2261	0.854922072930723868	814.36711976919992	1128.0350665868507	881.28662924012383	1048.9337503717516	0.80137063677781328	0.97724698715992342	0.82002876172251782	-0.1800	0.882711329958018159	1943.5178329685605	1819.1743775912007	2052.5994382234649	1672.0287425358913	1.8504397524562997	1.4994085689803858	1.234113096815646	0.1093	1.078675564782940710	4054.5665298992722	5992.125446897664	4185.9291456770516	5417.8188509661395	4.1020141029187602	5.3364982417890969	0.76867149899847653	-0.1041	0.9303951050895219511	2838.1670222132439	4153.1861097134188	2966.1996711403312	3756.757734296998	3.0266278643807216	3.7972311519696649	0.7970617914083995	-0.4857	0.7141588269193730512	2030.9176551071562	3709.9582098341889	2143.0839080302612	3363.7600206666957	2.318557252096165	3.5725245924922735	0.64899686260205336	-0.4649	0.7245375019889134213	1129.9357954315467	1258.5256936320236	1209.2303222425151	1163.5960141133335	1.2874124893245931	1.2170407976957036	1.0578219660032171	0.0011	1.000746588315652614	3003.1861328688474	4416.2535672246877	3132.076463277353	3992.5467572564294	3.0871884653641586	3.7807750589914395	0.81654909831840061	-0.1422	0.9061399943370399615	897.16727818564766	1057.7618297426748	966.64933910136585	980.92784299701168	0.82714669807237795	0.80544690185238799	1.0269413119227155	-0.0959	0.9356577216894649316	1157.1729607557863	1258.9283831899938	1236.5067460600894	1163.2860353093604	0.9280857460339702	0.9320139887992096	0.99578521050923219	0.2697	1.205598297251530217	372.08316304341878	297.3616133077748	413.21300597278241	296.52428929462343	0.38144657130746529	0.28295826556012843	1.3480665445569333	0.0372	1.02609416177489618	1902.8655979890661	2129.8321814907681	2010.0515864545125	1950.0650863979533	2.0389766086800933	1.9254904456195518	1.0589388346842852	-0.0542	0.9631473190019254119	973.69093055694486	1029.2366266254478	1045.5580407788009	955.58982513578133	0.9220751632740285	0.86426086872398855	1.066894495218091	0.0600	1.042459746232032420	893.25515680601973	915.56612163321483	961.97481984703063	853.49674310876844	0.82987433309423519	0.74767165691215842	1.109944887467808	0.0745	1.0529690781939987!sample_table_end
