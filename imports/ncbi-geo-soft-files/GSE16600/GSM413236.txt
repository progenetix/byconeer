Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413236/suppl/GSM413236_NN522.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413236/suppl/GSM413236_NN523.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16600!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1391.3046759987042	2094.6294847742511	1547.2190534104209	1820.1657962678034	1.1728757064732054	1.4823975783670147	0.7912018500227358	-0.1572	0.896735631171715182	1689.1218920262013	1934.3657130962949	1851.7897815043596	1691.71187124173	1.2820714642966609	1.3201641632085652	0.97114548328647032	-0.0625	0.95757300139470983	1013.1177907389674	1125.7965515277524	1146.370595683828	1018.7277501671733	0.72798033094388048	0.72394987784908171	1.0055673095860913	0.0624	1.04417379304727944	6415.7967889995734	7023.326791107309	6297.1688650860933	5761.9055482621125	4.8943657679827179	4.7331460814629596	1.034061844647298	-0.0039	0.997318650428136725	5025.3556883750753	14071.415000696999	5051.8892294143534	10836.810657526368	3.7028852401725922	8.5607655293775089	0.4325413688139928	-1.0011	0.499632611848195356	3416.4004453620946	4392.5727620489379	3543.5069716899629	3701.4583235375185	3.4129039039405189	3.5701763262320796	0.95594827596161236	0.0213	1.01487486807430787	668.44173377199854	741.4796357878663	765.43023913448167	698.13196791529356	0.65361651652815012	0.60795418752461106	1.0751081741692756	0.3593	1.28282317343437698	1060.9243083913286	1479.8058168199454	1197.3174656759313	1310.5702796700193	0.8899678909422668	1.0825100079734	0.82213363792211291	0.0747	1.05314940842272269	2554.152013387984	3059.7592332571026	2709.8935581264786	2621.1543127978607	1.9202993380105486	1.8636015077903099	1.0304237949922384	0.0236	1.016469519759317910	1600.524631068349	3114.9114840644211	1767.5313747303169	2663.861062446761	1.8632524631691998	2.9169494642792828	0.63876748157156382	-0.3353	0.7926180003471203811	2581.1954755066263	5976.9939697972923	2737.1913899759306	4955.6310775246193	2.5156324130131296	4.2203407282625625	0.59607329715503077	-0.4521	0.7309611523962394912	3042.7383278014972	3054.6900087249169	3183.5031402968079	2617.6913550583517	2.9828644501549153	2.4253647304309749	1.229862219372208	-0.0247	0.9830122345594224413	758.38443218668169	1380.2079725503179	865.20018750461998	1231.3467893655031	0.99614470214053308	1.1717810199172649	0.8501116550009209	-0.3520	0.7834903290155673714	2937.6906242369605	6215.4077398677964	3085.4205848126198	5139.5099853989595	2.5570528995713215	4.307293987783364	0.59365645967603009	-0.4237	0.7455244294928965515	826.66574858655054	1367.2248133366309	942.68324582152809	1220.4643034000737	0.68582934165230647	1.0543361019428061	0.65048454699458846	-0.2593	0.8355024395443888516	477.35247387308647	888.288347649348	543.59853023316236	821.45739551310396	0.46314906918663257	0.66457206113533351	0.69691324127499976	-0.3989	0.7584364320453879117	304.70284789217339	440.68432515906989	325.99282344911006	444.32162307384129	0.25953859541073671	0.31662837911854691	0.81969467213665193	-0.3789	0.7690424386611767218	1631.1899568384501	2483.9121045226411	1793.654351706457	2148.6141562608286	1.5503809001541911	1.7290345605093196	0.89667432656609092	-0.1754	0.8855283330728470619	579.78768973911815	900.65960182999549	662.70141823941822	830.51294360810118	0.44744139570236124	0.63243380986230679	0.70749126426333531	-0.3460	0.7867772486920036120	690.57627069529713	877.51516877386541	790.01262500586552	811.78850957142777	0.67304014467878148	0.69318497230338527	0.9709387415632158	-0.3749	0.77116635946318579!sample_table_end
