Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413234/suppl/GSM413234_NN501.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413234/suppl/GSM413234_NN502.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16600!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	5182.3452445428366	3195.7569827084826	4496.9685811645577	3616.2007957320084	1.8609330513981599	1.4913225079385206	0.80138428774643833	-0.3194	0.801384287746438332	2738.1001182167829	2522.8965400921174	2277.2676552655494	2942.2170883599447	1.1301630450894433	1.3560439313249997	1.1998657514214504	0.2629	1.19986575142145043	2390.9162762704914	1799.0759418220512	1964.1925203941496	2189.2607904376637	1.0505782553733776	1.0621682940816968	1.0110320565355693	0.0158	1.01103205653556934	8111.6551376921507	9891.1892303735094	7207.1179507597226	9611.8940916176598	3.9682391621553825	5.0869255944396148	1.2819100327805359	0.3583	1.28191003278053595	13456.074097313307	14272.796990488203	12087.938048598771	13838.127902763357	5.8737754624454288	6.1408453724993759	1.0454681851156018	0.0641	1.04546818511560186	5366.7467140020408	3284.4318907383572	4661.7843812957872	3702.4194869260446	2.4643617830177749	1.8144990023423655	0.73629570741045614	-0.4416	0.736295707410456147	1628.1876017320933	1294.1281292063086	1315.7152343255034	1628.5937134359999	0.48971207437234077	0.53165535704950828	1.0856488636326274	0.1186	1.08564886363262748	2037.6811720957514	1336.5771908758036	1663.0969760610114	1676.5520699338647	0.84948610404782188	0.80801329295317459	0.95117894113037482	-0.0722	0.951178941130374829	4055.6164197969247	2155.4416524293606	3458.8717597513764	2562.1454896252753	1.5654879541645668	1.1546153238929284	0.73754340991342637	-0.4392	0.7375434099134263710	7862.5992674290019	6077.8929551332967	6978.9908562862229	6230.0414891364426	3.3062539492196406	2.8343219237170998	0.8572608055065073	-0.2222	0.857260805506507311	8414.5959658715055	5453.208730407142	7490.5049224896484	5688.4239200270968	3.1263497139051055	2.4903134798397306	0.79655627416329389	-0.3282	0.7965562741632938912	5963.8918162974396	9819.5091304716752	5212.2670775604693	9709.2914251520288	2.4898466084388513	4.6300890383786513	1.8595880656606969	0.8950	1.859588065660696913	3197.6659789462492	2144.2855606229232	2684.1715602285226	2558.7952652670319	1.4448031879968815	1.4264904870496482	0.98732512421112373	-0.0184	0.9873251242111237314	6530.5802149244992	7373.2716486484678	5737.4458741432445	7313.9719339611111	2.6709169609702559	3.2636781660339484	1.2219317237209661	0.2892	1.221931723720966115	2935.4904003907163	2001.3407231115523	2448.0368498163152	2405.8822360439749	1.1134052562312005	1.0372155970765202	0.93157059504768547	-0.1023	0.9315705950476854716	2253.2996929852347	1751.5012229708866	1848.3444256194523	2137.2109237881605	0.73282198936158749	0.85362709712693696	1.1648491850941742	0.2201	1.164849185094174217	657.7337788280596	441.80398342596527	511.21996392798752	620.85089657201354	0.29432898728944284	0.32098603721866936	1.0905688908684084	0.1251	1.090568890868408418	4427.4817927560243	2651.8287625193602	3794.3034081652181	3077.3433842019681	1.9634567142648558	1.5324432809458126	0.78048233496177677	-0.3576	0.7804823349617767719	2682.2184505518408	1801.7379590289599	2222.2804384795136	2191.0092728471277	1.0316658131431238	0.96991949550061274	0.94014891561212854	-0.0890	0.9401489156121285420	3142.513427213195	1817.454872551536	2633.5933201057624	2209.0953429996994	1.0889490261676305	0.8919385986206807	0.81908204809154916	-0.2879	0.81908204809154916!sample_table_end
