J Clin Invest, 1998)!Sample_characteristics_ch1 = Sex: M; VH status: unmut!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from B-CLL patients were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque (Seromed, Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany) density-gradient centrifugation and the proportion of CD5/CD19/CD23 triple positive B cells in the suspension was determined by direct immunofluorescence performed using a FACS-sort flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson & Co, Sunnyvale, CA) with antibodies to: CD19 FITC/PE, CD23 PE and CD5 Cy-Chrome (Becton Dickinson). If B-CLL cells were less than 90%, T cells, NK cells and monocytes were removed by negative selection using CD3, CD56, CD16, and CD14 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment (Becton Dickinson) followed by magnetic beads (Goat Anti-Mouse IgG Dynabeads, Dynal Biotech ASA, Oslo, Norway).!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA extraction was performed using WizardÂ® Genomic DNA Purification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Biotinylated DNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol starting from 250 nanograms of genomic DNA.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Following fragmentation, 40 micrograms of biotin-labeled DNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 48Â°C on GeneChip Human Mapping 50K XbaI Arrays. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.!Sample_scan_protocol = Human Mapping 50K XbaI arrays were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix).!Sample_description = Genome-wide profiling data from human B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient RC94!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Operating Software (GCOS version 1.4). Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 1 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Luca,,Agnelli!Sample_contact_email = luca.agnelli@unimi.it, katiatodoerti@gmail.com!Sample_contact_phone = +390255033328!Sample_contact_department = Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology - Hematology 1!Sample_contact_institute = University of Milan - Fondazione IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico!Sample_contact_address = Francesco Sforza, 35!Sample_contact_city = MILAN!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20122!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM278nnn/GSM278935/suppl/GSM278935.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE11036!Sample_series_id = GSE11038!Sample_data_row_count = 58613#ID_REF = #VALUE = HMM Median Log2 copy number - Genomic Bandwith Smoothing 1 Mb#LOC = Physical position!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	LOCSNP_A-1677174	0.25	836727SNP_A-1678466	0.01	2915399SNP_A-1676440	0.01	2926730SNP_A-1662392	0.01	2941104SNP_A-1685736	0.01	2941694SNP_A-1681384	0.01	2963436SNP_A-1642581	0.01	3116997SNP_A-1669029	0.01	3127559SNP_A-1718237	0.01	3178003SNP_A-1748467	0.01	3178365SNP_A-1705537	0.01	3671541SNP_A-1683756	0.01	3671691SNP_A-1696782	0.01	3754076SNP_A-1673422	0.01	3797248SNP_A-1670878	0.01	3966540SNP_A-1743511	0.01	3966641SNP_A-1736635	0.01	4073701SNP_A-1666738	0.01	4215064SNP_A-1721407	0.01	4242464SNP_A-1686722	0.01	4276892!sample_table_end
