DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to 250K_Sty!Sample_data_processing = CEL files and TXT files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by dChip and model-based expression performed using the PM/MM model. Normalization was performed using the invariant set probe selection method and the running median smoothing method. The data matrix contains the normalized expression values produced by that algorithm.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Pasi,,Janne!Sample_contact_email = pasi_janne@dfci.harvard.edu!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Dana-Farber Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 44 Binney Street Dana 820!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481167/suppl/GSM481167.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19388!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #Signal = Summarized signal#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal	VALUESNP_A-1855402	1553.61	BSNP_A-4249904	1863.01	BSNP_A-2174835	3278	ASNP_A-1880271	2979.23	BSNP_A-2313232	4819.19	BSNP_A-1790918	2471.58	ASNP_A-1812820	1993.57	ASNP_A-1825137	3762.29	ASNP_A-1855057	1130.31	BSNP_A-1855068	2592.06	ASNP_A-4249854	1548.83	BSNP_A-4249855	2366.96	ASNP_A-1855365	1643.81	BSNP_A-1856257	2688.3	ASNP_A-1862900	3588.33	BSNP_A-1894450	4282.99	BSNP_A-1900543	4055.32	ASNP_A-1905760	4420.87	ASNP_A-1907304	1090.46	BSNP_A-1941504	1947.88	B!sample_table_end
