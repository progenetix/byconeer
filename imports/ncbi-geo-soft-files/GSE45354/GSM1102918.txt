Two 1.5 mm diameter tissue-cylinders were punched and mounted into a recipient paraffin block. Samples were then heated at 37Â°C for 15 min to allow punches to coalesce into the encircling paraffin. Twenty to thirty 25 Î¼m thick sections were collected into a 2 ml eppendorf tube and deparaffinized twice for 15 min at 62Â°C in 1 ml xylene by vigorously mixing  (800 rpm), followed by two steps of 100% ethanol incubation, 15 min each. Samples were then pelleted and air-dry, suspended in 360 Î¼l of Qiagen ATL buffer supplemented with 40 Î¼l of Qiagen proteinase-K (600 mAU stock) and vigorously vortexed. Additional 40 Î¼l of proteinase-K were added after 24 and 48 h during a total 72-h incubation time at 56Â°C, with 500 rpm shacking. Proteinase-k was then inactivated at 90Â°C for 15 minutes and samples were subsequently processed according to Qiagen instruction (QIAamp DNA micro kit, cat. 51306, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) except that 80% ethanol was used in place of Qiagen AW2 buffer, to avoid excessive salts contamination. Finally, gDNA samples were eluted in 30 Î¼l of 37Â°C preheated DNase-free water and gDNA concentrations were measured using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE).!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Array CGH was performed using the Agilent Sureprint G3 8x60k kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), following the manufacturerâs protocol but with some modifications. Briefly, DNA was labeled with the Universal Linkage System (ULS) using cyanine-3 (Cy3) dye for the tumor test DNA and cyanine-5 (Cy5) dye for the reference DNA. Instead of the recommended 250 ng, 420 ng of each test sample were used for the labeling with 0.7 Î¼l of ULS-Cy3 whereas 300 ng of commercial reference DNA (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, cat. G1417 and G1521) were labeled with 0.5 Î¼l of ULS-Cy5. Before labeling, reference DNA was heat fragmented to achieve equal fragmented sized DNA in both test and reference samples. Labeled samples were then purified using the Agilent KREApure columns. Labeling efficiency was determined using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE) by measuring the absorbance at A260 nm (DNA), A550 nm (Cy3), and A649 nm (Cy5) and calculating the degree of labeling (DoL), according to Agilentâs instructions.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Human Genomic DNA: Female (Promega)!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = sample type: reference commercial DNA!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: F!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = reference commercial DNA purchased from Promega!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Array CGH was performed using the Agilent Sureprint G3 8x60k kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), following the manufacturerâs protocol but with some modifications.

DNA concentration was then recorded by measuring the intensities at 260 nm and 280 nm and equal amounts (250 ng) of test and reference ULS-labeled-DNA were combined as gender matched and hybridized on the Agilent 8x60k human CGH oligo microarray chip (Agilent-021924 SurePrint G3 Human CGH 8x60K Microarray, cat. G4450A). Test DNA was combined only with reference DNA having comparable degree of labeling. Hybridization was performed at 65Â°C for 40 h, 20 rpm.  Slides were then washed in Agilent Oligo aCGH Wash Buffer 1 at room temperature for 5 min followed by a 1 min wash with Agilent Oligo aCGH Wash Buffer 2 at 37Â°C. After washing steps, hybridized microarray slides were dried by using the stabilization and drying solution, and promptly protected with the Agilent Ozone-Barrier Slide Cover.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarray slides were scanned with an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2505C, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) at 3 Î¼m resolution with the manufacturerâs software (Agilent ScanControl 8.1.3).!Sample_description = genomic DNA extracted from FFPE primary cutaneous melanoma sample vs commercial genomic DNA, Promega!Sample_data_processing = The scanned microarray TIFF images were analyzed numerically using the Agilent Feature Extraction Software version 10.7.7.1 according to the Agilent standard protocol CGH_107_Sep09. Data quality and probe-to-probe noise of each array was estimated on the basis of the Derivative Log Ratio Spread (DLRS), according to Agilentâs indication, and Log2 ratio signal distributions.  Log2 ratio signal distributions were normalized adjusting the median value to 0.!Sample_platform_id = GPL10152!Sample_contact_name = Toma,,Tebaldi!Sample_contact_email = t.tebaldi@unitn.it!Sample_contact_department = Centre for Integrative Biology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Trento!Sample_contact_address = via Sommarive n. 9!Sample_contact_city = Povo!Sample_contact_state = Trento!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 38123!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1102nnn/GSM1102918/suppl/GSM1102918_S0816497.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE45354!Sample_data_row_count = 62976
