Fluorescence was measured using a TECAN (Salzburg, Austria) SpectrafluorPLUS microplate fluorescence reader with an excitation wavelength at 485 nm and an emission wavelength at 535 nm. DNA concentrations were calculated from a standard curve of double-stranded control DNA provided with the kit that was measured in triplicate at the concentrations 30, 3, 0.3, and 0.03 ng/Âµl (measured by fluorometry).A volume of 2.5 Âµl out of 4 ng/Âµl dilutions from cell lines and control DNA was used as starting material for the amplification. The phi29-amplification was carried out according to the Repli-G kit manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen) using an incubation time of 16 h. Repli-G reactions were checked by a real time based intra Alu-PCR assay. Additionally DNA concentration was fluorimetrically measured with Quant-iT Pico Green dsDNA Kit (Invitrogen) and ranged between 10-30 Å½Â¼g.!Sample_label_ch1 = cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 10 Âµg of amplified and purified DNA were labeled using the BioPrime Array CGH Genomic Labeling kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerÂ¢Ã¢Â¬Ã¢âÂ¢s instructions in a volume of 50 Âµl with a modified dNTP mix containing 120 ÂµM each of dATP, dGTP, and dCTP; 60 ÂµM dTTP; and 60 ÂµM Cy5-dUTP or Cy3-dUTP. Labeled DNA was purified using QIAquick PCR purification columns (Qiagen). Tumor and reference DNA were pooled, mixed with 50 Âµg Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen) and concentrated to a volume of 20 Âµl in a vacuum centrifuge. DNA was then mixed with an equal amount of 2x formamide buffer, denaturated at 95Â°C for 5 min and preincubated at 37Â°C for 30 min in a waterbath.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = LNCaP-CN4 2!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = male DNA!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = DNA was isolated using the QiAmp DNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and subsequently quantified by a fluorometric assay (Quant-iT Pico Green dsDNA Kit, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany).

After hybridization arrays and MAUI Mixer were disassembled in 42Â°C 1xSSC and 0.05% SDS (wash solution 1) and subsequently washed two times in wash solution 1 for 5 minutes followed by two washes in 0.1xSSC (wash solution 2) for 5 minutes.!Sample_scan_protocol = Dried array slides were scanned using a ScanLite Express microarray scanner (Perkin Elmer, Wellesley, MA, USA). Raw image files of the arrays were processed using DeArray software (Chen et al, 1997) and resulting image data were imported into R environment using bioconductor packages (Gentleman RC et al., 2004) for further analysis.!Sample_description = male DNA!Sample_data_processing = Loess normalization!Sample_platform_id = GPL5046!Sample_contact_name = Sean,,Davis!Sample_contact_email = sdavis2@mail.nih.gov!Sample_contact_phone = 301-435-2652!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genetics Branch!Sample_contact_institute = National Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 37 Convent Drive, Room 6138!Sample_contact_city = Bethesda!Sample_contact_state = MD!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20892!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM177nnn/GSM177482/suppl/GSM177482_Result.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE7376!Sample_data_row_count = 36288
