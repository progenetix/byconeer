Sample was hybridized for 20 hours followed by post-hybridisation washes and drying of slides by using an automated hybridisation station (Tecan Benelux BVBA).!Sample_scan_protocol = Slides were scanned on a GenePix 4100A scanner (Axon Instruments, Westburg BV).!Sample_description = Gender mismatch hybridisation!Sample_data_processing = Scanned images were processed using GenePix Pro 4.1 software. Pixel intensities for each feature were integrated and median values were determined, and the local background was calculated. For each spot the intensities were corrected (pixel median values) by subtracting the local background (pixel median values) for both wavelengths. The median of the ratios of all spots was calculated and used to normalize all data points. As quality control, spots outside the 20% confidence interval of the average of the replicate were excluded. Only those targets presenting at least two spots within 20% confidence interval of their average were used. For each feature (3 spots), the log2 value of the average of the normalized ratios of the three spots was calculated.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4012!Sample_contact_name = Marije,,Booman!Sample_contact_email = m.booman@path.umcg.nl!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = University Medical Center Groningen!Sample_contact_address = P.O.
