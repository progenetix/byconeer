Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481843/suppl/GSM481843_MR225.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5915	6316	5988.5304	6145.2894	1.183609	1.2209422	-0.0448	0.0225473530225	0.96942272	5664	6933	5746.2154	6735.2693	1.2286923	1.4320654	-0.2210	-0.000634853345346	0.85798623	10465	7025	10385.403	6823.8582	2.0790337	1.3451511	0.6281	0.19401062761	1.54557634	17445	15444	17011.126	15011.307	3.4957701	3.161992	0.1448	-0.00346004968022	1.10555945	18958	21363	18442.507	20834.995	4.0780854	4.4207286	-0.1164	-0.057852303925	0.92249176	11652	12514	11512.719	12143.48	2.4865034	2.5962703	-0.0623	-0.0608391971221	0.95772137	3472	3646	3604.0676	3540.6066	1.0490218	0.9176681	0.1930	0.129885031012	1.14313858	3159	3671	3297.097	3564.5733	0.6798946	0.7669797	-0.1739	-0.0288903783266	0.8864579	10085	8961	10020.631	8711.1084	2.071665	1.7608215	0.2345	0.207747075869	1.176533210	17377	14610	16946.649	14187.665	3.5023153	3.2210583	0.1208	0.164580991586	1.087318211	23506	20408	22688.046	19896.331	4.7393209	4.4929943	0.0770	0.0562593017141	1.054824612	13459	12458	13220.928	12089.552	3.4544287	2.9145728	0.2452	-0.0150020356582	1.185226413	8722	7487	8713.2105	7278.1467	2.2538509	1.8504883	0.2845	0.256197650865	1.217976314	16838	17972	16435.393	17513.481	3.4021969	3.5569444	-0.0642	0.00803991270817	0.956494315	5103	4920	5200.6434	4777.046	1.1822383	1.0618454	0.1549	0.222746703734	1.113380816	4648	5330	4753.3694	5178.8565	1.2492879	1.2314793	0.0207	0.0606278046143	1.014461117	5458	3095	5543.1247	3003.7793	1.1418754	0.6329438	0.8513	0.415648892071	1.804070718	6816	7438	6863.3177	7229.4527	1.4532162	1.4435381	0.0096	-0.0540947697754	1.006704519	7056	5322	7102.6091	5171.0292	1.5451047	1.1451687	0.4321	0.252117690907	1.349237620	4898	3484	5002.5452	3385.2885	0.8943612	0.7170807	0.3187	0.145028504035	1.2472253!sample_table_end
