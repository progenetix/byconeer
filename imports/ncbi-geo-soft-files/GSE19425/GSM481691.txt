Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481691/suppl/GSM481691_JBH091.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2339	2536	2319.0631	2525.3479	0.8642101	0.9695062	-0.1659	-0.00311672894471	0.8913922	2870	2646	2859.0422	2624.7733	1.2012669	1.1364249	0.0801	-0.164346515037	1.05705793	3220	3464	3216.7968	3351.6611	1.2867815	1.294332	-0.0084	-0.107297859604	0.99416644	6573	6904	6594.5933	6383.0369	2.5668829	2.5501976	0.0094	-0.223465634898	1.00654275	7443	9484	7449.6985	8672.7705	3.1186456	3.8172824	-0.2916	-0.28215049352	0.81698066	6648	7824	6668.6641	7197.9377	2.7402136	3.013343	-0.1371	-0.221503552645	0.909367	2563	2770	2546.8031	2738.7137	1.1229847	1.2814373	-0.1904	-0.284309209477	0.87634778	1939	1858	1911.603	1898.8733	0.8661346	0.800585	0.1135	-0.0399679433834	1.08187719	2149	2132	2131.3538	2158.4949	0.8781624	0.8919977	-0.0226	0.00670475808305	0.984489510	6854	7305	6872.0351	6734.9866	3.3832509	3.2079504	0.0768	0.115450538413	1.054645711	6995	7055	7011.3106	6514.9364	3.3095252	2.9286617	0.1764	0.0594570380251	1.130046912	4968	5084	4989.5521	4778.5314	2.2073508	2.0790405	0.0864	0.0221841307204	1.061716113	1890	2485	1861.0717	2479.7102	1.1004038	1.2750293	-0.2125	-0.00832812960375	0.86304214	4256	4424	4278.6262	4204.037	2.17681	2.136701	0.0268	-0.0716526920593	1.018771515	2429	2357	2410.7577	2367.6661	1.0165648	0.9648907	0.0753	0.154059617037	1.053554416	2013	1864	1989.8722	1904.4664	0.8254907	0.8076874	0.0315	0.1128043366	1.022042317	740	786	725.2756	846.7936	0.2938824	0.3534461	-0.2663	-0.181989947436	0.831477318	3140	3820	3134.5727	3670.3739	1.5792908	1.7943738	-0.1842	-0.169069250223	0.880134819	2415	2027	2396.4746	2057.6938	0.9576864	0.8510725	0.1703	0.154921193776	1.125270120	1385	1213	1365.1751	1280.4268	0.6517547	0.5990486	0.1217	-0.0196493054172	1.0879829!sample_table_end
