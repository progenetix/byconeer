Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481682/suppl/GSM481682_JA946.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	987	889	1001.4827	883.6031	0.9529571	0.8167311	-0.2226	0.0429897024719	0.85704922	880	1033	890.3414	1014.5149	1.0074877	1.1410576	0.1796	0.0406969260873	1.13257723	1208	1131	1240.1508	1106.7198	0.9964872	0.8793025	-0.1805	0.149903686092	0.88240214	4379	5398	4647.626	4996.5138	3.6075718	3.828834	0.0859	-0.0215592062268	1.06133275	5735	6237	6070.7297	5774.2867	5.4742478	5.1275323	-0.0944	-0.24125366841	0.93666426	3921	4825	4162.757	4465.2666	3.5331903	3.7371545	0.0810	0.0627077913497	1.0577287	1790	2057	1868.9438	1948.2206	1.3985882	1.5231167	0.1231	0.0567096199514	1.08903878	1508	1719	1560.9684	1640.3785	1.0445703	1.0784891	0.0461	-0.0921983397406	1.03247159	1072	979	1092.9267	965.3262	1.1711815	1.025212	-0.1920	-0.2766787721	0.875365510	3964	4606	4208.1446	4263.4373	2.515181	2.5311744	0.0091	-0.04523266666	1.006358711	6567	5328	6938.8846	4931.3892	4.2186353	3.020405	-0.4820	-0.219799440739	0.715967312	2882	3304	3054.1736	3069.5065	2.1656543	2.21119	0.0300	0.00644725925779	1.021026313	1432	1513	1480.4329	1450.686	1.0478028	1.0315388	-0.0226	-0.101157906563	0.98447814	1871	2096	1956.4931	1983.6792	2.551569	2.5498761	-0.0010	-0.146396739414	0.999336515	1845	1987	1928.3449	1884.62	1.2131717	1.1911348	-0.0264	0.0900354004587	0.981835316	1166	1286	1194.208	1249.0897	0.7975092	0.8595418	0.1081	0.0374667076871	1.077782917	471	473	466.9135	485.4224	0.5071286	0.5223373	0.0426	0.195097215457	1.029989718	1285	1310	1322.5228	1270.706	1.2830189	1.2135168	-0.0803	0.0561613395778	0.945829219	747	652	751.9348	660.9805	0.7756815	0.6764966	-0.1974	-0.00713719541314	0.872131820	1029	842	1046.8009	839.8397	0.5787995	0.4658214	-0.3133	0.00549657141539	0.804806!sample_table_end
