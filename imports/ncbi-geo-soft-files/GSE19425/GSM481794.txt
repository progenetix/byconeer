Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481794/suppl/GSM481794_MR032.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4061	4076	3902.3895	4208.859	1.1373392	1.1480773	0.0136	0.0449278702377	1.00944142	2282	2224	2123.5223	2382.1058	0.7735889	0.8061478	0.0595	0.170143761544	1.04208813	4598	4020	4440.1109	4153.0579	1.144433	1.0707664	-0.0960	0.0901976340994	0.93563054	16348	14169	15792.278	14088.443	4.5582141	3.9763454	-0.1970	-0.194837496003	0.87234725	30733	26960	29398.674	26173.719	8.0182159	7.6792279	-0.0623	-0.101896028463	0.95772286	12317	14079	11902.416	14001.981	3.3660278	3.9416	0.2277	0.330388478982	1.17099457	4805	5941	4642.4076	6044.1679	1.3110756	1.6989374	0.3739	0.359928620822	1.29583488	3851	3819	3694.5319	3952.0664	1.0369676	1.1441476	0.1419	-0.0247920976614	1.10335919	3428	3679	3278.3378	3811.5981	1.1587315	1.2333003	0.0900	0.0285882465636	1.064353810	16411	16607	15852.651	16431.867	4.815355	4.9314395	0.0344	0.0217908327259	1.024107111	11556	10753	11155.626	10790.751	3.1687674	3.0925853	-0.0351	-0.104712860574	0.975958512	9081	9692	8796.4771	9760.2873	2.1536097	2.679974	0.3155	0.18939609784	1.244410213	4781	4813	4619.0195	4948.363	1.4878254	1.5899097	0.0957	0.0295574840115	1.068613114	10556	10759	10193.966	10796.597	3.1685293	3.3432313	0.0774	0.0831531738409	1.055136615	2906	2573	2747.6149	2718.3845	0.7296266	0.7448943	0.0299	0.0380439175685	1.020925416	4766	4302	4604.4004	4435.8235	1.1945672	1.2000155	0.0066	-0.0581876776377	1.004560917	1514	1237	1332.4786	1426.1679	0.4528616	0.4513858	-0.0047	0.174685342436	0.996741118	9068	9571	8784.1204	9641.3065	2.3576501	2.6725803	0.1809	0.144937040413	1.13357819	2797	2942	2639.5472	3088.2573	0.9499595	0.9668029	0.0254	0.0141831591912	1.017730720	2864	2508	2706.2363	2653.8296	0.6829194	0.7186367	0.0735	0.0861490852624	1.0523009!sample_table_end
