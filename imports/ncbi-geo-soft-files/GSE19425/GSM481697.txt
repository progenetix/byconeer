Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481697/suppl/GSM481697_JBH097.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1125	898	1076.2745	950.8421	0.9295877	0.8018691	0.2132	0.0714260469447	1.1592762	1526	1594	1491.0022	1595.7539	1.1471201	1.2145783	-0.0824	-0.0428702626744	0.94445953	1085	976	1033.2638	1021.3097	0.8455451	0.8042576	0.0722	-0.0869848212342	1.05133624	3670	3377	3612.3675	3280.0266	3.1549286	2.86551	0.1388	-0.0446312606551	1.10100075	6479	6925	6294.9277	6698.0086	5.5137021	5.4457348	0.0179	-0.05666225896	1.01248086	3245	3928	3198.2414	3809.4686	2.6922292	3.1353136	-0.2198	-0.198171161794	0.85867947	918	1025	858.4319	1066.7786	0.8135478	0.9682434	-0.2511	-0.271249836999	0.84023068	1072	992	1019.4657	1036.1837	0.8698342	0.915652	-0.0741	-0.0753049116129	0.94996169	1810	1563	1778.4562	1566.5691	1.2644478	1.0895112	0.2148	0.258653871441	1.160564210	2873	2970	2836.5062	2889.4902	2.8122516	2.9548912	-0.0714	0.0378726198152	0.951727611	4590	4166	4499.6873	4037.7002	4.1010948	3.857449	0.0884	0.0108438457386	1.063162412	1768	1621	1737.7289	1621.031	1.637967	1.5502975	0.0794	-0.036399664226	1.0565513	1066	951	1013.1574	999.0526	1.1042333	1.1558775	-0.0659	0.0963845241565	0.955320314	2988	3623	2949.5236	3516.5897	2.6975177	2.8917135	-0.1003	-0.0319589844561	0.93284415	1401	1151	1360.3178	1184.9242	1.2533238	1.0991914	0.1893	0.175509016386	1.140223416	1017	994	961.7214	1038.0412	0.8477472	0.9112118	-0.1042	0.0633982913488	0.930351517	740	555	679.8467	632.6382	0.539385	0.5030098	0.1007	0.109668256952	1.07231518	1269	1599	1224.9074	1600.4366	1.0434969	1.2525855	-0.2635	-0.239927099741	0.833074319	1200	1070	1154.025	1109.1087	0.8302224	0.795782	0.0611	0.14690190579	1.043278620	798	468	736.8003	545.8324	0.7144174	0.5792135	0.3027	0.0711192842835	1.2334266!sample_table_end
