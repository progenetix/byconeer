Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481681/suppl/GSM481681_JA947.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2125	1583	2023.84	1651.636	1.1669132	0.9422409	0.3085	0.0429897024719	1.23844452	1452	1478	1396.3084	1539.9632	0.987579	1.0571525	-0.0982	0.0406969260873	0.93418783	3192	2165	3002.396	2263.7115	1.4776631	1.0592317	0.4803	0.149903686092	1.39503284	6483	6693	5998.6705	7058.9189	2.9746353	3.2528588	-0.1290	-0.0215592062268	0.9144685	11200	13067	10294.102	13769.174	4.8778458	6.3835343	-0.3881	-0.24125366841	0.76412936	6928	6148	6397.7853	6488.5902	3.3036522	3.2034247	0.0444	0.0627077913497	1.03128767	3164	2620	2976.6726	2747.4682	1.3245674	1.3334441	-0.0096	0.0567096199514	0.9933438	2297	2561	2181.7819	2685.7716	0.975825	1.1448773	-0.2305	-0.0921983397406	0.85234029	1519	1842	1459.3642	1922.1482	0.9812056	1.2604531	-0.3613	-0.2766787721	0.778454610	6199	5707	5739.4023	6027.107	2.5085615	2.6878831	-0.0996	-0.04523266666	0.933285111	10534	9095	9689.8197	9591.1518	4.3069896	4.1821489	0.0424	-0.219799440739	1.029850812	5746	4987	5331.0861	5265.3253	2.2430995	2.2698851	-0.0171	0.00644725925779	0.988199513	2734	2478	2580.156	2598.8863	1.0815909	1.2251018	-0.1797	-0.101157906563	0.882857914	3956	4238	3699.8102	4461.7718	2.6810371	3.2821181	-0.2918	-0.146396739414	0.816861815	3933	3064	3678.7493	3219.4546	1.4409076	1.2487286	0.2065	0.0900354004587	1.153899716	2102	1888	2002.4097	1970.8295	0.7968044	0.8153157	-0.0331	0.0374667076871	0.977295517	1145	827	1111.169	873.231	0.7367563	0.5790239	0.3476	0.195097215457	1.272410918	3053	2366	2874.796	2480.4091	1.5541407	1.3598487	0.1927	0.0561613395778	1.142877619	1491	1222	1433.0195	1275.8254	0.9572018	0.843107	0.1831	-0.00713719541314	1.135326620	1160	862	1125.263	909.0442	0.504516	0.4029553	0.3243	0.00549657141539	1.2520395!sample_table_end
