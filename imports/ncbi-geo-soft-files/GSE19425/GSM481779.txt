Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481779/suppl/GSM481779_JBH555.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	800	1049	938.99307	891.55942	1.5656006	1.3482357	0.2156	0.0951143935703	1.16122172	365	660	434.98339	560.95082	0.9058476	1.0186142	-0.1693	0.0675701596997	0.88929413	427	714	509.50659	607.17022	0.5522894	0.6107034	-0.1450	0.00282304293116	0.90434974	2938	2349	3196.991	2047.134	3.1502569	2.1620825	0.5430	0.062620074194	1.45704755	6012	9209	6278.554	8588.029	6.916071	9.086826	-0.3938	-0.0433128343032	0.76110976	2330	2989	2571.3631	2623.9536	3.1095685	2.9418012	0.0800	0.05232059244	1.05702887	962	1342	1117.8395	1144.9247	0.9725949	0.9895161	-0.0249	-0.103623265553	0.98289958	923	1055	1074.7308	896.76923	0.7821174	0.7500779	0.0603	-0.0974636744812	1.04271499	765	1203	898.80569	1025.7275	1.7648742	1.7200928	0.0371	-0.0014235456514	1.026034310	5534	6510	5811.4166	5934.135	3.6784434	4.3875609	-0.2543	0.0161660953515	0.8383811	7587	7404	7787.1473	6804.1422	5.2961766	5.6004164	-0.0806	-0.0746773033623	0.945675512	2423	2174	2665.135	1889.3312	1.6862982	1.3524372	0.3183	0.0456506927086	1.246858713	1402	2231	1597.7319	1940.4364	0.9792026	1.3356231	-0.4478	-0.0894889776361	0.733142914	690	1170	812.02341	997.12937	2.1470787	2.0468855	0.0689	0.0984791185768	1.048949115	1214	1576	1395.0392	1354.2748	0.8624071	0.9794893	-0.1837	0.0343256039391	0.880466116	915	1658	1065.8771	1426.8814	0.6786562	0.9096946	-0.4227	-0.044052208241	0.746026417	135	247	139.77292	226.16971	0.2773267	0.4072698	-0.5544	-0.328670118963	0.68094118	1014	1613	1175.2865	1387.1271	1.6828698	1.8222441	-0.1148	-0.0263855213521	0.92351519	310	541	369.31104	460.9811	0.6281664	0.7157575	-0.1883	0.0197066107541	0.877624620	1012	1066	1173.0794	906.32303	0.8163574	0.6756288	0.2730	0.0347721163721	1.2082927!sample_table_end
