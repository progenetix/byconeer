Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481834/suppl/GSM481834_MR158.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4807	5472	4877.5916	5352.5027	1.3683725	1.3544345	-0.0148	0.0317981629227	0.98981422	3754	4078	3852.8556	3995.8083	1.0506378	1.0107836	-0.0558	-0.122609247752	0.96206663	5012	5005	5079.3325	4888.7683	1.4070605	1.2555318	-0.1644	0.00735253846659	0.89230834	10283	8053	10098.829	7826.8233	2.647784	1.9832508	-0.4169	-0.261181882642	0.74902295	12358	11381	12065.203	11038.432	3.4537602	2.8329336	-0.2859	-0.203129280984	0.82024626	7314	8895	7282.4097	8623.1711	2.2429988	2.3647485	0.0763	0.0262215908423	1.05427997	3030	3202	3137.7131	3141.324	0.7451474	0.7375553	-0.0148	-0.0222813147828	0.98981148	3121	3573	3230.2155	3498.1394	0.7535012	0.8394724	0.1559	0.105899828286	1.11409559	7522	8348	7486.7698	8103.8645	1.8520545	1.8948542	0.0330	0.0101579497125	1.023109310	17720	16240	17180.374	15824.012	3.6087932	3.801943	0.0752	0.00730445306484	1.05352211	22759	21741	21894.586	21390.54	4.7764607	5.2047593	0.1239	0.0859785121871	1.089668612	8674	8545	8591.5843	8291.1541	1.8103852	1.8633588	0.0416	-0.0446692355231	1.02926113	13855	12511	13483.256	12138.35	2.3634045	2.5054199	0.0842	-0.00310824203481	1.060089314	9892	10636	9723.1164	10309.271	3.0004527	2.7283215	-0.1372	-0.126498378685	0.909303315	6415	6536	6435.143	6375.5904	1.2973587	1.387356	0.0968	0.0893445173319	1.069369616	5701	6098	5743.7828	5950.5582	1.2407394	1.3513196	0.1232	0.00442516558603	1.089124517	2375	2763	2483.652	2708.7499	0.688409	0.6977741	0.0195	0.0525579307112	1.01360418	5163	6330	5228.0185	6178.2202	1.645589	1.591832	-0.0479	-0.16518641189	0.967332719	5418	6031	5472.1592	5884.8172	1.3997066	1.4494024	0.0503	0.0290298923867	1.035504520	3722	3145	3821.7679	3085.549	0.8141775	0.7459313	-0.1263	-0.103187791128	0.9161778!sample_table_end
