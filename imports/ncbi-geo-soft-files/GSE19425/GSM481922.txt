Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481922/suppl/GSM481922_MR346.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2977	1918	2766.6267	2089.5338	1.3730649	1.0152597	-0.4356	0.0140842979732	0.73941132	1671	1453	1503.5771	1616.0931	0.8635065	0.9529077	0.1421	0.111024900397	1.10353283	3220	2188	2999.6227	2365.3246	1.1799057	0.9016184	-0.3881	0.0063054932169	0.76414444	13315	9661	12422.021	9945.5901	4.3649572	3.4547899	-0.3374	-0.273142509594	0.79148315	16191	13624	15016.605	14056.609	6.9325813	6.1739317	-0.1672	-0.176792216568	0.89056756	9839	9333	9247.3163	9604.0575	4.0378853	4.0877702	0.0177	0.09987378241	1.01235427	2528	2255	2326.0402	2432.4024	1.2914139	1.2948613	0.0038	0.132904364711	1.00266958	3557	2877	3315.7642	3047.3743	1.0533856	0.9783167	-0.1067	0.00503601617089	0.92873579	3371	2181	3139.9642	2358.3062	1.6237475	1.2714869	-0.3528	-0.163580952085	0.78305710	12239	10733	11437.919	11053.422	4.1137939	4.109931	-0.0014	0.0671283145277	0.99906111	9543	5233	8973.3175	5419.6107	3.2491944	2.0308117	-0.6780	-0.533842741295	0.625020112	6915	7127	6524.4183	7348.7995	2.884288	3.1785018	0.1401	-0.26849309221	1.102005713	3192	2514	2973.0327	2687.2627	1.2789932	1.1360169	-0.1710	0.0347702855307	0.888211814	8676	7052	8178.2032	7272.3671	5.0198354	4.4589796	-0.1709	-0.217387610083	0.888272115	2354	1789	2163.2605	1956.9578	0.8466361	0.734236	-0.2055	0.0118163452117	0.867239116	1925	1729	1749.264	1896.7892	0.7927997	0.8374716	0.0791	-0.170232694379	1.05634717	1136	713	1001.0053	849.6041	0.6133774	0.5230608	-0.2298	0.24368053475	0.852755218	4108	3833	3856.1272	4012.5226	1.9553073	1.9303054	-0.0186	0.0275593366621	0.987213319	1813	1237	1640.9285	1395.6168	0.9062836	0.7924158	-0.1937	-0.0429657993272	0.874357520	3746	2632	3498.5431	2803.4064	0.9791711	0.8590596	-0.1888	-0.131557138703	0.8773335!sample_table_end
