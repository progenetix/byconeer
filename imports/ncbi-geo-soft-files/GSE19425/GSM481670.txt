Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481670/suppl/GSM481670_JA920.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3415	2539	3203.2413	2650.927	1.4974439	1.249	-0.2617	-0.0176954412263	0.83408792	2310	1972	2179.3291	2062.2732	0.8827026	0.8300877	-0.0887	0.0656251106466	0.94039343	1974	1597	1866.5543	1678.801	1.1716352	1.0625327	-0.1410	-0.116303180319	0.90688014	4146	2210	3880.3012	2310.9044	2.5023553	1.4793867	-0.7583	-0.464668906406	0.59119775	5779	3028	5390.0501	3163.7463	4.3327986	2.4994771	-0.7937	-0.553857072445	0.57687356	4870	4171	4548.883	4345.5074	2.8577106	2.7240695	-0.0691	-0.0208624881337	0.95323497	761	660	721.0294	708.0676	0.8303055	0.8875339	0.0962	0.272186386574	1.06892448	1154	1109	1097.4126	1168.1256	0.7872825	0.8217371	0.0618	-0.0046339986394	1.0437649	3806	3513	3567.0591	3668.7326	1.3359118	1.3629373	0.0289	-0.0915199763524	1.0202310	3255	3223	3053.4077	3367.89	2.5735674	2.7591573	0.1005	-0.325012951189	1.072113811	10920	8194	10170.476	8520.0507	8.4787938	7.2009177	-0.2357	-0.128303450815	0.849285612	1369	964	1299.2665	1021.0205	1.4252388	1.1434948	-0.3178	-0.271705612504	0.80231813	1458	1421	1384.4437	1494.3653	1.7972603	1.9540647	0.1207	-0.194760894143	1.087246314	8582	6666	7990.2411	6945.3793	3.2091227	2.692264	-0.2534	-0.152708808017	0.838940815	1836	1728	1738.4508	1810.9994	1.6849032	1.7725364	0.0731	-0.0364907930677	1.052010816	902	833	856.3702	887.1981	0.9163156	1.0011651	0.1278	-0.106901343013	1.092598417	2247	1947	2119.7043	2036.1798	0.8717417	0.8264981	-0.0769	-0.113765106717	0.948099718	2412	2471	2276.2328	2580.8487	1.3399563	1.4971088	0.1600	-0.068196767478	1.117281819	3560	3423	3338.8744	3576.1126	1.4152664	1.4986596	0.0826	-0.0682524598837	1.05892420	901	765	855.4119	816.7186	0.5080899	0.4709382	-0.1095	-0.00975196108515	0.9268797!sample_table_end
