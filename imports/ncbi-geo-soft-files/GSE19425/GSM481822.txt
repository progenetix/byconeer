Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481822/suppl/GSM481822_MR080.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4781	7072	5098.629	6704.4058	1.1367739	1.3911185	0.2913	0.271705103961	1.22374252	3389	4017	3723.8103	3783.0182	0.88648	0.8076244	-0.1344	-0.0906209138713	0.91104633	4669	4381	4988.8479	4117.1993	0.9823878	0.8226114	-0.2561	-0.16886073204	0.8373594	13127	11285	12470.627	10819.892	2.4878324	2.1432689	-0.2151	-0.18565899682	0.86150055	21327	14972	19494.204	14381.336	3.7303231	2.7962774	-0.4158	-0.286374298321	0.74960736	12472	9775	11907.616	9300.8162	2.5622019	1.9804446	-0.3716	-0.236371990765	0.77294637	5259	3732	5554.7721	3516.6769	0.982542	0.697172	-0.4950	-0.318013589902	0.70955958	4514	5522	4839.3569	5187.0171	0.8884512	0.9319322	0.0689	0.0742537305717	1.04894029	6912	10107	7087.8242	9633.09	1.645408	2.0246831	0.2993	0.330576985724	1.230505110	14872	16287	13917.563	15681.221	2.5850468	2.8514703	0.1415	0.0735777304862	1.103063311	20669	14861	18927.452	14272.264	3.433012	2.5836142	-0.4101	-0.37488799599	0.752579412	9729	8162	9551.1722	7738.5896	1.6944915	1.5380542	-0.1397	-0.351240691286	0.907678913	8442	8452	8433.0288	8027.0775	1.4879425	1.5180897	0.0289	0.0485425514103	1.02026114	12596	11074	12014.212	10605.821	2.888383	2.3287853	-0.3107	-0.204459463406	0.806259215	5614	6436	5880.4694	6066.7941	0.9773373	1.1915131	0.2859	0.231192144081	1.219142116	5376	6520	5664.3248	6152.203	0.9895017	1.2025425	0.2813	0.0598875366593	1.21530117	2135	2737	2404.9067	2625.0887	0.5725144	0.5717495	-0.0019	-0.0133125161485	0.99866418	7117	7372	7265.8992	6981.5854	1.3878319	1.2713346	-0.1265	-0.164135315893	0.91605819	4090	5762	4434.0345	5416.8256	1.0820777	1.2103017	0.1616	0.142005438967	1.118497920	4220	6070	4562.9734	5711.3972	0.8260394	0.97204	0.2348	0.168947613238	1.1767477!sample_table_end
