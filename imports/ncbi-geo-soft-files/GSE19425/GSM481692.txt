Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481692/suppl/GSM481692_JBH092.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2547	3573	2770.1605	3322.7568	0.9284419	1.0370734	0.1596	-0.00311672894471	1.11700412	3488	3536	3681.5956	3287.4767	1.4152382	1.0660665	-0.4087	-0.164346515037	0.7532773	4270	4037	4408.3904	3772.8939	1.4101961	1.2224207	-0.2062	-0.107297859604	0.86684444	13585	8798	12342.76	8644.2495	3.454635	2.5178523	-0.4563	-0.223465634898	0.7288335	15399	11820	13823.434	11748.019	4.8582155	4.0215503	-0.2727	-0.28215049352	0.82778346	9482	7630	8949.3881	7426.5239	3.2022021	2.5903262	-0.3059	-0.221503552645	0.80892027	4394	3539	4523.0837	3290.3278	1.5721846	1.2096393	-0.3782	-0.284309209477	0.76940028	2909	2776	3129.1965	2555.1573	0.8616704	0.7535293	-0.1935	-0.0399679433834	0.87449839	2798	3927	3018.4475	3665.1516	1.0651322	1.0920161	0.0360	0.00670475808305	1.025239910	9960	9820	9352.3777	9704.9404	2.6749151	2.9765389	0.1541	0.115450538413	1.112760111	16222	12261	14498.14	12211.01	3.9044636	3.7519897	-0.0575	0.0594570380251	0.960948812	7259	6618	7063.2422	6385.7524	2.0275674	1.9693507	-0.0420	0.0221841307204	0.971287413	3775	4675	3946.7068	4424.7877	1.242466	1.4231103	0.1958	-0.00832812960375	1.145391714	5767	6796	5751.7584	6571.6529	3.1030518	2.7578651	-0.1701	-0.0716526920593	0.888758915	4801	5485	4893.7408	5229.0307	1.2582713	1.4786673	0.2329	0.154059617037	1.175157716	2370	3032	2590.7411	2799.5431	0.7436421	0.8507658	0.1942	0.1128043366	1.144052717	835	1103	966.8068	1028.7517	0.359482	0.3359371	-0.0977	-0.181989947436	0.93450318	3558	4031	3747.7231	3766.9833	1.7435778	1.5671202	-0.1539	-0.169069250223	0.898795619	1757	2616	1966.1362	2398.9133	0.6899058	0.7599848	0.1396	0.154921193776	1.101577620	2031	2158	2249.805	1972.0214	0.6523986	0.5835269	-0.1610	-0.0196493054172	0.8944331!sample_table_end
