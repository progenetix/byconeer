Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481744/suppl/GSM481744_JBH500.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6674	5728	6307.5172	5953.9812	1.5349701	1.3668509	-0.1674	-0.0375324439889	0.8904742	5898	4713	5587.202	4918.9421	1.4608472	1.1922902	-0.2931	-0.210883524459	0.81616363	5879	4381	5569.7682	4573.0846	1.175646	0.9736235	-0.2720	-0.28696355948	0.82816044	13856	7059	12921.712	7316.9806	2.7063318	1.5418173	-0.8117	-0.577890064299	0.56970745	23563	13444	21918.257	13790.371	4.6685738	3.0058974	-0.6352	-0.59730949295	0.64385776	11046	8484	10362.677	8753.1294	2.3928582	2.0162064	-0.2471	-0.394164295578	0.84259337	3435	3115	3286.5238	3282.4423	0.7787045	0.7619075	-0.0315	-0.260385235377	0.97842958	3908	2933	3739.3833	3094.9826	0.7429007	0.6372034	-0.2214	-0.428945928011	0.85772359	8513	7985	8021.0321	8241.5439	1.9496663	1.8569071	-0.0703	-0.131269338228	0.95242310	18321	15429	17045.684	15822.669	3.7550786	3.6462325	-0.0424	-0.151595525552	0.971013611	34641	19145	32218.98	19660.012	6.7298869	4.3653744	-0.6245	-1.07968748939	0.64865512	13844	8132	12910.638	8391.312	2.9579141	1.9166157	-0.6260	-0.561547449322	0.647961913	8349	6693	7868.1871	6947.8504	1.8911337	1.7069385	-0.1478	-0.299214822176	0.902600614	13889	10310	12952.211	10611.993	3.7348184	2.7486605	-0.4423	-0.47919360696	0.735955615	5330	4746	5075.5992	4953.7221	1.0856522	1.0715207	-0.0189	-0.115289684063	0.986983416	6238	5269	5904.4364	5491.6699	1.324732	1.2081534	-0.1329	-0.30459186183	0.911998317	1687	1779	1647.164	1903.5703	0.4222999	0.461666	0.1286	0.107922965935	1.093218218	7860	6065	7411.7434	6296.5188	1.673159	1.3717309	-0.2866	-0.491978077455	0.81984519	4341	4066	4146.6505	4260.198	1.054586	1.0118304	-0.0597	-0.0725833818766	0.959457420	3982	2792	3810.515	2949.2424	0.7620668	0.6354821	-0.2621	-0.220425001678	0.8338929!sample_table_end
