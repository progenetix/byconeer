Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481914/suppl/GSM481914_MR328.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	7600	6335	7322.4464	6528.3892	1.5293654	1.3883232	-0.1396	0.200874050822	0.90777732	6010	5117	5814.8538	5258.7463	1.402873	1.2988363	-0.1112	-0.00817175871582	0.92584023	5633	4137	5455.7087	4248.3308	1.1495319	0.8976301	-0.3569	-0.00745899649291	0.78086584	29865	26217	27940.034	27261.327	5.4328625	5.3466848	-0.0231	-0.120556404635	0.98413775	25055	23550	23527.979	24467.304	5.6353795	5.6107856	-0.0063	-0.151558843838	0.99563586	12421	11091	11847.626	11493.291	2.7333169	2.608752	-0.0673	0.0133206096791	0.95442727	3110	3000	3044.844	3069.287	0.8419274	0.7838567	-0.1031	-0.107825256599	0.93102648	4695	4407	4559.2587	4527.4166	0.8843976	0.9014924	0.0276	-0.0102536768192	1.01932939	4583	4104	4453.7795	4214.0561	0.99814	0.9703116	-0.0408	-0.0231964441889	0.972119810	12605	10470	12016.056	10838.751	2.7620192	2.5734627	-0.1020	-0.0691758422429	0.931732311	19891	17323	18762.542	18019.874	3.9839306	3.9984782	0.0053	-0.0867655271584	1.003651512	16552	14533	15671.503	15105.499	3.6610648	3.4989647	-0.0653	-0.217118526698	0.955723213	5383	5929	5218.5788	6108.723	1.2320394	1.4502054	0.2352	-0.0323650382712	1.177077114	15574	16461	14770.589	17118.846	4.0472164	4.5636027	0.1732	-0.100853254652	1.127590415	4906	4726	4759.2299	4853.9814	1.0505673	1.0757209	0.0341	0.07026717454	1.023942816	3486	4275	3407.9991	4391.6812	0.8027718	0.9999345	0.3168	-0.0760594848904	1.245602317	2134	1768	2117.9806	1801.0356	0.5133861	0.4476384	-0.1977	0.120182443604	0.871933218	6675	6034	6449.2552	6217.0226	1.6109553	1.4343538	-0.1675	-0.0177995347772	0.890374719	3822	3297	3731.0763	3378.8216	0.769037	0.7322101	-0.0708	-0.0215889048918	0.952112920	4017	3392	3917.861	3478.8601	0.650964	0.617002	-0.0773	-0.100998663797	0.9478282!sample_table_end
