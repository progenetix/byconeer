Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481481/suppl/GSM481481_DE390.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3856	3190	3656.8072	3270.0694	1.3914594	1.4593452	-0.0687	-0.152157373884	0.9534822	1277	1228	1272.2302	1247.5433	0.8065081	0.766786	0.0729	0.0520577496973	1.05180333	5217	3372	4876.5497	3457.8992	1.3350576	1.1861613	0.1706	-0.162633192592	1.12552794	6124	5708	5695.0204	5881.7425	2.0441476	2.3066321	-0.1743	0.0192206749344	0.88620445	11267	10036	10229.132	10440.348	3.4734294	4.0682559	-0.2280	-0.0383390991638	0.85378836	11893	9645	10765.814	10021.749	3.2603773	3.6919965	-0.1794	-0.0453270497936	0.88309337	1363	1717	1352.9226	1741.5264	0.9775875	1.2138502	-0.3123	-0.287520396946	0.80536098	1768	1901	1741.2026	1922.1904	0.796467	0.8559364	-0.1039	-0.189620882076	0.93052119	1610	1973	1591.7922	1994.3605	1.0007031	1.2204265	-0.2864	-0.0354599628865	0.819961810	7795	8998	7184.9755	9336.9514	4.9118977	5.1855463	-0.0782	-0.0833099365602	0.947228611	8218	11103	7558.9361	11583.036	4.2744294	5.7756722	-0.4343	-0.319436117146	0.740074812	1813	2505	1782.8748	2546.2554	1.3231403	1.6757652	-0.3409	-0.244764942104	0.789573813	1514	2303	1499.0492	2339.0623	1.7604373	2.0601553	-0.2268	-0.100963927039	0.854516814	3526	3749	3356.6704	3844.4871	1.8103284	2.2341688	-0.3035	-0.0452206831234	0.810291715	1881	1904	1845.6442	1925.1321	1.1717578	1.1156488	0.0708	-0.139883280545	1.050292716	2075	2335	2025.8347	2371.8674	1.4634775	1.5179136	-0.0527	-0.137803219949	0.964137617	1106	1039	1106.9346	1058.6591	0.6058336	0.5835408	0.0541	-0.196965429441	1.038202618	4625	5092	4341.6302	5239.2336	1.517022	2.024114	-0.4160	-0.31771911848	0.749474619	2107	2452	2055.0718	2490.9152	1.292702	1.4607268	-0.1763	-0.191606974897	0.884971820	959	1150	964.7151	1171.0691	0.7777769	0.7632003	0.0273	-0.206134423727	1.0190994!sample_table_end
