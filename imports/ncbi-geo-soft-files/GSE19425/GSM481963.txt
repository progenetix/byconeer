Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481963/suppl/GSM481963_MR393.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4027	4647	3799.0525	4894.9964	1.0960098	1.4008	-0.3540	-0.142979630197	0.7824172	4007	4024	3784.3605	4158.9159	1.179645	1.3132345	-0.1548	0.157359645172	0.89827443	3340	2444	3259.2378	2377.5156	0.9885892	0.7092788	0.4790	0.0514378133303	1.39379484	10326	9791	8674.8385	10609.342	2.6734541	3.2426689	-0.2785	-0.0494649957191	0.8244615	14362	12762	11827.937	13577.788	3.5715518	3.9874204	-0.1589	-0.0831678123107	0.89570486	7650	5990	6606.692	6419.8616	2.1412843	2.0340753	0.0741	-0.0487899363776	1.05270647	2317	2137	2437.8935	2056.6118	0.8132906	0.6625583	0.2957	0.13924197267	1.22750048	2283	4050	2407.7879	4189.6484	0.7716294	1.3302717	-0.7857	-0.371352033201	0.58005399	2411	3774	2517.1163	3866.0286	0.749873	1.166061	-0.6369	-0.21652951595	0.643082110	8752	6186	7460.612	6639.2707	2.9313101	2.8513414	0.0399	0.114315580128	1.02804611	12504	10835	10366.107	11682.325	3.8604752	4.7391002	-0.2958	-0.49022802023	0.814600812	11166	10684	9333.4081	11528.012	3.1721163	3.9419373	-0.3135	-0.127029660435	0.804709913	3940	3677	3735.028	3754.0332	1.4360621	1.5874235	-0.1446	-0.0974696016343	0.904649614	11664	12925	9722.7548	13733.804	3.0472445	4.2965594	-0.4957	-0.199419812916	0.70922915	3703	3534	3556.9565	3596.4007	1.1221647	1.1743682	-0.0656	-0.0281677795825	0.955547616	2262	4267	2389.1586	4446.5392	0.7799424	1.4503323	-0.8949	-0.264999609441	0.53776817	971	961	1128.5818	946.4534	0.3569524	0.3072699	0.2162	0.0253109254419	1.161689918	4381	5668	4068.8522	6055.5571	1.2409363	1.7797854	-0.5203	-0.355151152889	0.697239319	2267	3137	2393.5955	3153.8534	0.8066312	1.1265775	-0.4820	-0.120579429398	0.716001420	1361	2445	1550.4117	2378.586	0.6055298	0.9344897	-0.6260	-0.31580789164	0.647979!sample_table_end
