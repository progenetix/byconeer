Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481859/suppl/GSM481859_MR255.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	7239	6252	6702.8651	6543.4797	1.7891415	1.8422685	-0.0422	-0.193504339136	0.97116212	5858	5065	5477.4587	5320.8312	1.4347115	1.4897981	-0.0544	-0.097046396197	0.96302413	3471	2942	3289.9137	3115.9626	0.9399344	0.9522661	-0.0188	-0.223664963337	0.98705014	12547	8247	11371.671	8634.4944	3.4763791	2.8319357	0.2958	-0.00982375895985	1.22756285	17720	11519	15966.201	12008.518	4.5348144	3.6407408	0.3168	0.229710592745	1.24557466	8905	5591	8176.2224	5871.6209	2.3833431	1.8630638	0.3553	0.384769869077	1.279267	2998	2358	2842.6548	2514.8512	0.6911603	0.5874752	0.2345	0.301207169752	1.17649278	2783	2502	2636.7344	2663.7566	0.845044	0.8901538	-0.0750	0.0634677373565	0.94932369	5168	5585	4850.7467	5865.5149	1.2155036	1.5394607	-0.3409	-0.322074535866	0.789564510	9336	8721	8560.8643	9124.2194	3.5156258	3.4709088	0.0185	0.0238070554695	1.012883311	9480	12034	8689.2537	12536.784	3.2515473	4.3995805	-0.4362	-0.51228508083	0.739058412	12087	9818	10964.695	10246.736	2.7522351	2.5123694	0.1316	-0.057407487082	1.095473913	4469	5454	4217.7712	5732.1108	1.4867767	1.6940718	-0.1883	-0.171362065919	0.87763514	14795	12385	13357.077	12895.035	3.5288697	3.6106971	-0.0331	-0.0257201888731	0.977337515	3156	3867	2994.2181	4065.2179	0.9093771	1.0508125	-0.2086	-0.266759638966	0.865403816	3964	5070	3731.5958	5326.106	0.9169138	1.182733	-0.3673	-0.211580805457	0.7752517	856	684	796.1018	790.1197	0.2158531	0.2293399	-0.0874	-0.14469508376	0.941192818	5346	5868	5015.4477	6153.2533	1.2486641	1.6063074	-0.3634	-0.276726100185	0.777350619	3052	2619	2895.0357	2783.8605	0.8102242	0.8335363	-0.0409	-0.0758184741957	0.972032320	2909	2503	2756.3637	2664.7869	0.895462	0.9423308	-0.0736	-0.0994149456375	0.9502628!sample_table_end
