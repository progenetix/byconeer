Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481572/suppl/GSM481572_EL634.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1827	1197	1679.1236	1312.1332	1.053797	0.8779228	-0.2634	0.00703213026824	0.83310432	1544	1782	1408.2774	1907.4664	1.2411255	1.4607314	0.2350	0.202615688695	1.17694083	1486	1299	1353.9972	1413.9025	0.9402468	0.8638533	-0.1223	-0.157373297136	0.91875154	9039	7239	8389.1676	7484.1428	5.1874564	4.8932954	-0.0842	-0.0146114339019	0.94329385	8819	12403	8189.8638	12868.61	4.4195392	6.8051208	0.6227	0.0841482380842	1.53978066	7604	8098	7078.6238	8370.8584	5.4587088	5.8292319	0.0947	0.121665561666	1.06787747	1985	2281	1830.5173	2418.4304	0.9450622	1.0576973	0.1624	-0.105997599939	1.11918288	1378	1127	1250.4014	1241.3376	0.8887416	0.8255967	-0.1063	0.0181542878601	0.92895039	2098	1948	1942.1166	2079.5184	1.7822942	1.6280203	-0.1306	0.0141804448841	0.913440810	7331	6681	6830.8185	6912.7487	5.0555617	5.137132	0.0231	-0.0131296745692	1.016134711	2805	1702	2604.136	1825.7159	2.2056534	1.5851945	-0.4765	-0.503921111067	0.71869612	4885	4369	4561.3592	4541.683	3.4499319	3.0389608	-0.1830	-0.128254552699	0.880875513	1819	1320	1671.5217	1435.062	1.2650328	0.986979	-0.3581	-0.0887447320721	0.780200314	3087	2310	2870.9891	2447.4994	2.1034286	1.820469	-0.2084	-0.0544033829913	0.865476915	1388	1144	1260.251	1258.7304	0.9729008	0.8347224	-0.2210	-0.0481479938903	0.857972816	1593	1486	1454.3749	1607.7819	1.146954	1.1883301	0.0511	-0.181896677089	1.036074717	554	430	459.9347	521.4875	0.3731112	0.3896043	0.0624	0.179219679256	1.04420418	5431	3817	5074.3166	3970.4603	2.1333812	1.9372887	-0.1391	-0.021670125369	0.908083719	913	534	806.6137	630.5439	0.7763459	0.6122375	-0.3426	-0.110652127326	0.788614320	2244	1352	2082.8797	1467.873	1.3351004	1.0579534	-0.3357	-0.103921122864	0.7924148!sample_table_end
