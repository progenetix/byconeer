Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481508/suppl/GSM481508_DE425.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2825	2087	2443.3272	2430.385	0.851352	0.7545414	-0.1742	0.0155506632497	0.8862862	2393	1727	2059.5687	2019.0609	0.7898587	0.7859438	-0.0072	-0.0151683774146	0.99504353	4144	3458	3609.5712	3936.5537	1.0786778	1.0899568	0.0150	0.232595312203	1.01045634	8885	6263	7964.1545	6835.3801	2.5186578	2.2507028	-0.1623	-0.276252365037	0.89361195	21396	13953	18604.426	14408.23	5.1573556	4.0833793	-0.3369	-0.304444084569	0.79175836	13635	8472	12183	9015.4425	3.7620448	2.6482499	-0.5065	-0.558285325284	0.70393897	4298	2444	3746.8261	2831.6466	1.2081609	0.9339186	-0.3714	-0.425349001226	0.77300848	2683	1783	2317.3773	2083.43	0.7376898	0.6693648	-0.1402	-0.141284655063	0.90737969	3608	2627	3121.5394	3031.4493	1.1267821	1.12098	-0.0074	0.0671721057867	0.994850710	11710	6588	10521.972	7156.5954	4.3374362	2.9361496	-0.5629	-0.298554971662	0.67693211	18019	9121	15863.857	9654.602	5.9645583	3.7417836	-0.6727	-0.437438892928	0.627336212	9186	7929	8238.1335	8483.4922	3.0923466	2.975446	-0.0556	-0.195595295771	0.962196813	5327	3469	4674.4655	3948.352	2.159334	1.7511262	-0.3023	-0.0610003890328	0.810956614	10646	7836	9577.4962	8392.2323	3.3822741	2.9908847	-0.1774	-0.180866734563	0.884282115	4007	2362	3484.1625	2739.0754	1.3081375	0.9795823	-0.4173	-0.070613710387	0.748837316	3688	2631	3192.8625	3035.7426	1.2443209	1.0596092	-0.2318	-0.0144602531478	0.851556217	2656	1740	2293.1832	2033.9935	0.8311371	0.7130409	-0.2211	0.00381650235591	0.857910118	6909	3760	6140.6613	4261.0594	1.8631565	1.2665287	-0.5569	-0.416071339401	0.679775819	3655	2437	3163.4385	2823.923	1.2110751	1.0665921	-0.1833	0.0602993662355	0.880698520	1782	1068	1541.3796	1254.8476	0.5724892	0.4918517	-0.2190	0.0775585795948	0.8591457!sample_table_end
