Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481740/suppl/GSM481740_JBH492.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5298	6067	5477.4535	5779.8347	1.4923808	1.5461795	0.0511	0.113951148987	1.03604892	3745	4876	3914.2944	4660.2086	1.2476312	1.3756969	0.1410	0.119029284082	1.1026473	5449	5918	5625.9076	5640.6492	1.3404691	1.3462097	0.0062	0.0709200046536	1.00428254	9786	9356	9916.2967	8913.0186	2.5344133	2.3123295	-0.1323	-0.00301478812092	0.91237275	13555	13450	13636.677	12818.832	3.4493954	3.2085122	-0.1044	0.0182161165404	0.93016666	8174	9037	8324.9622	8616.5782	2.1002893	2.1458157	0.0309	0.0322029922362	1.02167627	3236	3375	3409.7026	3218.8283	0.8055764	0.7724874	-0.0605	0.0465435843733	0.95892518	2672	3165	2830.4883	3020.541	0.7151992	0.7839382	0.1324	0.0685895084678	1.09611179	5419	7124	5596.5558	6809.4783	1.685903	1.9490164	0.2092	0.146967967631	1.156066710	10305	11880	10427.343	11317.446	2.5328671	2.9028013	0.1967	0.0577207283235	1.146053511	17379	15127	17366.123	14408.449	4.258873	3.6925003	-0.2059	-0.185873042503	0.867013512	8794	8237	8936.774	7867.902	1.991572	1.8431164	-0.1118	-0.0425427840524	0.92545813	7071	8056	7235.8537	7697.0702	1.5878608	1.7664128	0.1537	0.0404764257423	1.112448114	5259	8433	5439.0379	8052.4256	2.7439808	2.8680012	0.0638	0.0462344185555	1.045197215	4765	5599	4943.5848	5346.8906	1.0846913	1.2538704	0.2091	0.0805984536529	1.155969816	4518	5541	4694.8469	5293.8586	1.0301256	1.209325	0.2314	0.059709400554	1.173958817	1547	1964	1672.7776	1877.2699	0.5149009	0.5447387	0.0813	0.0842052609231	1.057948718	4148	6118	4331.2417	5827.8336	1.4660348	1.5686828	0.0976	-0.016447954738	1.070017419	3716	4982	3885	4760.9005	1.1817566	1.4115972	0.2564	0.140388781019	1.194490620	2266	2489	2417.4377	2376.185	0.6142066	0.6052671	-0.0212	0.065721191694	0.9854455!sample_table_end
