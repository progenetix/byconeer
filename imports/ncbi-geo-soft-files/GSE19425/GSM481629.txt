Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9775!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481629/suppl/GSM481629_JA686.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	686	665	643.0008	783.4496	0.4834616	0.5897923	-0.2868	-0.214449381305	0.8197152	797	967	748.2101	1089.5383	0.6809603	0.877634	-0.3660	-0.290559296502	0.77590463	1618	1823	1518.3382	1898.4505	0.9955204	1.2913879	-0.3754	-0.251975368528	0.77089184	2946	4084	2777.696	3853.4288	2.6297353	3.3672839	-0.3567	-0.564130333349	0.78096635	4420	8994	4186.1697	8077.4454	3.6622466	6.2751678	-0.7769	-0.660147261341	0.58360936	4856	4638	4589.1359	4334.5226	2.334201	2.0960755	0.1552	0.129679596397	1.11360547	3255	1721	3073.8977	1807.028	1.5196468	0.83358	0.8663	0.706290241748	1.82303658	2730	2158	2574.5395	2192.503	1.068234	0.9503642	0.1687	0.212175228515	1.1240269	2166	1157	2039.7618	1275.5705	1.4125169	0.8181544	0.7878	0.644525168149	1.726467310	5779	7481	5422.568	6762.3268	3.1987403	3.5677791	-0.1575	-0.0662733263882	0.896563411	2007	2591	1891.8582	2553.5641	1.7874202	1.989818	-0.1548	-0.15271082878	0.898283212	3470	4207	3286.4987	3962.6148	1.8693475	2.5131942	-0.4270	-0.541066601124	0.743813413	1023	1125	965.9317	1243.5112	1.0001942	1.0756468	-0.1049	-0.121428794837	0.929853714	5156	4324	4862.7569	4066.2028	3.2243609	2.828128	0.1892	-0.198924736988	1.140104315	981	850	927.3965	971.8342	0.4184423	0.5011752	-0.2603	-0.161680568435	0.834922216	1398	1661	1316.2485	1750.3762	1.1696352	1.4377616	-0.2978	-0.216279565057	0.813511217	712	617	667.1876	732.5519	0.2463631	0.328999	-0.4173	-0.335865687676	0.748826118	1722	1463	1620.7319	1562.159	1.123746	1.0933291	0.0396	0.148491892206	1.027820519	1306	917	1227.0511	1040.8471	0.5206754	0.5517031	-0.0835	-0.0104564551599	0.9437620	1434	1248	1350.8083	1364.093	0.8587984	0.9038765	-0.0738	0.00610079122388	0.9501279!sample_table_end
