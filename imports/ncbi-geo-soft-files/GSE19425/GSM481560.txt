Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481560/suppl/GSM481560_EL622.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2536	2035	2433.4778	2126.6656	0.8416943	0.698273	-0.2695	0.00302893032976	0.8296042	4050	3979	3887.2311	4072.1674	1.6074008	1.6168612	0.0085	0.17875236903	1.00588553	3583	2932	3428.3534	3027.575	1.1670262	0.9904926	-0.2366	0.0656772185224	0.84873214	9324	7650	8868.9781	7703.3636	3.1844964	2.6880216	-0.2445	-0.460125323161	0.84409635	13300	12511	12529.087	12528.68	4.6082689	4.3850239	-0.0716	-0.653310513937	0.95155556	6818	4596	6529.0181	4682.2064	2.4354609	1.6576291	-0.5551	-0.592905624547	0.68062237	2077	1852	1991.2219	1939.8722	0.7200906	0.6621346	-0.1211	-0.466392778576	0.91951578	2155	1502	2063.1663	1589.9579	0.7239381	0.5521801	-0.3907	-0.550978078927	0.76274489	2250	1607	2153.3384	1693.0583	0.8521876	0.6415251	-0.4097	-0.404720294467	0.75279810	9614	7368	9137.4815	7423.5853	3.2902997	2.7135744	-0.2780	-0.362628542694	0.824719511	19389	10183	18028.572	10174.367	6.395661	3.683159	-0.7961	-0.60840310437	0.57588412	5930	3915	5679.8604	4007.9715	2.0407511	1.4622897	-0.4809	-0.507538089166	0.716544813	1738	1564	1672.0471	1650.7353	0.5884303	0.5904293	0.0049	-0.0332846396292	1.003397114	7867	4906	7520.9264	4989.8995	3.1987564	1.9745818	-0.6960	-0.577789135166	0.617296715	2356	2195	2256.3252	2287.3035	0.7622048	0.7649224	0.0051	0.0323425184351	1.003565416	2512	2327	2410.106	2418.3646	0.8312118	0.8286731	-0.0044	-0.136815340598	0.996945817	848	659	845.9824	719.3261	0.3317699	0.2717101	-0.2881	0.101795817235	0.818971718	4995	3403	4787.4992	3483.8369	1.733944	1.1974081	-0.5341	-0.359593484039	0.69056919	1654	1217	1593.3634	1298.3085	0.62809	0.5080686	-0.3059	-0.11414814948	0.808910520	2946	1716	2820.2036	1801.2065	0.9633037	0.6272423	-0.6190	-0.446167569265	0.6511366!sample_table_end
