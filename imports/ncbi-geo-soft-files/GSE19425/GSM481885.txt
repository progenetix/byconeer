Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481885/suppl/GSM481885_MR299.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	11466	8208	9776.152	8724.0446	1.8712305	1.86977	0.0011	0.0488616829739	1.00078112	6408	4091	5907.6413	4193.4099	1.1877331	0.8899209	0.4165	0.197693691622	1.33465013	6808	6276	6211.6117	6592.3107	1.4150683	1.4604043	-0.0455	-0.183062785312	0.96895664	15594	8847	12968.464	9437.3323	2.734487	2.3534195	0.2165	-0.0553561082664	1.16192075	24295	16040	19447.169	17263.53	4.748236	3.9341121	0.2714	-0.0307813447322	1.20693976	9908	9028	8604.1296	9639.7344	1.9850952	2.1915356	-0.1427	-0.113308301875	0.9058017	1658	2380	1818.1672	2365.7589	0.8288855	0.7409262	0.1618	0.0570596778673	1.11871538	3642	3093	3618.2702	3119.3937	0.7338554	0.6993114	0.0696	0.076632835554	1.04939729	8942	8819	7853.7708	9405.992	1.5217022	1.8837862	-0.3079	-0.10239320352	0.807789210	9694	9883	8443.6111	10584.733	1.8067377	2.4381975	-0.4324	-0.305435643815	0.741013711	36583	23570	28741.163	25482.887	6.4570007	6.28111	0.0398	-0.0444917056497	1.028003112	12428	10376	10534.633	11136.461	4.049085	3.1016752	0.3845	-0.0101099982634	1.30545113	6326	9709	5845.8801	10391.238	2.4197252	2.6922504	-0.1540	-0.0928887927927	0.898774214	17789	13771	14613.286	14824.808	3.846597	3.541804	0.1191	-0.0569509060704	1.086055815	4523	5418	4366.2279	5664.3518	1.3594919	1.6848739	-0.3096	-0.150615952013	0.806880516	3269	4460	3288.7342	4608.1826	1.1829912	1.2736568	-0.1065	-0.0356310907632	0.928814817	3789	3975	3741.4594	4063.6016	0.743764	0.8806056	-0.2437	-0.0830702026575	0.844605118	4994	6122	4759.2163	6426.943	1.4394295	1.6565793	-0.2027	-0.0996302659217	0.868916719	6098	6033	5667.1777	6331.7573	1.2036397	1.4561671	-0.2748	-0.14691027454	0.826580820	4322	3493	4196.6784	3553.4507	0.6580768	0.6893854	-0.0671	-0.112120072632	0.9545847!sample_table_end
