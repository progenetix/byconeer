Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481861/suppl/GSM481861_MR265.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5185	6393	5655.3323	5799.7786	1.1791123	1.1224344	0.0711	0.113118370289	1.05049552	6691	8335	7203.4383	7617.11	1.9728445	1.6846785	0.2278	0.0113184398151	1.1710513	5175	5371	5644.8789	4855.5509	1.2129633	1.0715	0.1789	0.0345657800097	1.13202364	18458	14604	19465.631	13356.694	4.0754476	3.0525558	0.4169	0.281254321285	1.33509355	15252	15903	16033.919	14496.329	4.8096012	4.5251449	0.0880	0.0288227330673	1.06286126	10096	12483	10671.536	11464.445	2.4715129	2.6768368	-0.1151	-0.0261004860935	0.9232967	1730	2025	1937.5767	1822.6428	0.6703169	0.6836557	-0.0284	0.0101343120682	0.9804898	2442	2962	2718.9964	2659.0725	0.6716705	0.7224819	-0.1052	-0.0719572594818	0.9296719	8277	12655	8814.6496	11618.871	2.1803987	2.3761937	-0.1241	0.0425846674282	0.917601410	15329	16152	16115.782	14713.523	5.7492308	5.7557547	-0.0016	0.0695179517867	0.998866511	16338	19109	17188.585	17253.901	5.3199665	5.9606862	-0.1641	-0.0603060873506	0.89250912	13201	13628	13868.289	12485.157	4.5277279	4.5569684	-0.0093	0.0368722507679	0.993583313	2866	4103	3179.3594	3690.2042	1.3072709	1.5835142	-0.2766	-0.121445650082	0.825550414	5912	8716	6401.5632	7973.0231	3.7970946	3.3819831	0.1670	0.0984137632567	1.12274215	3458	3364	3834.9444	3021.0826	1.1138402	0.9781429	0.1874	0.180672891326	1.138729516	2895	3599	3210.762	3234.2474	1.0020905	1.153847	-0.2034	-0.0193617814953	0.868477717	1653	2791	1852.2751	2507.7573	0.4863946	0.5381289	-0.1458	-0.0122719767553	0.903862518	3855	6009	4254.2907	5445.9514	1.5315887	1.8977066	-0.3092	-0.109286483027	0.807073419	3378	5427	3748.9385	4906.9149	0.9382382	1.0337999	-0.1399	-0.0133636978875	0.907562620	1982	2375	2219.6765	2138.8969	0.9109581	0.7967032	0.1933	0.0554441818357	1.1434096!sample_table_end
