Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481820/suppl/GSM481820_MR072.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3984	6093	3993.2331	6155.0375	1.0853011	1.5597105	0.5232	0.463677589974	1.43712232	3259	4490	3313.6494	4503.4738	1.0264	1.1576931	0.1737	0.170537984532	1.1279163	4121	3496	4115.5858	3500.4988	1.0697604	0.9075424	-0.2373	-0.131465365647	0.84836044	13734	9692	12480.336	9852.2917	3.1145932	2.5103836	-0.3111	-0.208007958122	0.80600685	16434	10347	14861.315	10527.422	3.9566344	2.7589264	-0.5202	-0.285178178957	0.69729126	9476	6709	8807.104	6787.5185	2.5220195	1.8662816	-0.4344	-0.378798639913	0.73999497	3728	2305	3756.3502	2328.0442	0.8959033	0.5402883	-0.7296	-0.499736769251	0.60306548	3365	3249	3414.245	3255.3611	0.7311589	0.7704013	0.0754	0.049189388861	1.05367159	4112	5553	4107.5123	5609.0858	1.2364031	1.3822779	0.1609	0.128545223691	1.117983210	11683	10691	10686.976	10884.39	2.4713821	2.6538537	0.1028	-0.0496587277861	1.073833811	16626	13298	15030.646	13500.343	3.2779614	3.2050437	-0.0325	-0.0624883402585	0.977755112	10119	8040	9346.3057	8176.1055	1.969813	1.80278	-0.1278	-0.192686891973	0.915203613	6775	6860	6492.0626	6940.4001	1.443704	1.4798006	0.0356	-0.0602536942538	1.025002714	9489	9678	8817.9286	9837.9171	2.9920196	2.5971307	-0.2042	-0.0114110513753	0.868019215	5436	6729	5321.3843	6807.7706	1.020992	1.4260734	0.4821	0.428491040357	1.396752816	4205	4909	4192.4902	4932.2123	0.939364	1.1204475	0.2543	0.0537928228113	1.192772517	1581	2137	1639.8553	2167.991	0.4997047	0.5589507	0.1616	0.0256397722863	1.11856218	5205	7518	5098.8429	7620.0163	1.3979293	1.804225	0.3681	0.178185582553	1.290641119	3175	4164	3230.7824	4168.5531	0.9533151	1.0945667	0.1993	0.159023178308	1.148168820	3233	3404	3288.0066	3411.267	0.750164	0.8224755	0.1328	0.215197970214	1.0963942!sample_table_end
