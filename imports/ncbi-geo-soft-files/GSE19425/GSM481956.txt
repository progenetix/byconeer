Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481956/suppl/GSM481956_MR382.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	7239	4625	6937.1444	4820.1729	2.0887672	1.4288078	-0.5478	0.183849548355	0.68404362	3719	4864	3450.4544	5049.9757	0.8630432	1.3244371	0.6179	0.169351784991	1.53461273	4936	3434	4639.8582	3678.2406	1.6431027	1.2536033	-0.3903	0.113928618949	0.76294894	7934	10008	7637.1129	9815.5754	2.7383392	3.4325212	0.3260	0.0580988106059	1.25350485	11288	13986	10935.893	13691.329	3.707225	4.5074987	0.2820	0.0240651636388	1.21586866	6106	6156	5808.4911	6247.2389	2.1399507	2.2123816	0.0480	0.0601089650216	1.0338477	2237	2667	2059.3262	2913.575	0.5975711	0.8394001	0.4902	0.201896031489	1.40468668	2470	2075	2272.8695	2291.1917	0.6923604	0.6912205	-0.0024	-0.0651777134417	0.99835369	7813	5923	7516.4019	6033.1798	1.7450069	1.467934	-0.2494	-0.047753415479	0.841219610	8783	9199	8475.3894	9064.4105	2.524685	2.6535516	0.0718	-0.107661219052	1.051042611	21207	20246	20272.717	20147.975	6.1544682	6.1240718	-0.0071	-0.00109895859301	0.995061112	9961	12255	9629.8843	11976.529	2.8315212	3.5058645	0.3082	-0.0238634590396	1.238155813	7253	6065	6951.257	6163.7017	1.9478157	1.6991993	-0.1970	-0.179705111865	0.872361514	12727	17499	12335.159	17269.606	3.2098283	4.5587397	0.5061	0.0488760478131	1.420244115	7169	6147	6866.5977	6238.9808	1.9810175	1.760122	-0.1706	-0.00538751955705	0.888493916	4244	4712	3953.3669	4904.5102	1.1164866	1.3852414	0.3112	-0.0410926934667	1.240714717	3212	2236	2968.9328	2462.0196	0.7653193	0.6537445	-0.2273	0.122211115081	0.854211418	5910	5726	5611.1456	5851.7926	1.7839936	1.7816806	-0.0019	0.00844371790429	0.998703519	5158	3998	4867.1877	4216.2027	1.3342844	1.1944737	-0.1597	-0.0532275249765	0.895216720	2643	1918	2435.9181	2123.4514	0.8809057	0.7614375	-0.2103	0.0454105377174	0.8643803!sample_table_end
