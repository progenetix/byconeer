Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481903/suppl/GSM481903_MR317.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3917	4355	3779.0481	4598.4367	1.0898116	1.2173576	-0.1597	-0.0315386676586	0.89522712	3192	4798	3129.0234	5087.5158	1.0141393	1.3399641	-0.4019	-0.211506349725	0.75684073	4903	3524	4615.0787	3670.5664	1.1298019	0.8991261	0.3295	0.00442243285779	1.25655554	12033	10406	10406.421	11285.468	2.2808483	2.6148781	-0.1972	-0.262198502393	0.8722585	15762	15774	13444.94	17071.567	3.725999	4.8373732	-0.3766	-0.354756369513	0.77025266	10146	8283	8872.912	8944.9084	2.341647	2.3607886	-0.0117	-0.0478139166615	0.99189197	3231	3759	3163.2998	3937.4773	0.8769319	1.0333284	-0.2368	-0.14224284891	0.84864788	3308	3714	3230.8533	3886.2451	0.6504595	0.8940782	-0.4589	-0.187618443611	0.72751979	5839	7406	5388.6572	7974.7721	1.6238943	1.8865137	-0.2163	-0.0565510473188	0.860791110	15179	19023	12961.985	20451.115	2.3484878	4.2688934	-0.8621	-0.520286744529	0.550139711	34685	27719	29851.101	29478.913	5.6637258	6.4034556	-0.1771	-0.152963622858	0.884479612	10463	8848	9128.4145	9581.8631	2.0984223	2.2536582	-0.1030	-0.253866027035	0.931118213	11357	9690	9853.767	10517.036	1.8499439	2.1698223	-0.2301	-0.130951737118	0.852578614	8655	10752	7689.9166	11653.894	2.8996338	3.4702004	-0.2591	-0.246074136192	0.835581115	5775	5266	5335.8215	5612.4247	1.050716	1.2237383	-0.2199	-0.105790548898	0.858611716	3846	5238	3718.2461	5581.823	0.8640027	1.289076	-0.5772	-0.270977342525	0.670249617	2074	2945	2119.6527	3042.1128	0.6620346	0.8081762	-0.2878	-0.105126279637	0.819171118	4569	5464	4327.6537	5828.9675	1.4660482	1.8375688	-0.3259	-0.161208017095	0.797819519	3499	4321	3405.1759	4561.8117	0.9909714	1.1562587	-0.2225	-0.120798512394	0.8570520	3192	3649	3129.0234	3812.3361	0.5348064	0.7581834	-0.5035	-0.330357761468	0.7053786!sample_table_end
