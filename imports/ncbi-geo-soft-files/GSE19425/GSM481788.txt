Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481788/suppl/GSM481788_MR026.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2118	1838	2127.3786	1827.2218	0.8270579	0.6944385	-0.2521	-0.13697809469	0.83964912	2032	2093	2042.8396	2079.3687	0.8985998	0.8555925	-0.0708	-0.0190635114934	0.95213963	2494	2658	2501.5863	2642.7939	0.9598831	1.0599959	0.1431	-0.00676253035548	1.10429684	13207	12875	12691.981	13171.143	5.3841382	5.6605934	0.0722	0.0817789143864	1.05134625	25701	24162	24306.806	24922.126	9.7743249	10.582026	0.1145	0.0916945541171	1.0826356	7129	8553	6996.3755	8676.9732	2.9039822	3.6768266	0.3404	0.432088290861	1.26613267	2878	3356	2883.3186	3344.1994	1.075689	1.2764807	0.2469	0.3280824131	1.18666338	2492	2735	2499.6105	2719.4204	1.0910636	1.1828509	0.1165	-0.0157847963549	1.08412639	2781	3021	2786.9458	3007.563	1.1420567	1.1389127	-0.0040	0.040058617023	0.99724710	8105	8678	7915.6253	8806.7176	3.9717016	4.3080505	0.1173	0.134028085539	1.084686311	6197	6093	6102.6964	6127.3763	2.9423737	2.9719581	0.0144	0.135263903955	1.010054612	6793	7622	6675.3897	7711.7432	2.6020488	3.063473	0.2355	0.00577090851447	1.177331113	1943	1952	1954.8854	1939.9508	0.841602	0.8133291	-0.0493	-0.026200178121	0.966405814	10964	11298	10590.691	11531.036	4.2915747	4.4703722	0.0589	-0.0542144353195	1.041662415	1943	2107	1954.8854	2093.1607	0.6946726	0.7579431	0.1258	0.0931527296764	1.091079516	2485	2255	2492.6987	2240.4387	0.9458057	0.8725988	-0.1162	-0.170648826199	0.922598317	527	520	525.1988	535.8516	0.2240765	0.214378	-0.0638	0.076248222083	0.956717818	4568	4825	4545.4355	4831.4253	1.8031547	1.9328915	0.1002	0.00413517987036	1.071949819	1096	1168	1106.2238	1167.4351	0.4897668	0.4777933	-0.0357	-0.109264851629	0.975552720	914	975	923.9854	976.1502	0.4382015	0.4494441	0.0365	-0.0702598950986	1.0256562!sample_table_end
