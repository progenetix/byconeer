Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481475/suppl/GSM481475_DE372.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2891	2536	2575.0994	2707.7956	1.1589124	1.3519898	-0.2223	-0.100155377165	0.85719022	1017	1398	1013.6097	1475.3836	1.0365263	0.9069707	0.1926	0.126740843785	1.14284433	6401	3638	5371.6021	3907.3424	1.8036469	1.7980626	0.0045	0.00445134198367	1.00310574	7639	4050	6368.7902	4349.0729	2.404252	2.1951426	0.1313	0.084614969746	1.095265	12978	7167	10538.723	7753.948	3.638558	3.7460769	-0.0420	-0.0363884344262	0.97129836	9315	5485	7702.798	5889.2413	2.6800647	2.8217744	-0.0743	-0.0461904060479	0.949787	1823	1528	1698.7481	1613.0851	1.0426216	0.9368049	0.1544	-0.123576473358	1.11295498	1582	1055	1487.7197	1116.8033	0.6016299	0.5782634	0.0571	-0.0659216611371	1.04040819	1195	2406	1165.001	2560.569	1.1949964	1.5506229	-0.3758	-0.27332636351	0.770655710	4991	6368	4262.1486	6857.2855	3.0170422	4.4190514	-0.5506	-0.113550647808	0.682735311	17246	13709	13789.319	15424.758	8.0586772	9.3936961	-0.2211	-0.093430741826	0.857881412	2387	2334	2165.6446	2476.6662	1.5361206	1.5402603	-0.0039	0.0578348009744	0.997312313	2524	3954	2275.1824	4246.4553	2.552234	3.2899915	-0.3663	0.02127204966	0.77575714	3432	4886	3007.6089	5248.12	2.5491361	2.9423675	-0.2070	-0.060428435574	0.866355415	3833	3616	3323.6822	3883.6628	2.1721184	2.3836837	-0.1341	0.0825809291798	0.911244416	3296	3345	2900.9086	3586.7212	2.0341625	2.6060714	-0.3574	-0.0827575508402	0.780547517	1343	1773	1287.0991	1874.6454	1.0477997	1.0581916	-0.0142	0.0312288956189	0.990179518	6197	4231	5209.6432	4543.1776	1.8795765	1.9917038	-0.0836	0.00351732744103	0.943702819	1551	2557	1461.1711	2731.0612	1.3766847	1.6515288	-0.2626	-0.0593715106238	0.83358220	1057	960	1047.4765	1021.357	0.9306582	0.7556566	0.3005	0.010154798049	1.2315889!sample_table_end
