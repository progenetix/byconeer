Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481953/suppl/GSM481953_MR379.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	7744	6388	7719.8889	6322.2418	1.4195149	1.1701962	0.2786	0.187622330244	1.21305722	10041	8239	9867.3177	8248.6601	1.8393578	1.5818459	0.2176	0.098259324283	1.1627923	4696	3863	4783.953	3757.6652	0.9785476	0.7594306	0.3657	0.0225472109902	1.2885284	16823	15084	16270.473	15279.419	3.4727443	3.1751126	0.1293	-0.0989777264032	1.09373895	18530	16588	17927.57	16796.658	3.9785925	3.6362658	0.1298	-0.101557878233	1.09414236	10041	9090	9867.3177	9115.2612	2.1229703	1.9458785	0.1257	0.0208900207933	1.09100867	2837	2868	2954.2996	2765.048	0.6312759	0.5916526	0.0935	0.0228982721454	1.06697048	3639	4136	3748.7419	4032.5013	0.8239269	0.9140317	-0.1497	-0.0330114343314	0.90142059	5250	6217	5323.4502	6147.3703	0.9320932	1.105709	-0.2464	-0.0716314053734	0.842982310	15129	11332	14682.727	11440.035	3.4468605	2.831012	0.2840	0.0527608754377	1.217536511	16102	20172	15604.229	20359.264	3.5318655	4.8339629	-0.4528	-0.290802017392	0.730635612	13836	13318	13459.54	13479.9	2.891423	2.8959181	-0.0022	-0.203504691734	0.998447713	5855	5583	5902.6573	5504.511	1.3544201	1.3345279	0.0213	-0.00523119194644	1.014905714	16568	16145	16034.99	16349.755	3.1224612	3.2924851	-0.0765	-0.154746644725	0.9483615	6773	6603	6787.0007	6546.4445	1.3945176	1.3697675	0.0258	0.0170882525351	1.018068816	4525	5166	4618.927	5078.3493	0.9746667	1.0560692	-0.1157	-0.040224266873	0.922919317	1932	1755	2046.6138	1681.2588	0.37686	0.3243882	0.2163	0.146909072408	1.161756218	9660	7945	9510.7607	7946.9169	1.8015638	1.5229105	0.2424	0.122934135994	1.182974119	4956	4614	5038.0172	4520.2463	0.9710783	0.9087402	0.0957	0.0383357373656	1.068598320	3430	3365	3541.6737	3259.3653	0.8181782	0.7994059	0.0335	-0.0618492047622	1.0234828!sample_table_end
