Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481867/suppl/GSM481867_MR277.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4080	4583	4121.3281	4486.6138	1.2919776	1.3866669	-0.1020	-0.0922838496935	0.93171442	4251	4630	4290.038	4532.2161	1.9106583	1.6878073	0.1789	-0.147251076565	1.13203583	3013	2968	3056.5513	2921.9492	0.8129871	0.7976591	0.0275	-0.168408375857	1.01921634	15592	14700	14899.645	14470.72	3.890346	3.9992457	-0.0398	-0.168092819144	0.97276995	18328	21306	17335.841	21073.858	5.5228952	6.8609134	-0.3130	-0.327985179577	0.80497956	10583	12669	10340.613	12468.915	2.8959937	3.6538597	-0.3354	-0.197544767929	0.79258487	2985	3320	3028.2767	3264.4981	0.8697985	0.9711305	-0.1590	-0.032283862625	0.89565568	3066	3464	3109.1028	3401.5991	0.8271043	1.0008882	-0.2751	-0.126488708801	0.82637049	2024	2906	2061.0964	2861.5504	0.9041578	1.0160446	-0.1683	-0.0983045856605	0.8898810	11175	10101	10888.262	9923.6285	3.043348	3.0927117	-0.0232	-0.0525786078765	0.984038711	13161	14199	12697.95	13974.62	3.3612656	4.1439573	-0.3020	-0.24047302577	0.811124512	13576	13157	13076.323	12946.765	3.4103701	3.7729306	-0.1458	-0.257892040669	0.903904813	3537	4376	3574.3362	4284.8574	1.0189142	1.3037407	-0.3556	-0.151741171893	0.781531314	7145	10213	7104.0046	10036.038	3.4221658	3.8706727	-0.1777	-0.262539571287	0.884126815	3128	2888	3170.5574	2844.1177	0.7672118	0.7711553	-0.0074	-0.00232916265508	0.994886216	2351	2818	2396.9603	2776.3096	0.6292341	0.7772314	-0.3047	-0.209826863248	0.80958417	690	617	669.7168	668.1163	0.2855319	0.2471132	0.2085	0.104891487439	1.1554718	4884	5865	4919.0829	5740.6778	1.4263917	1.5610115	-0.1301	-0.128433233602	0.913761119	1122	1496	1156.0171	1498.942	0.5319879	0.5769116	-0.1170	0.0165714835621	0.922130720	2647	2883	2684.6948	2839.2748	0.7259475	0.8196032	-0.1751	-0.310133195853	0.8857304!sample_table_end
