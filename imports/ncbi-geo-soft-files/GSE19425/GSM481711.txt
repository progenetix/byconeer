Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481711/suppl/GSM481711_JBH209.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3659	3552	3836.9271	3406.238	0.8182351	0.7179721	0.1886	0.0959836789567	1.13964742	4617	4101	4786.3077	3941.7529	1.3217241	1.0762618	0.2964	0.212754465055	1.22806933	4642	3554	4810.3639	3408.1941	0.8339066	0.5851764	0.5110	0.259058877022	1.42505154	20390	19040	18845.769	19538.37	3.1340059	3.3909769	-0.1137	-0.134026898389	0.92421925	27453	24860	24737.545	25939.687	4.5717453	4.7194664	-0.0459	-0.14251286122	0.96869966	12836	11840	12314.284	11807.234	2.3256097	2.2183672	0.0681	0.19387668579	1.0483437	3841	3880	4014.6585	3726.091	0.8278207	0.6968214	0.2485	0.281814313769	1.18799548	4584	4804	4754.5482	4638.4601	0.7865799	0.815132	-0.0514	-0.156730575361	0.96497249	3374	4144	3555.0099	3983.7543	0.9529845	1.0986843	-0.2053	-0.131423123872	0.867386910	15872	13648	14974.06	13720.202	2.8286307	2.749434	0.0410	0.0636817149688	1.028804711	24601	18633	22377.962	19100.987	3.9282215	3.5545278	0.1442	0.104198154442	1.105131712	7484	7422	7507.5186	7245.2585	1.3814985	1.3202687	0.0654	0.202098835842	1.046376713	5006	4493	5153.154	4336.6644	1.142161	0.8876886	0.3636	0.186427787184	1.286668414	8068	8143	8047.8269	7994.7459	2.6552425	2.372552	0.1624	0.161652963398	1.119150415	6634	5579	6701.6442	5412.3125	1.1098968	0.9567026	0.2143	0.0809739983828	1.160127316	5640	6970	5739.8129	6791.2092	1.1170384	1.2252414	-0.1334	-0.10962420833	0.911688417	1337	998	1445.1805	1046.9397	0.3853433	0.2793163	0.4642	0.250131724645	1.379594718	7277	7623	7311.6304	7453.9625	1.3796747	1.3882963	-0.0090	-0.0334232328195	0.993789819	2961	2642	3141.0963	2553.1416	0.8079261	0.703624	0.1994	0.0343546244033	1.148235520	4046	4887	4218.5194	4716.4504	0.7838084	0.8980707	-0.1963	-0.118802176844	0.8727691!sample_table_end
