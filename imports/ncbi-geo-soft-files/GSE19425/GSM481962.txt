Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481962/suppl/GSM481962_MR390.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6585	4593	5855.1588	5026.6623	1.6841452	1.4197629	-0.2464	-0.08998020554	0.84301692	5176	4489	4654.1638	4913.0677	1.4406488	1.4767899	0.0357	-0.0626810868979	1.02508673	4648	3058	4192.7781	3412.4254	1.1124602	0.9007632	-0.3045	0.00986409911376	0.80970374	10631	7077	9209.859	7697.496	2.3678078	1.9661483	-0.2682	-0.134890002129	0.83036655	17514	16355	14905.927	18169.192	4.2725476	5.1305455	0.2640	0.28903837356	1.20081656	9083	5744	7933.4457	6250.2066	2.2473784	1.727643	-0.3794	-0.0801929909298	0.7687377	3053	2797	2735.2526	3147.8136	0.7865146	0.8456786	0.1046	0.107367696078	1.0752238	3938	3065	3556.2985	3419.4131	0.8561646	0.8234574	-0.0562	-0.035369253973	0.96179819	7802	5822	6885.9889	6336.6987	1.9559059	1.7641564	-0.1489	-0.146449945014	0.901963810	14383	10606	12318.959	11620.422	3.381627	3.2190622	-0.0711	-0.054963330534	0.951927111	18402	10239	15641.089	11206.735	4.2651211	3.1178819	-0.4520	-0.405480763253	0.731018412	8854	7419	7747.3695	8076.7984	2.1078976	2.0661609	-0.0289	-0.0711421256065	0.980199813	6728	5481	5974.6571	5959.7643	1.7134255	1.6104142	-0.0895	-0.142405101826	0.939879914	10550	8708	9142.9033	9476.7902	3.0524356	3.026601	-0.0123	-0.0661113932545	0.991536415	4802	3277	4327.7692	3642.7834	1.1553421	0.9160552	-0.3348	-0.447901381654	0.792886516	4325	4279	3899.3241	4688.3905	1.0211889	1.1496408	0.1709	-0.0252022610822	1.125786717	2206	1563	1955.7441	1838.304	0.6246785	0.5720668	-0.1269	-0.0464474650936	0.915778118	7074	3943	6271.8633	4348.6789	1.7001878	1.1885696	-0.5165	-0.47423262286	0.699081419	3614	2777	3257.4293	3127.0843	0.9742082	0.9189371	-0.0843	-0.148401832153	0.943265720	4548	2906	4104.9239	3260.2544	0.9936791	0.819626	-0.2778	-0.187173998732	0.8248397!sample_table_end
