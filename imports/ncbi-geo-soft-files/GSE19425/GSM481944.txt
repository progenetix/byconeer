Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481944/suppl/GSM481944_MR370.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5432	2724	5344.9074	3027.9937	1.6437932	0.9221015	-0.8340	0.0563443540948	0.56095952	5363	6345	5269.2082	5922.5167	1.7221932	1.9678917	0.1924	0.175812760026	1.1426663	3566	3395	3332.0068	3632.2793	1.1356506	1.1838078	0.0599	0.0595161526808	1.04240494	10935	16067	11245.705	13202.834	3.9944958	4.537593	0.1839	0.0418458719255	1.13596135	12108	15707	12400.68	12917.018	4.5351066	4.4870204	-0.0154	-0.0367494000949	0.98939696	6421	7774	6473.4905	6986.2343	2.2794802	2.3775545	0.0608	0.110482182282	1.04302487	2057	2764	1799.1755	3065.3788	0.6092376	1.0063067	0.7240	0.381829665578	1.65174748	2378	1881	2109.4116	2197.5961	0.7562412	0.7529007	-0.0064	-0.0980674276186	0.99558279	3898	2891	3681.6307	3182.9423	1.1100384	0.9829217	-0.1755	-0.165744289885	0.885484410	8234	9001	8462.9914	7891.9496	3.3993218	2.9900274	-0.1851	-0.137754109901	0.879595211	18969	17072	18621.591	14006.629	7.2479649	5.2714298	-0.4594	-0.195414741469	0.727297912	9080	15044	9331.0586	12391.589	2.9976827	3.9420698	0.3951	-0.0593538468965	1.31503913	4661	3188	4520.9404	3449.3621	1.6099524	1.1595508	-0.4735	-0.212118180054	0.720239114	12207	15074	12498.535	12414.631	3.9238047	3.9974569	0.0268	-0.14095696739	1.018770615	5227	4619	5124.9343	4628.8311	1.5674603	1.3582209	-0.2067	-0.18306473439	0.866510516	3208	2743	2951.2555	3045.8344	0.9294226	0.9458579	0.0253	-0.274510878053	1.017683217	1001	786	867.5951	971.2018	0.2911614	0.3202426	0.1373	0.135044519659	1.099879818	5861	5797	5829.29	5512.0124	1.7646587	1.6889084	-0.0633	-0.0398900170167	0.957073719	2965	1770	2695.9942	2079.4421	0.9213438	0.7058938	-0.3843	-0.191756816182	0.766156820	2006	1298	1750.8971	1567.1705	0.6446786	0.5797887	-0.1531	-0.216959790368	0.8993452!sample_table_end
