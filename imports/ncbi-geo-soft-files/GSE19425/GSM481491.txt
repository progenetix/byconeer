Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481491/suppl/GSM481491_DE400.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2186	1421	1915.5531	1585.9735	1.3947218	1.1755954	0.2466	0.296766793736	1.18639612	1107	989	955.8115	1142.3698	0.9002954	0.9427895	-0.0665	-0.100554313002	0.95492733	2607	1285	2282.1776	1448.9342	1.6559622	1.242783	0.4141	0.299926977349	1.33246284	2996	2166	2614.9791	2352.4546	1.8774202	1.9376774	-0.0456	-0.234741242136	0.96890245	6747	5450	5591.3757	6009.9797	4.0103146	5.3697805	-0.4211	-0.509727454812	0.74683036	4709	3159	3997.108	3395.2953	2.9914128	2.9911615	0.0001	-0.0449541830842	1.0000847	2129	1180	1866.4341	1337.8462	1.5206394	1.0485219	0.5363	0.201168360113	1.45026968	1009	835	865.5976	981.3071	0.5707008	0.7041097	-0.3031	-0.237993831626	0.81052829	1857	1417	1629.0556	1581.8151	1.5907994	1.2660378	0.3294	0.147335356998	1.256518110	5288	3873	4450.9133	4181.4256	3.1803166	2.8086831	0.1793	0.237411609372	1.132315911	12243	7321	9586.3235	8271.2128	6.2776243	5.6435726	0.1536	0.27140774688	1.112349412	2164	2004	1896.5975	2182.8381	1.4556967	1.5979275	-0.1345	-0.137919811422	0.910990513	2090	2284	1832.7558	2477.5946	2.1559532	2.1516983	0.0028	0.276566699415	1.001977414	2980	2916	2601.5098	3140.4224	3.1818019	2.9843665	0.0924	-0.0698338594706	1.066156515	2818	2070	2464.3405	2251.6703	1.7623751	1.4594912	0.2721	0.296934614541	1.20752716	2261	1576	1980.1022	1750.3762	1.4633104	1.2610789	0.2146	0.237031450445	1.160363917	1168	845	1010.9173	992.0832	0.8841073	0.7827168	0.1757	0.169515730963	1.129536618	2257	1500	1976.6656	1668.5268	1.2770487	1.4673536	-0.2004	0.0327931706413	0.870307419	1725	1431	1510.6493	1596.3666	1.4547314	1.1999142	0.2778	0.342224526221	1.212362820	1375	678	1203.5817	819.1031	0.9185213	0.5686868	0.6917	0.361942145988	1.615162!sample_table_end
