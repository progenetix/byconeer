Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481932/suppl/GSM481932_MR358.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	8420	6655	8416.9915	6577.5405	1.5664158	1.1699673	-0.4210	0.0193936321895	0.74690732	5496	6707	5513.1953	6625.8737	1.0632315	1.2793233	0.2669	0.032468066372	1.20324073	7535	5749	7531.5205	5719.5133	1.346058	0.9972031	-0.4328	0.018868005658	0.74083224	14080	15002	13951.756	14646.101	2.3524835	2.3693759	0.0103	-0.190746092817	1.00718075	20726	21155	20308.361	20865.339	3.9275768	3.8399844	-0.0325	-0.211440801124	0.97769816	12367	13161	12275.532	12826.095	2.3341308	2.3756455	0.0254	0.0497050611215	1.01778597	4097	4316	4107.3831	4341.8372	0.8212432	0.8603768	0.0672	0.0236377488931	1.04765178	4625	4585	4637.0448	4602.991	0.7036924	0.6962656	-0.0153	-0.046021000052	0.98944599	9596	9697	9578.7019	9473.1758	1.7151837	1.7043046	-0.0092	0.00305254071289	0.993657110	19213	19404	18879.93	19079.504	2.8450461	2.8955975	0.0254	-0.0438723449418	1.017768211	39795	30087	38343.502	30189.902	5.8531991	4.7352236	-0.3058	-0.272626762717	0.808997512	12908	15844	12812.305	15498.795	2.1590041	2.6442672	0.2925	-0.237266647343	1.224762413	12636	11431	12542.428	11158.159	2.0670403	1.8694054	-0.1450	-0.139020775569	0.904387514	16184	17428	15997.186	17079.351	3.1089583	3.3314507	0.0997	-0.256843387011	1.07156515	9106	7959	9098.8376	7821.1153	1.4277384	1.2159404	-0.2317	0.0124701306697	0.851654916	6092	5923	6107.6919	5886.0015	1.0392258	1.000053	-0.0554	-0.158995957075	0.962305817	5190	4222	5199.2896	4250.4746	0.9905073	0.8091651	-0.2917	0.034214165567	0.816919818	8250	7951	8246.6622	7813.5185	1.6865122	1.5128256	-0.1568	0.0189671091657	0.897014319	5711	5288	5730.87	5284.9351	1.0999995	1.0122541	-0.1199	-0.0616387118741	0.920231420	4660	3537	4672.0767	3590.5577	0.6560361	0.5266464	-0.3169	-0.124179762168	0.8027705!sample_table_end
