Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481737/suppl/GSM481737_JBH489.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5582	4500	5418.572	4593.059	2.0026815	1.607765	0.3169	0.185912330335	1.24563072	3381	3582	3208.4327	3720.1685	1.1852559	1.2884431	-0.1204	-0.0676095264871	0.91991333	4374	3990	4200.0217	4117.592	1.4968932	1.42654	0.0695	-0.122793608497	1.04931734	10037	11408	9903.982	10681.728	3.3660029	3.6912204	-0.1331	-0.216518402004	0.91189435	14364	17358	14203.138	15844.534	5.2607036	5.8857122	-0.1620	-0.215773476728	0.89380926	6444	5638	6276.5245	5627.3886	2.3931732	2.1030197	0.1865	0.130363957171	1.13796997	2704	2325	2556.9636	2484.4136	0.8621281	0.8549702	0.0120	-0.0548332625943	1.00837218	2776	2261	2626.4685	2419.6958	0.825782	0.8029622	0.0404	0.0464463572586	1.02841959	3817	3267	3636.3379	3416.0917	1.2474058	1.0826422	0.2044	0.199414795877	1.152186510	7304	6514	7154.0296	6416.0606	2.7729394	2.5254061	0.1349	0.185887979478	1.098017211	11522	14405	11376.617	13261.994	4.1532884	5.0514676	-0.2824	-0.204502236355	0.822194412	11348	16538	11202.397	15127.571	3.1794364	4.7597985	-0.5821	-0.607316899002	0.667977113	5651	5324	5487.4503	5337.608	1.9591395	1.8820512	0.0579	0.119392434881	1.040959714	8394	10996	8254.1213	10329.101	3.8311688	4.1683062	-0.1217	-0.168745375524	0.919118915	4717	4077	4540.9598	4201.6762	1.31578	1.3069988	0.0097	0.029708289994	1.006718516	3641	3508	3464.7124	3648.4818	1.0060378	1.1329025	-0.1713	-0.0299388236734	0.88801817	1339	1297	1264.7462	1409.0364	0.4605412	0.4873624	-0.0817	-0.0866051381421	0.944966618	3287	3539	3113.3516	3678.5247	1.7089669	1.5863277	0.1074	0.186401416495	1.077310119	3164	2672	2990.3685	2829.8216	1.0937357	0.9922121	0.1405	0.175760905882	1.102320420	2250	1755	2115.1134	1891.0284	0.7460643	0.6720855	0.1507	0.0111032812131	1.1100735!sample_table_end
