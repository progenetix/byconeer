Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481745/suppl/GSM481745_JBH513.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1197	1332	1329.2503	1203.1548	1.0975202	0.9452597	0.2155	-0.0137964782193	1.16107792	451	557	519.3437	500.0856	0.9009277	0.7870577	0.1949	0.234118431346	1.1446783	1850	1650	2001.519	1495.9059	0.8576659	0.6829149	0.3287	0.0273814102546	1.25588974	9551	7703	9519.2269	7270.0372	3.9766854	3.2942735	0.2716	-0.142319339572	1.20715095	13347	15769	13027.803	15275.427	5.9002091	7.3534426	-0.3177	-0.154973918104	0.80237376	6152	6982	6292.6169	6567.7371	3.0322434	3.3906526	-0.1612	-0.201459811234	0.89429497	1515	1870	1657.9604	1700.4703	1.0315984	1.1027541	-0.0962	-0.286318999248	0.93547458	1990	2030	2148.0815	1849.7472	0.8602877	0.8245203	0.0613	0.0373154452914	1.04337969	733	1044	833.7408	938.8708	1.4773308	1.5106597	-0.0322	0.0848870468137	0.977937410	8073	8958	8129.5093	8500.7019	3.0595649	3.6342099	-0.2483	-0.257878257392	0.841878911	11535	9872	11359.942	9405.5614	4.1758963	3.9969896	0.0632	0.0105882304005	1.044760312	4677	3846	4843.5632	3570.3843	2.6257808	2.0814823	0.3351	0.00806200657233	1.261495513	1201	1596	1333.3582	1447.1748	0.7832787	0.8730854	-0.1566	-0.105277194853	0.897138614	1897	2719	2050.9817	2498.1985	3.3744352	3.658971	-0.1168	-0.199615316229	0.922236115	1570	1714	1714.0827	1555.8862	0.7286781	0.7283232	0.0007	-0.0719597768359	1.000487216	1036	1370	1158.7527	1237.8089	0.6467412	0.7342704	-0.1831	0.0832766922345	0.880794217	291	392	317.8322	362.8087	0.4796844	0.5042012	-0.0719	0.0595625289938	0.951374918	2678	3449	2851.8625	3188.3075	1.5109556	1.6521445	-0.1289	-0.212946798474	0.91454219	402	506	460.5849	456.0467	0.726401	0.6591706	0.1401	0.081671218297	1.101992420	1550	1461	1693.6898	1324.2455	0.913164	0.6600755	0.4682	0.0334683917538	1.3834235!sample_table_end
