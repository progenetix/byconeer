Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481601/suppl/GSM481601_EL665.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2929	2417	2912.8151	2415.3568	0.8098279	0.701423	0.2073	-0.0477221890928	1.15454992	4389	3435	4323.6315	3445.039	1.2459862	1.0323234	0.2714	0.201755167905	1.20697273	2637	1991	2631.6459	1985.0891	0.8804598	0.677495	0.3780	-0.0114401928625	1.29958134	10932	11265	10449.024	11436.534	3.71266	4.1793295	-0.1708	-0.0170665120112	0.88833865	10172	12602	9746.5395	12824.786	3.5995712	4.6810594	-0.3790	0.0843486926581	0.7689656	8469	8015	8176.6201	8096.4717	2.8883149	2.9761039	-0.0432	-0.0819165800903	0.9705027	1690	2256	1716.0266	2252.538	0.8099802	0.9511976	-0.2319	0.0680272836371	0.85153728	2116	2138	2128.0005	2131.4046	0.7328332	0.7516184	-0.0365	-0.0146564968175	0.97500689	3727	3777	3687.3793	3791.9507	0.98078	1.0599522	-0.1120	-0.0418029058897	0.925305810	12642	12361	12042.626	12574.01	4.1811076	4.2965112	-0.0393	0.034125684977	0.973140111	12585	11644	11990.38	11830.024	4.3174133	4.1784837	0.0472	-0.0185953749069	1.033248812	4152	4385	4098.5946	4395.8085	1.948862	1.909654	0.0293	-0.0337921117833	1.020531413	1526	1780	1556.3715	1773.8142	0.6798942	0.6933359	-0.0282	0.0702359818691	0.98061314	8082	6447	7818.4156	6502.3297	2.4122233	2.051242	0.2339	0.14133848294	1.175981815	2952	2774	2934.7187	2774.5825	1.1710033	1.053398	0.1527	0.0889514773805	1.111643816	2057	2420	2070.3427	2418.3935	0.9330246	1.018191	-0.1260	0.0557208440403	0.916355117	916	828	962.83734	825.1595	0.2743625	0.2466976	0.1533	-0.00459742490989	1.112141118	5059	4453	4970.4457	4463.9382	1.5101125	1.3891897	0.1204	-0.0635105091172	1.087045619	3119	2340	3095.2955	2337.5459	0.8137516	0.6750531	0.2696	0.0634783679612	1.205463120	2573	2321	2569.8321	2318.3499	0.7380585	0.6826813	0.1125	-0.124411674802	1.0811172!sample_table_end
