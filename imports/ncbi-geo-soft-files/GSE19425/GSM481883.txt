Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481883/suppl/GSM481883_MR297.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5424	4937	5398.1573	4879.2432	1.5425268	1.4723202	0.0672	0.0819006421854	1.04768442	4702	4438	4695.0259	4389.3113	1.6634755	1.4732915	0.1752	0.0770416913243	1.12908783	4626	3858	4620.7466	3808.1137	1.1284223	1.0246078	0.1392	-0.090697127888	1.10132124	15502	11867	14853.989	11706.258	3.1626912	2.8945631	0.1278	-0.0997083950961	1.09263165	15252	12866	14616.979	12686.923	3.9650443	3.8137284	0.0561	-0.138390717789	1.03967666	8137	7609	7936.6694	7519.3056	2.1316454	2.2327662	-0.0669	-0.0753736324478	0.95471067	2004	2531	2069.8166	2508.3661	0.6873706	0.7206051	-0.0681	-0.0579220756604	0.95387988	3630	3754	3666.5885	3709.9789	0.8297453	0.911163	-0.1350	-0.0256678472839	0.91064429	4932	6336	4919.3315	6270.0692	1.6689918	1.9554812	-0.2285	-0.062691950662	0.853494210	12732	13413	12237.45	13223.374	2.8136524	3.2878297	-0.2247	-0.201567461216	0.85577811	19677	18428	18827.392	18115.09	4.4021893	4.6478707	-0.0783	-0.103588372538	0.947141112	9637	9281	9347.3576	9158.7164	2.3772355	2.3032427	0.0456	-0.179574947568	1.032125513	7253	8538	7115.7891	8419.7693	1.706686	1.9304389	-0.1777	-0.104769732413	0.884092214	7761	9026	7583.1891	8903.7837	3.0871815	3.2915943	-0.0925	-0.162748093698	0.937898615	4698	4655	4691.1187	4605.8365	1.0926805	1.114939	-0.0291	-0.0103760233642	0.980036116	3731	4617	3760.7734	4569.0871	0.9553797	1.1328003	-0.2457	-0.105236287123	0.843378717	1403	1698	1466.1431	1685.8652	0.5132046	0.5675837	-0.1453	-0.0338940205176	0.904192118	4621	5650	4615.8578	5588.8647	1.5353735	1.725045	-0.1680	-0.0822973069082	0.890048419	3053	3472	3108.0207	3441.9784	1.0403463	1.1125265	-0.0968	-0.0579120587186	0.935120520	4416	4041	4418.728	3988.9435	0.9515575	0.8752565	0.1206	-0.0183001416846	1.0871756!sample_table_end
