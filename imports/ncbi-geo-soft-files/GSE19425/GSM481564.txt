Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481564/suppl/GSM481564_EL626.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2730	2318	2808.8992	2263.7623	0.7267842	0.5733649	-0.3421	-0.0913052021431	0.78890672	4685	5416	4845.7624	5175.8989	1.5828201	1.518307	-0.0600	0.0499622010336	0.95924173	3694	3311	3814.0816	3199.956	0.9840236	0.8651113	-0.1858	0.0549465283157	0.8791574	13491	11312	13673.739	10834.689	3.3588431	2.9061833	-0.2088	-0.252725957876	0.86523345	13020	15990	13215.318	15472.906	4.1595412	4.8123963	0.2103	-0.263075459748	1.15695366	8624	8158	8861.6311	7786.9617	2.5106961	2.2810381	-0.1384	-0.104640944023	0.90852817	2566	3453	2636.5558	3335.3259	1.03202	1.1822439	0.1961	-0.138991068411	1.14556298	2975	2756	3061.8816	2675.3939	0.7606433	0.7165031	-0.0862	-0.228664076813	0.94196989	2768	3251	2848.2924	3143.3258	0.9084496	0.8816107	-0.0433	-0.0809968667203	0.970456310	14865	15770	15011.121	15251.787	4.3511611	4.564518	0.0691	-0.0520548381905	1.049034411	16541	11640	16640.074	11160.351	4.6191712	3.2687652	-0.4989	-0.43067544977	0.707651812	5728	5519	5921.6075	5271.5957	1.9352454	1.6890462	-0.1963	-0.153825823215	0.872781413	2539	2568	2608.8428	2497.1897	0.8732363	0.8197546	-0.0912	-0.043628576947	0.938754614	7905	7658	8135.0002	7317.162	2.7832649	2.2431386	-0.3113	-0.248255068549	0.805937815	2632	2854	2705.955	2768.8122	0.7963408	0.8024586	0.0110	0.0227015918515	1.007682416	2520	3359	2589.8394	3245.7047	0.87977	1.0575913	0.2656	0.0457312013831	1.202122417	889	953	926.2541	958.5816	0.2834272	0.2667256	-0.0876	0.127174185363	0.941072618	4694	4528	4855.1897	4343.0506	1.4509096	1.2934473	-0.1657	-0.044053026326	0.891473319	3090	2793	3179.6323	2710.6712	0.9742537	0.7793777	-0.3220	-0.108714356121	0.79997420	2637	2605	2711.2142	2532.2573	0.8072238	0.7699639	-0.0682	0.0946259164841	0.9538418!sample_table_end
