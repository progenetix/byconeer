Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481764/suppl/GSM481764_JBH536.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2430	2449	2509.9789	2348.1925	0.9714597	0.8999716	-0.1103	-0.00213531097984	0.92641162	2612	3028	2699.4262	2910.1913	1.1043958	1.1211055	0.0217	0.179553470615	1.01513013	1375	1521	1443.0397	1475.3766	0.5381208	0.5741672	0.0935	0.0711850638661	1.06698584	10534	8533	10436.087	8144.7891	3.9296771	3.3350768	-0.2367	0.0226743243081	0.84868975	14419	15125	14147.239	14394.234	5.8542189	6.034931	0.0439	-0.0488677927794	1.03086866	7940	7979	7925.8229	7615.8534	3.2301546	3.1775228	-0.0237	-0.0155051141677	0.98370617	1961	2103	2039.7404	2025.0447	1.1013115	1.0590504	-0.0565	0.0106548236326	0.96162658	2366	2138	2443.8399	2057.8567	0.9156561	0.8372788	-0.1291	-0.00321743348379	0.91440319	3437	4041	3514.1256	3866.1503	1.3562262	1.380978	0.0261	0.102473239575	1.018250510	9791	9847	9729.4517	9394.3468	3.7136331	3.9034125	0.0719	0.0135761701526	1.051103411	9327	9611	9281.5971	9170.2269	3.4434432	3.872765	0.1695	0.1358478028	1.12467812	4438	3679	4516.4586	3526.7694	2.0858544	1.7677498	-0.2387	-0.0350096533232	0.847494313	1598	1884	1667.0317	1820.0747	0.7377395	0.8778224	0.2508	-0.0657120831972	1.189881214	6912	6910	6927.6374	6596.2601	3.5842712	2.7760671	-0.3686	-0.0572527304888	0.774513615	1652	1757	1719.2454	1698.2071	0.7134338	0.7753778	0.1201	0.0206003393699	1.08682516	1407	1887	1476.4928	1822.9496	0.6637007	0.8835811	0.4128	0.0355395975765	1.331294417	809	1049	868.514	1033.2215	0.3607405	0.4063068	0.1716	-0.0178811264702	1.126313118	2626	3459	2714.0482	3317.4754	1.3084539	1.3146608	0.0068	-0.0697585276659	1.004743619	1273	1696	1337.5796	1639.4753	0.547235	0.635441	0.2156	0.0285195056603	1.16118520	2448	2039	2528.5808	1965.0078	0.8258963	0.7353819	-0.1675	0.0828992946769	0.8904047!sample_table_end
