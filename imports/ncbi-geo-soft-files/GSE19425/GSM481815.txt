Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481815/suppl/GSM481815_MR067.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	8822	4843	8004.282	5254.1044	1.4968197	0.991597	0.5941	0.750032828407	1.5095042	6018	4442	5508.7805	4829.1958	1.1594814	0.9645572	0.2655	0.186463412206	1.20208673	5561	3934	5101.45	4289.7843	0.9492371	0.83459	0.1857	0.0877037002966	1.13736934	17250	14747	15383.889	15683.39	2.8983124	3.1985132	-0.1422	-0.201704121408	0.90614365	21330	16408	18882.271	17459.499	3.4927716	3.4496438	0.0179	-0.239399126438	1.01250216	13377	10591	11987.065	11244.215	2.3422976	2.3650802	-0.0140	-0.0841658514082	0.9903677	3272	3823	3080.7533	4170.0283	0.6768335	0.7878772	-0.2192	-0.19294235321	0.85905968	4418	3189	4094.2895	3489.433	0.8022327	0.7365467	0.1232	0.0995965732322	1.0891819	6732	5009	6158.5428	5428.4355	1.2777415	1.0361389	0.3024	0.352909678122	1.233175910	16353	14173	14575.497	15066.855	3.1060654	3.3058815	-0.0899	-0.0200373093304	0.939557411	19533	12867	17332.122	13689.775	3.4189879	3.0247926	0.1767	-0.0201164967728	1.130321412	11800	11283	10614.2	11981.807	2.2421961	2.3224177	-0.0507	0.00785095330875	0.965457713	7072	6831	6464.1936	7343.5522	1.7068083	1.4996221	0.1867	0.321751729066	1.138158914	15792	12758	14090.015	13576.053	2.8629821	2.5468622	0.1688	0.155129932361	1.124121315	6629	4890	6064.1448	5303.4799	1.1416637	1.0128592	0.1727	0.338617921196	1.127169216	6471	5084	5919.3151	5506.6059	1.22687	1.0323329	0.2491	0.406199439603	1.188444117	1965	1586	1907.7311	1737.7206	0.3879688	0.3459136	0.1655	0.146669557771	1.121577318	10124	7939	9147.9183	8477.9116	1.5411068	1.5578862	-0.0156	0.147239610273	0.989229319	5011	4057	4628.1734	4421.5101	1.0088314	0.9137503	0.1428	0.2390778145	1.104055920	4950	2965	4575.5058	3241.776	0.9749525	0.6988804	0.4803	0.505605410418	1.3950205!sample_table_end
