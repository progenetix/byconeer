Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9775!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481640/suppl/GSM481640_JA697.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	449	1298	673.6792	1031.3279	0.4050538	0.5474305	0.4346	-0.00621961628595	1.35150062	1410	2567	1759.209	2054.8807	0.5775673	0.6571928	0.1863	0.0130765843619	1.13786363	3578	4547	4091.4089	3711.0971	1.2936319	1.2859407	-0.0086	-0.0948072278448	0.99405454	3334	5238	3832.7653	4324.2254	2.9019887	2.4836918	-0.2246	-0.352065584874	0.85585855	18598	14008	18344.276	12543.349	6.0413157	4.2773205	-0.4982	-0.485179414645	0.70801146	5639	11282	6189.8148	9893.5978	1.9241294	2.971136	0.6268	0.448678452446	1.54414567	2519	4806	2968.2647	3946.6202	0.9284406	1.1765426	0.3417	0.592375131725	1.26722448	1693	2795	2077.0964	2243.3893	0.7397436	0.7979152	0.1092	-0.0406107517244	1.07863759	4784	4925	5312.3435	4051.7873	1.6839845	1.3960659	-0.2705	-0.0942720155094	0.829025410	4661	6039	5185.8943	5021.5164	4.586505	4.5528692	-0.0106	0.0503926161748	0.992666311	2316	3895	2749.8995	3160.8813	1.9742937	1.8106843	-0.1248	-0.199457201849	0.917130112	3252	5298	3744.8328	4375.2689	1.8193221	2.0391924	0.1646	-0.223067262695	1.120852813	847	1971	1134.6749	1569.9057	0.9555443	0.9815249	0.0387	-0.181326368202	1.027189314	8051	6059	8540.2906	5039.4588	4.7375055	2.4329207	-0.9614	-0.338625859813	0.513544615	545	883	791.977	685.3689	0.4137333	0.4154944	0.0061	-0.174440875123	1.004256616	2934	3740	3408.2396	3031.0013	2.250062	1.5390469	-0.5479	-0.279935305905	0.684001917	516	819	756.1632	632.9475	0.2936055	0.2709967	-0.1156	-0.0809327299979	0.92299618	2403	4330	2843.719	3523.3942	0.966181	1.2708303	0.3954	0.172616417818	1.315312819	1280	1590	1616.5162	1266.2663	0.5855602	0.5519089	-0.0854	-0.15694198	0.942531420	2869	3188	3339.0622	2572.6546	1.065634	0.8970467	-0.2485	-0.221683061505	0.8417962!sample_table_end
