Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481474/suppl/GSM481474_DE369.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1579	861	1175.0411	1145.7718	0.920243	0.962257	0.0644	0.0626378943313	1.04565542	1278	682	936.9031	931.5227	0.9812149	0.9239648	-0.0867	-0.130367702347	0.94165383	2411	1135	1824.5245	1458.4848	1.254502	1.1871207	-0.0796	-0.00984453060759	0.94628844	4347	1885	3309.2408	2339.0802	2.3908362	2.0072693	-0.2523	-0.162452615293	0.83956795	7217	3675	5481.587	4471.4669	4.583249	4.007078	-0.1938	-0.143707272912	0.87428766	5820	2576	4431.3797	3146.682	3.1827674	2.6347406	-0.2726	-0.299929072966	0.82781447	790	451	550.6553	658.793	0.8361941	0.8354483	-0.0013	0.135646104681	0.99910818	1117	457	804.1773	665.8972	0.6367948	0.5862224	-0.1194	-0.0411873702376	0.92058299	1362	859	1004.6639	1143.5285	1.1140688	1.1387041	0.0316	0.00352927260216	1.022112910	4902	3424	3730.3683	4165.3065	3.6224979	3.8539624	0.0894	-0.166624593025	1.063896411	8973	5848	6770.3671	7176.6618	6.657969	6.8541224	0.0419	-0.0357287963908	1.029461412	1289	870	945.7965	1155.8567	1.3142741	1.3633116	0.0528	-0.00576526052509	1.037311413	1774	1430	1328.1777	1805.6309	2.2447311	2.223663	-0.0136	-0.15219708485	0.990614414	4104	1919	3125.3641	2378.6166	2.5955336	2.3648662	-0.1343	-0.0556348378661	0.911129115	1616	1268	1205.0277	1617.662	1.4403865	1.6834039	0.2249	-0.0194816712157	1.168716816	1119	817	805.7722	1094.5043	1.1195434	1.2827522	0.1963	-0.0198794594332	1.145781617	1029	611	735.2879	847.0266	0.6855512	0.7663188	0.1607	0.146657698288	1.11781418	3764	1312	2866.6677	1669.4595	1.6366422	1.3081134	-0.3233	-0.36724418014	0.799266619	1505	840	1116.3912	1121.6866	1.1460531	1.0392729	-0.1411	-0.228567705934	0.906827920	1153	477	833.3541	689.7204	0.7678191	0.6240597	-0.2991	-0.0851905070226	0.8127692!sample_table_end
