Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481904/suppl/GSM481904_MR318.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6255	3560	5882.023	3749.2567	1.4422089	0.8816795	-0.7100	-0.0315386676586	0.61133962	4707	3529	4474.1926	3717.8064	1.202767	0.9135105	-0.3969	-0.211506349725	0.75950743	5943	4036	5611.0279	4243.2532	1.3436539	0.9759677	-0.4613	0.00442243285779	0.72635344	29904	15547	25825.772	16475.992	4.9854217	3.2884149	-0.6003	-0.262198502393	0.65960615	21061	13685	18579.337	14441.19	4.9533976	3.644498	-0.4427	-0.354756369513	0.73575726	9905	8632	9138.0653	9044.9295	2.3828989	2.2711504	-0.0693	-0.0478139166615	0.95310397	2828	2899	2742.0262	3058.4408	0.7853079	0.8061643	0.0378	-0.14224284891	1.02655838	3867	2446	3698.3462	2579.3355	0.7494007	0.5400189	-0.4727	-0.187618443611	0.7206019	6515	6027	6112.6741	6315.4625	1.5057517	1.4240083	-0.0805	-0.0565510473188	0.945712510	10813	8592	9934.8022	9004.1864	2.1393304	2.0346041	-0.0724	-0.520286744529	0.951047111	30121	20065	26007.185	21480.61	5.5019427	4.8812418	-0.1727	-0.152963622858	0.887185112	16369	8768	14724.613	9183.4245	3.1867882	2.1659822	-0.5571	-0.253866027035	0.679675613	8093	6371	7521.0412	6666.7946	1.8032625	1.5904502	-0.1812	-0.130951737118	0.881984814	15149	12481	13685.206	13127.165	4.2613779	3.4618241	-0.2998	-0.246074136192	0.81237215	8017	5390	7454.972	5658.2563	1.5000781	1.2341864	-0.2815	-0.105790548898	0.822748116	4913	3782	4664.8374	3977.6233	1.057321	0.9347566	-0.1778	-0.270977342525	0.884080217	2564	2642	2492.0522	2784.1233	0.6646687	0.6885731	0.0510	-0.105126279637	1.035964318	6049	5438	5702.7107	5708.1681	1.6217431	1.4448636	-0.1666	-0.161208017095	0.890932419	5333	4160	5056.8046	4373.0705	0.9881137	0.8555627	-0.2078	-0.120798512394	0.865854420	4930	2629	4680.5724	2770.2477	0.6907937	0.4502671	-0.6175	-0.330357761468	0.6518113!sample_table_end
