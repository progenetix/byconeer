Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481501/suppl/GSM481501_DE420.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3002	2604	3150.5195	2442.9288	1.0865294	0.7957481	0.4493	0.228850821842	1.36541882	2744	2396	2894.2558	2254.5023	0.9831872	0.7322768	0.4251	0.459171070618	1.34264413	3025	2860	3173.9487	2679.6186	1.5665996	1.247091	0.3291	0.120532299152	1.25620314	7744	8064	7681.1798	7649.5629	3.3788059	3.2238015	0.0678	0.231839844671	1.04808125	11928	10382	11391.132	9963.9603	4.4561221	3.8833498	0.1985	0.290395384524	1.14749436	5692	10766	5790.7202	10358.755	2.8352433	4.8988735	-0.7890	-0.74343957288	0.57875417	1751	2767	1886.4281	2593.1437	0.8388248	1.1942948	-0.5097	-0.57081892092	0.70235998	1748	2064	1883.4791	1940.1636	0.6329457	0.6302703	0.0061	0.209184453406	1.00424489	2923	3026	3069.9954	2829.7528	0.9618697	0.8401154	0.1953	0.0244344376879	1.144925510	13507	13800	12761.515	13571.639	4.1544194	4.2409347	-0.0297	-0.269255456559	0.979599911	23116	18935	21043.171	19092.7	7.0589878	6.2267013	0.1810	-0.0597813998952	1.133664112	7691	10030	7633.5522	9605.917	3.2270205	3.9089437	-0.2766	0.119556181471	0.825547913	5975	5549	6056.614	5208.287	2.4154344	2.1084537	0.1961	-0.160165134455	1.145595214	9329	9146	9101.7189	8717.4494	5.1796062	4.9102146	0.0771	0.116919368979	1.054863515	4814	4256	4944.9381	3983.891	1.7341317	1.3360179	0.3763	0.0614088942375	1.297985416	3175	2999	3324.4177	2805.4952	1.3438279	1.1212549	0.2612	0.0635808043201	1.198503417	2924	2776	3071.0144	2601.5135	0.9670745	0.789225	0.2932	-0.066260275605	1.22534718	3422	4443	3573.0922	4163.4796	1.769081	2.0071218	-0.1821	-0.210794912456	0.881401819	4169	4059	4317.1257	3797.8064	1.2824307	1.0807092	0.2469	-0.0581334838947	1.186656520	1989	1784	2128.4917	1680.5927	0.7249823	0.5755992	0.3329	0.0805695300626	1.2595263!sample_table_end
