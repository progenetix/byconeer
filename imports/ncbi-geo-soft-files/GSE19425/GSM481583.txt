Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481583/suppl/GSM481583_EL645.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4863	3122	4834.3106	3109.4082	1.1426592	0.7915671	0.5296	0.105966722105	1.44354052	3150	3361	3154.1391	3344.2536	0.8992519	0.9648678	-0.1016	-0.141719019172	0.93199493	1778	2015	1815.9162	2013.091	0.4139787	0.4661007	-0.1711	-0.329963810064	0.88817434	19681	20674	18597.738	20299.86	4.8620582	5.7686093	-0.2467	-0.376269306524	0.84284755	13891	25796	13388.45	25411.345	3.3959841	6.3914965	-0.9123	-0.149017609789	0.53132846	14665	13104	14089.088	12761.795	3.4816917	3.3044175	0.0754	-0.0338640674644	1.05364767	1885	3105	1920.3618	3092.637	0.6530378	1.0431655	-0.6757	-0.198581839449	0.62601558	2588	3132	2602.6786	3119.2718	0.7790398	0.8905308	-0.1930	-0.161179962866	0.87480389	4669	4167	4641.2345	4132.0839	1.2852769	1.1294829	0.1864	0.0796425767009	1.137933910	9769	10012	9559.5924	9779.1545	3.9346276	3.8639524	0.0261	-0.033615723301	1.018290911	5998	7323	5955.7473	7160.9306	2.1317896	2.4305712	-0.1892	-0.331583178807	0.877073512	6440	7365	6383.7248	7202.0301	2.2972201	2.5250539	-0.1364	-0.296753195043	0.909770713	1065	1204	1108.432	1209.1172	0.5462871	0.5335056	0.0342	-0.0666083822258	1.023957414	6025	7157	5982.2857	6998.5043	1.6249905	1.9044851	-0.2290	-0.135445317491	0.85324415	1684	1721	1722.3733	1726.0698	0.5975094	0.5836094	0.0340	-0.00704519087098	1.023817316	1440	2077	1480.9928	2075.4163	0.5113796	0.6601857	-0.3685	-0.12290222225	0.774599517	597	544	604.5427	577.3405	0.1718984	0.1706407	0.0106	-0.194605374662	1.007370218	5915	5738	5873.9508	5645.8265	1.3438662	1.3191573	0.0268	-0.0611240303614	1.018730819	1534	1526	1573.6494	1532.8524	0.4939317	0.4729352	0.0627	-0.119050868586	1.04439620	2298	1827	2325.2828	1828.8038	0.9745742	0.7400504	0.3971	-0.00731684300279	1.3169024!sample_table_end
