Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481743/suppl/GSM481743_JBH499.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3415	3162	3364.0058	3171.7943	1.3176851	1.2360319	0.0923	-0.0375324439889	1.06606072	4047	4392	3948.2239	4378.6249	1.5106353	1.6515868	-0.1287	-0.210883524459	0.91465693	2088	2526	2073.9284	2544.6969	0.6996105	0.8624622	-0.3019	-0.28696355948	0.81117814	9159	10718	8692.6188	10592.489	3.2409581	4.1138624	-0.3441	-0.577890064299	0.78781395	16246	21949	15055.852	21547.908	5.4981458	8.1025607	-0.5594	-0.59730949295	0.67856896	6297	8732	6089.7432	8673.6142	2.0793207	3.0258684	-0.5412	-0.394164295578	0.68718147	1610	2397	1601.7642	2415.988	0.6794307	0.953767	-0.4893	-0.260385235377	0.71236558	1708	2542	1698.6906	2560.7009	0.6786542	1.0549869	-0.6365	-0.428945928011	0.64328219	5758	6604	5582.2169	6573.0883	1.9975644	2.2822472	-0.1922	-0.131269338228	0.87526210	7007	7761	6741.882	7726.0241	3.6295342	4.3485634	-0.2608	-0.151595525552	0.834651311	3211	8948	3161.7465	8881.1069	1.4815523	4.2930643	-1.5349	-1.07968748939	0.345103612	4835	7047	4711.5097	7015.6448	2.2833685	3.2226321	-0.4971	-0.561547449322	0.708541413	1542	2038	1534.8257	2063.1761	1.0293477	1.4067049	-0.4506	-0.299214822176	0.731743814	12742	17372	11941.903	17055.099	4.4424697	6.3530078	-0.5161	-0.47919360696	0.699270315	1255	1443	1243.0097	1478.7834	0.6063167	0.7021351	-0.2117	-0.115289684063	0.863532816	1958	2774	1950.9566	2794.507	0.8285131	1.152593	-0.4763	-0.30459186183	0.718825317	935	819	910.8266	874.6929	0.3712368	0.3494474	0.0873	0.107922965935	1.062353918	3824	5857	3740.2928	5827.2945	1.1269641	1.8274359	-0.6974	-0.491978077455	0.616691419	1423	1488	1412.3588	1522.5716	0.575074	0.6101674	-0.0855	-0.0725833818766	0.942485620	1805	1968	1797.7185	1994.8998	0.9181558	1.0392876	-0.1788	-0.220425001678	0.8834473!sample_table_end
