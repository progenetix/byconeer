Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481579/suppl/GSM481579_EL641.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3052	2657	3182.1835	2584.3116	0.7685987	0.6477653	0.2468	0.0304777627844	1.18653892	7090	6977	7224.1389	6614.8059	1.5989478	1.5477601	0.0469	-0.135992698202	1.03307213	1536	2199	1656.8958	2140.0997	0.4055193	0.5234725	-0.3683	-0.306554722075	0.77467174	18171	19926	17673.411	18715.077	4.072972	4.602369	-0.1763	-0.20700090991	0.88497295	16618	27167	16281.09	25745.875	4.3446317	6.755319	-0.6368	0.0208937178729	0.64314236	12579	9503	12550.361	8907.9709	3.3598648	2.4185713	0.4742	0.348251685266	1.3891947	2050	3133	2170.283	3036.0755	0.773814	1.0453862	-0.4340	0.0814845714776	0.74021838	3594	3389	3722.7912	3278.7161	0.8858347	0.8189926	0.1132	-0.0294880693101	1.08161519	7941	7152	8071.1851	6776.5554	1.6517687	1.4429984	0.1949	-0.0193602169557	1.144678110	12723	15249	12685.277	14224.895	3.4126213	3.8951916	-0.1908	-0.101994564094	0.876111211	13640	15544	13546.359	14501.002	3.351907	3.7213619	-0.1508	-0.299785786058	0.900720512	5474	7564	5630.4591	7145.2338	1.6872737	2.1302295	-0.3363	-0.306927750775	0.792061913	1294	1523	1409.7508	1485.3047	0.4193166	0.420454	-0.0039	-0.0593825900253	0.997294814	9032	11870	9140.9067	11119.131	2.278935	2.7114144	-0.2507	-0.280930069139	0.840496715	1681	2046	1799.9993	1989.6055	0.4494498	0.494058	-0.1365	-0.181055290786	0.909710516	1145	2064	1253.499	2007.6537	0.3874312	0.6185949	-0.6751	-0.379705611194	0.626308517	521	477	559.47546	490.40587	0.1315947	0.1211275	0.1196	0.191971272202	1.086414818	4881	5434	5031.5879	5191.0155	1.3181297	1.3139395	0.0046	-0.017879519715	1.00318919	1438	1501	1557.9798	1464.3677	0.3671427	0.3715096	-0.0171	-0.00932881403838	0.988245520	2966	2802	3091.9262	2720.1972	0.7629655	0.7081258	0.1076	-0.0823925730506	1.0774435!sample_table_end
