Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481832/suppl/GSM481832_MR154.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	10679	10952	10914.357	10587.782	1.3271794	1.2831316	-0.0487	-0.066661490108	0.96681092	10878	11338	11107.801	10960.074	1.3725667	1.359014	-0.0143	-0.0370802437611	0.9901263	6764	6038	6981.632	5798.4956	1.1367495	0.9570488	-0.2483	-0.146163357354	0.8419174	11315	9073	11548.446	8735.9001	2.0239729	1.5247247	-0.4086	-0.36994159993	0.75333265	18896	16302	19075.701	15871.681	3.1271489	2.5958619	-0.2686	-0.208991112737	0.83010496	12613	11407	12846.416	11027.142	2.0658068	1.7964957	-0.2015	-0.170873762702	0.86963397	3481	3504	3682.2663	3331.3745	0.6680466	0.6115111	-0.1276	-0.173648523816	0.9153728	2714	2755	2902.5884	2596.9934	0.5289017	0.493271	-0.1006	-0.140917055576	0.93263279	24918	22268	24906.611	21878.035	3.0059354	2.6748673	-0.1683	-0.0995134974376	0.889861810	17975	17705	18176.35	17269.705	3.7617086	3.604556	-0.0616	-0.156352974139	0.95822311	25459	23380	25426.932	23017.611	5.572298	5.2460026	-0.0871	-0.153083964616	0.941443312	9107	7433	9345.9225	7161.9004	1.959214	1.5722444	-0.3174	-0.328854936038	0.802487313	8787	10053	9018.7189	9711.2824	2.3062542	2.3241816	0.0112	-0.0941694012744	1.007773314	8987	8148	9223.228	7848.2227	2.9834978	2.4041345	-0.3115	-0.200340720701	0.805810715	7327	7200	7544.8417	6930.1947	1.5849196	1.5251561	-0.0555	-0.0109615269044	0.962292316	6350	6667	6566.8791	6405.887	1.2823334	1.2834317	0.0012	-0.102092425122	1.000856417	7976	7573	8195.5908	7300.8234	0.9606266	0.8681144	-0.1461	-0.134077591578	0.90369618	13048	13165	13273.749	12765.008	1.3593636	1.2650396	-0.1037	-0.178466788181	0.930611619	7811	7577	8030.6762	7304.7932	1.4678811	1.3531864	-0.1174	-0.0612339844734	0.921863720	3043	3058	3235.4969	2891.6073	0.6949718	0.6020954	-0.2070	-0.185184268091	0.8663594!sample_table_end
