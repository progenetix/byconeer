Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481811/suppl/GSM481811_MR063.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5693	5823	5495.94	5932.0755	1.5059426	1.5832275	-0.0722	-0.123261425352	0.95118532	2862	3432	2788.3615	3534.1025	0.8201968	0.9967674	-0.2813	-0.221370588172	0.82285683	3520	3148	3423.0641	3246.6799	0.8684645	0.8432704	0.0425	-0.206887358738	1.02987664	6266	8099	6035.8962	8232.573	1.5475674	2.1438877	-0.4702	-0.595890927295	0.7218515	11944	13467	11483.879	13730.019	2.8855095	3.6698462	-0.3469	-0.51529001996	0.78627536	9507	10098	9148.0143	10265.848	2.4518699	2.8184491	-0.2010	-0.245520921695	0.86993587	3823	4216	3709.9718	4307.4161	0.7378648	0.8357121	-0.1796	-0.207745683407	0.88291758	2283	2481	2237.4878	2570.6791	0.5828547	0.6642397	-0.1886	-0.126356014302	0.87747659	8034	8088	7733.44	8221.3299	2.1575601	2.2083914	-0.0336	0.024101768975	0.976982710	16287	16143	15632.723	16496.777	4.2971325	4.6578182	-0.1163	-0.0840508783718	0.922563411	23157	22290	22116.977	22869.065	6.0381791	6.3896555	-0.0816	-0.0508306632784	0.944992912	5247	7398	5070.7997	7517.2406	1.2378248	1.710756	-0.4668	-0.398574536	0.723554313	9512	9534	9152.7877	9688.0918	2.2050726	2.2187319	-0.0089	0.00936623606181	0.993843614	8058	9958	7756.3961	10121.709	2.1784671	2.8977237	-0.4116	-0.30119965284	0.751785715	5129	4762	4957.9758	4864.3802	1.2434682	1.2265282	0.0198	0.0301298129769	1.013811316	5268	6373	5090.8647	6484.8846	1.0872891	1.2662131	-0.2198	-0.015796071118	0.858693617	1933	1926	1903.5131	2009.8022	0.5509903	0.5538834	-0.0076	-0.047308152935	0.994776618	5856	6209	5650.6044	6319.6317	1.3968326	1.6711065	-0.2586	-0.171730859732	0.835872919	4259	4384	4123.3724	4475.1998	1.2138012	1.2359841	-0.0261	-0.0536656192381	0.982052520	2244	2068	2200.3769	2153.1782	0.5795748	0.5619075	0.0447	-0.0409282485387	1.0314418!sample_table_end
