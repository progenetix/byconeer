Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481511/suppl/GSM481511_DE430.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1935	1878	2073.1117	1744.234	0.6388358	0.5578901	0.1955	0.123045551825	1.14509242	4207	3006	4278.2549	2833.4916	1.5807631	1.1179579	0.4998	0.47133221697	1.41397373	2587	2380	2732.1462	2227.3198	0.8693784	0.7224785	0.2670	0.299019882351	1.20332784	12396	9193	10986.886	9748.7521	3.1781475	2.8149204	0.1751	0.190626110975	1.12903635	19212	12433	16028.308	13752.848	5.9575397	5.1098963	0.2214	0.197344191242	1.16588276	8517	9976	7975.875	10704.53	2.5875798	3.6519245	-0.4971	-0.526906330289	0.70855237	2130	3358	2274.4437	3182.9484	1.5294472	1.5785587	-0.0456	-0.265194149128	0.96888848	3395	3955	3518.9515	3793.5567	0.9678746	1.0142421	-0.0675	0.00977984421581	0.95428369	2412	2332	2558.6431	2181.0808	0.8909795	0.7946753	0.1650	0.0481000022081	1.121186910	5602	5443	5521.5562	5384.5476	2.3358997	2.3015202	0.0214	-0.109468090629	1.014937711	11534	8327	10331.86	8718.7963	3.958653	3.3367788	0.2466	0.120850095122	1.186369612	7634	9135	7264.0355	9678.2385	3.680992	3.7322237	-0.0199	0.235835977671	0.986273113	1396	2073	1528.162	1928.8314	0.8139617	0.876682	-0.1071	-0.0363234098333	0.928457114	8843	6305	8235.3214	6362.2339	3.6995769	2.9607464	0.3214	0.281506451628	1.249541915	1888	2224	2025.1374	2076.0933	0.751427	0.669736	0.1660	0.102628840494	1.121974816	1362	1852	1492.481	1720.0588	0.7885064	0.7286868	0.1138	0.179144374422	1.082092217	526	558	606.1479	512.6713	0.2237206	0.2031166	0.1394	-0.079373191821	1.101439118	3670	4377	3779.131	4238.4283	1.3107732	1.4850036	-0.1800	-0.206423005978	0.882673419	1366	1244	1496.6808	1148.5736	0.5290738	0.4299198	0.2994	0.0916608427668	1.230633720	1112	1161	1234.4691	1070.4877	0.4893804	0.4641303	0.0764	0.119296276559	1.0544029!sample_table_end
