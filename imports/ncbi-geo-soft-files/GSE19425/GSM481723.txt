Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481723/suppl/GSM481723_JBH221.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1236	2375	1715.0916	1845.5209	0.7022861	0.7014445	0.0017	-0.127320035789	1.00119972	3111	2506	3658.4851	1947.5129	1.849638	0.9015867	1.0367	1.04228410892	2.05153653	1980	1952	2541.9367	1535.8909	0.8457972	0.497504	0.7656	0.612626148391	1.70008114	10314	12500	9831.8675	10387.79	3.4719646	3.3180105	0.0654	0.0643655402636	1.04639955	17739	24393	15737.912	20643.915	4.4803598	6.1501184	-0.4570	-0.0324219318135	0.72849976	5558	8714	5841.99	7116.3659	1.9895309	2.4755748	-0.3153	-0.502289705599	0.80366427	1949	3155	2508.8745	2467.8459	0.7867628	0.8382863	-0.0915	0.261922260525	0.93853718	1234	4153	1712.8775	3293.9981	0.5930585	1.014438	-0.7744	-0.629885949562	0.58461779	1457	3708	1970.6312	2924.9045	0.9857287	1.3945616	-0.5005	-0.412314991906	0.706837710	6720	6186	6845.459	4978.5913	2.3453294	1.827784	0.3597	0.276873473981	1.283154611	6133	9374	6346.2782	7684.7407	2.1904225	2.4798859	-0.1791	-0.22996815909	0.883275512	5326	3157	5637.9171	2469.4739	1.6752279	0.8445747	0.9881	0.895792201361	1.983516413	1887	2527	2442.457	1964.2902	0.8500091	0.7988121	0.0896	-0.0233264472684	1.064091414	4975	6159	5333.0642	4955.5366	2.6132161	2.3136692	0.1756	0.329363824491	1.129468315	2614	2951	3201.3753	2302.5888	0.9518546	0.7893356	0.2701	0.281344661186	1.205893416	2757	3275	3340.4254	2564.9916	0.9924641	0.886697	0.1626	0.118437208092	1.119282117	496	754	758.1663	656.6419	0.3822211	0.3163215	0.2730	0.138133974865	1.20833118	3026	4692	3582.1235	3742.6299	1.2051848	1.1288054	0.0945	-0.00125716382145	1.067663919	955	1444	1385.6543	1168.8789	0.6950445	0.6019686	0.2074	0.00907179404934	1.154619120	1437	2167	1948.2624	1692.1834	0.7362857	0.5785755	0.3478	0.110994443044	1.2725836!sample_table_end
