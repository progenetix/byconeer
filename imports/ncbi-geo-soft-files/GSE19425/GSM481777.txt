Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481777/suppl/GSM481777_JBH551.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2029	1802	2063.5558	1753.111	0.9976951	0.79576	0.3263	0.169341650004	1.25376382	1710	2394	1746.6735	2325.8239	0.9921777	1.1244839	-0.1806	-0.15327020774	0.88234053	1114	1193	1147.7042	1169.1246	0.5938195	0.5760556	0.0438	0.186980193024	1.03083724	8438	5752	8280.4706	5543.7802	3.8611774	2.898608	0.4137	0.049138076429	1.33207985	8964	10363	8775.2869	10001.775	5.0189467	6.1128356	-0.2845	0.00590654886412	0.82105056	5855	6007	5792.2777	5791.2172	3.2951566	3.1439836	0.0678	-0.0496395549905	1.04808327	1459	1418	1495.0473	1384.9679	1.0220288	1.0283514	-0.0089	0.0139535678972	0.99385178	1816	1583	1851.7557	1544.0462	0.8439091	0.8031454	0.0714	-0.200438141897	1.05075519	2297	2494	2327.4303	2421.5529	1.2704721	1.1138213	0.1898	-0.0668924528107	1.140642610	5792	5440	5731.4602	5245.4529	3.2776382	3.2127421	0.0289	0.134225540603	1.020199511	9258	8184	9052.9206	7901.2953	4.6243937	4.6078245	0.0052	0.039607702434	1.003595812	4074	2980	4083.4179	2889.5866	2.431026	1.9425742	0.3236	0.189284375981	1.251445613	1119	1156	1152.6198	1133.623	0.9333818	0.9193102	0.0219	0.149974811645	1.015306714	4517	5997	4508.3811	5781.516	3.5825344	3.2146016	0.1563	-0.00975278899901	1.114456715	1331	1202	1365.6725	1177.7566	0.7490888	0.7389037	0.0198	0.130795684944	1.01378416	1332	1525	1366.7031	1487.8055	0.8331532	0.9258037	-0.1521	0.15679280172	0.899924217	470	629	489.62778	634.85571	0.2605478	0.3093376	-0.2476	-0.0523238799472	0.842276318	2210	2717	2242.0706	2634.7724	1.4383733	1.5069035	-0.0671	-0.0301931208676	0.954522519	1040	1272	1073.9772	1245.2753	0.5589034	0.616128	-0.1406	0.14128275854	0.907122220	1676	1372	1712.8236	1341.1311	0.9350396	0.7060995	0.4052	0.124816450948	1.3242321!sample_table_end
