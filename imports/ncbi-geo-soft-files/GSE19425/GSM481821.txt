Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481821/suppl/GSM481821_MR079.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6898	5706	6569.9171	5951.2392	1.3116243	1.1013281	0.2521	0.271705103961	1.19094772	4764	5100	4566.1468	5354.2487	0.988867	1.0214982	-0.0468	-0.0906209138713	0.96805553	4717	4840	4522.1132	5106.5317	0.8640318	0.9143358	-0.0816	-0.16886073204	0.94498294	11701	12503	11002.614	12316.01	2.0325268	2.2650077	-0.1562	-0.18565899682	0.89735975	16463	18074	15298.943	17836.367	2.9620253	3.3024563	-0.1570	-0.286374298321	0.89691586	10890	11674	10284.368	11526.418	2.0427897	2.1912056	-0.1012	-0.236371990765	0.93226747	3896	3838	3764.473	4074.8362	0.7256763	0.8001936	-0.1410	-0.318013589902	0.90687598	5134	4305	4908.6045	4567.3271	0.8713013	0.824544	0.0796	0.0742537305717	1.05670689	9937	8454	9394.0064	8521.5459	2.0276059	1.5777558	0.3619	0.330576985724	1.285120210	17392	15755	16106.133	15501.515	2.8256629	2.8146383	0.0056	0.0735777304862	1.003916811	16415	19230	15254.697	19030.058	2.7245527	3.4478839	-0.3397	-0.37488799599	0.790210112	7706	9476	7314.2387	9469.4183	1.2787231	1.8887598	-0.5627	-0.351240691286	0.677017313	11419	8610	10757.562	8666.2637	1.6476139	1.571597	0.0681	0.0485425514103	1.048369214	11024	13401	10406.887	13183.282	2.4203481	2.5908924	-0.0982	-0.204459463406	0.934175415	7696	5528	7305.1763	5770.8019	1.2537943	1.1094024	0.1765	0.231192144081	1.130152816	5802	5318	5537.5874	5564.0557	0.9928724	1.1105073	-0.1615	0.0598875366593	0.89407117	2797	2950	2774.3033	3183.4735	0.6007585	0.6111309	-0.0247	-0.0133125161485	0.983027418	7292	8370	6939.6059	8443.5386	1.2781491	1.470022	-0.2018	-0.164135315893	0.869476219	5502	5288	5252.5763	5534.7522	1.1950215	1.0977797	0.1224	0.142005438967	1.088580520	6157	5011	5859.1917	5270.0224	0.9533467	0.8876006	0.1031	0.168947613238	1.0740717!sample_table_end
