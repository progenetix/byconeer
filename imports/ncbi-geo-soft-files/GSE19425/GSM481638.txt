Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9775!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481638/suppl/GSM481638_JA695.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	842	1545	1107.2693	1255.2312	0.5418139	0.6256608	0.2076	0.280586509044	1.1547522	2807	4358	3234.3122	3796.6765	0.8210672	0.9028742	0.1370	0.111202021202	1.09963493	4102	6493	4500.8676	5884.1213	1.1836447	1.5027185	0.3443	0.324111835787	1.26956884	4873	4629	5219.6838	4050.7326	2.930329	2.2091566	-0.4076	-0.48852356063	0.75389365	20529	15150	18577.69	14552.025	4.7707933	3.5940971	-0.4086	-0.546543801488	0.75335426	8725	11979	8680.7226	11376.942	2.0649393	2.4782086	0.2632	0.317830799036	1.20013627	2531	7199	2956.0229	6570.2743	0.7018463	1.4330633	1.0299	0.989916254326	2.04184768	3183	5071	3616.0314	4485.5571	0.964136	1.1192737	0.2153	0.203670386661	1.16090859	5403	9432	5707.5966	8828.3204	1.3517956	1.9703824	0.5436	0.784536396091	1.457603710	5485	6212	5784.1853	5606.353	2.9648031	3.0680624	0.0494	-0.0235559715469	1.034828311	6035	6095	6283.6097	5489.7744	3.0695245	2.8364704	-0.1139	0.0849047300472	0.924074812	3901	4167	4306.5453	3622.0679	1.7551013	1.5525665	-0.1769	-0.301501208244	0.884602213	1725	2415	2100.9694	2009.6977	1.1078523	1.0695526	-0.0508	0.0394183408474	0.965428914	5920	4951	6178.1318	4365.9864	2.7683035	1.9740285	-0.4879	-0.285262337424	0.713082315	1093	1760	1399.5573	1439.2278	0.5571855	0.609852	0.1303	0.0619767441746	1.094522216	2743	4055	3171.1077	3520.8044	1.5667454	1.6028089	0.0328	-0.0161556991482	1.02301817	982	1359	1271.9978	1099.0407	0.3696095	0.312601	-0.2417	-0.2177784104	0.845760118	4405	7248	4788.5723	6620.0439	1.3386633	1.868577	0.4811	0.514116603027	1.395852819	1832	2816	2217.9604	2371.5949	0.68052	0.7426454	0.1260	0.25361030486	1.091291120	3423	4952	3852.2604	4366.9817	0.9840136	1.0799968	0.1343	0.0913716238766	1.0975425!sample_table_end
