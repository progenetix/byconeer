Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481717/suppl/GSM481717_JBH215.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2460	2225	2540.6328	2182.605	0.857432	0.7172043	0.2576	0.288242314979	1.19551972	3264	3032	3339.9094	2972.6613	1.5353203	1.3116268	0.2272	0.0618336969091	1.17054653	3499	2432	3571.331	2384.0034	0.8869356	0.5915209	0.5844	0.277310181744	1.49941534	14848	15797	14544.977	15719.162	3.6170987	3.9448029	-0.1251	-0.173288056867	0.91692765	21075	25446	20305.378	25503.529	4.2631323	5.3191608	-0.3193	-0.300620808267	0.8014676	7736	9597	7719.1306	9491.9225	2.0945695	2.6022964	-0.3131	-0.256748269718	0.80489277	4068	5736	4130.0195	5652.7549	0.6838588	0.8838499	-0.3701	-0.193018627679	0.77372738	2851	3115	2928.2104	3053.7164	0.6650477	0.7306528	-0.1357	-0.0137340806369	0.91021039	1900	2171	1974.6109	2129.8999	0.8883048	0.9079707	-0.0316	-0.0327801205133	0.978340710	12876	11834	12663.158	11734.134	2.5771889	2.5651117	0.0068	-0.0747273968344	1.004708211	17086	14145	16638.757	14058.526	3.4384105	3.0622015	0.1672	0.141455418698	1.122855712	8353	8211	8324.5812	8117.4702	1.494355	1.467357	0.0263	0.282830480776	1.01839913	5637	4416	5669.048	4329.5072	1.0562063	0.7586486	0.4774	0.206760985098	1.392220714	4943	5493	4997.5288	5409.4538	2.4026179	2.4939487	-0.0538	-0.0443146141747	0.96337915	6374	4729	6376.9464	4643.1426	1.1364178	0.8683537	0.3881	0.192641110526	1.308703716	6130	6222	6142.2075	6133.2752	1.0533453	1.0064823	0.0657	-0.0369269862045	1.046561117	1641	831	1714.955	861.1037	0.7394768	0.3694535	1.0011	0.514060232421	2.001542518	4231	4992	4289.1012	4910.557	1.0174542	1.1435246	-0.1685	-0.0976262015178	0.889752819	2028	1768	2104.4405	1738.2568	0.8451192	0.6841977	0.3047	0.113301369444	1.235197320	3679	3384	3747.9984	3318.374	0.8119672	0.7538433	0.1072	0.0661964024016	1.0771034!sample_table_end
