Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481724/suppl/GSM481724_JBH222.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2227	1647	2014.4738	2019.6974	0.838772	0.7022131	-0.2564	-0.127320035789	0.83719172	1582	3388	1447.6849	3638.0479	0.7517565	1.5542308	1.0479	1.04228410892	2.06746573	2061	2521	1864.0789	2884.4889	0.5613963	0.772036	0.4596	0.612626148391	1.37520684	13377	17171	12038.664	14647.539	3.9664287	4.1443271	0.0633	0.0643655402636	1.0448515	14399	21012	12925.434	17727.513	3.6400696	4.7770557	0.3922	-0.0324219318135	1.31235286	11422	7914	10350.016	7229.7561	3.4068629	2.1128637	-0.6892	-0.502289705599	0.62017867	2060	3342	1863.1699	3595.9446	0.6136332	0.9400487	0.6154	0.261922260525	1.5319398	3974	2253	3602.6346	2622.5139	1.035242	0.7395043	-0.4853	-0.629885949562	0.71432999	2887	2094	2590.3075	2466.5671	1.2162037	0.9715121	-0.3241	-0.412314991906	0.79880710	15191	14201	13606.214	12271.704	3.133079	3.5841552	0.1941	0.276873473981	1.143972111	8727	6086	7964.3596	5809.5492	2.0187985	1.66166	-0.2809	-0.22996815909	0.823093512	4473	6710	4069.2441	6277.3147	0.9213092	1.6080157	0.8035	0.895792201361	1.745359413	3800	2054	3448.2373	2427.3923	0.8373536	0.7618791	-0.1363	-0.0233264472684	0.909865414	3316	4802	3014.5581	4811.9331	1.6659369	2.3285267	0.4831	0.329363824491	1.397727915	2790	2399	2499.5688	2765.222	0.5457635	0.6684699	0.2926	0.281344661186	1.224834416	4715	4038	4280.5444	4204.5663	1.0041124	1.0571802	0.0743	0.118437208092	1.052850517	614	507	533.9489	673.2055	0.2803073	0.2809399	0.0033	0.138133974865	1.002256718	5913	4537	5397.0455	4608.1475	1.425589	1.3329163	-0.0970	-0.00125716382145	0.934993419	1681	1260	1537.1137	1596.7868	0.7148119	0.6269238	-0.1893	0.00907179404934	0.877047220	3624	2107	3290.9053	2479.417	0.8299157	0.7606291	-0.1258	0.110994443044	0.9165137!sample_table_end
