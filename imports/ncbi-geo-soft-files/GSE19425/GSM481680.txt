Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481680/suppl/GSM481680_JA944.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	728	483	649.3211	545.8782	0.6941863	0.5602854	-0.3092	-0.0665044686737	0.8071112	965	763	866.283	852.7533	1.1587604	1.1218379	-0.0467	0.11094862222	0.96813623	1323	1008	1196.2506	1113.5362	0.9616003	0.8857295	-0.1186	0.0599835853851	0.92109944	5731	4746	5311.8318	5055.1411	4.3153144	4.0012047	-0.1090	-0.0167743500374	0.92721045	9056	9410	8399.8631	9946.4912	5.8082809	6.9682146	0.2627	0.0506377936759	1.19970346	5307	4470	4916.1283	4767.1066	4.2391316	4.0774769	-0.0561	0.0240103957814	0.9618667	1914	1748	1746.6285	1898.7429	1.4728147	1.6795707	0.1895	0.071015733728	1.14038158	1736	1527	1581.4229	1664.2272	1.2825648	1.2786986	-0.0044	0.0107178337531	0.99698559	804	633	718.3588	711.1803	0.9255522	0.905624	-0.0314	-0.182704527294	0.978468710	2822	2688	2591.8816	2890.8904	2.1238759	2.2524068	0.0848	0.0155372472452	1.060517111	5246	3422	4859.1178	3665.3718	3.8902886	2.828782	-0.4597	-0.223758345372	0.727139312	3385	3443	3121.0303	3687.5095	2.1141712	2.5606419	0.2764	0.213211887589	1.2111813	1365	1243	1235.5815	1360.6098	0.9257464	1.0385907	0.1659	0.0630467300461	1.121895514	2198	2380	2009.5291	2564.33	3.0844233	3.8647858	0.3254	0.0718506559149	1.25300115	2063	1825	1884.3918	1980.5083	1.1700771	1.228143	0.0699	0.132279653074	1.049625716	1064	917	958.0081	1016.6922	0.6487459	0.7178164	0.1460	0.0247535573219	1.106467717	474	316	421.7707	363.518	0.5311024	0.4514043	-0.2346	-0.136168582494	0.849938318	1715	1072	1561.8969	1180.6964	1.4383988	1.0712162	-0.4252	-0.224562476127	0.744728219	662	533	588.8309	600.922	0.7292931	0.7457204	0.0321	0.0316474341102	1.02252520	609	512	541.3298	577.9115	0.4676632	0.4705348	0.0088	0.135060941794	1.0061402!sample_table_end
