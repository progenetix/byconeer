Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481732/suppl/GSM481732_JBH404.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4335	3723	4041.9382	3951.9948	1.0320662	1.0745432	0.0582	-0.0503548698338	1.04115722	6138	3904	5768.0288	4133.4397	1.8409177	1.3164588	-0.4838	-0.245841903623	0.715113	4923	4140	4605.2962	4368.4604	1.1921172	1.1003448	-0.1156	0.0242077489551	0.92301734	24357	18446	22684.671	18756.709	5.5032313	4.757208	-0.2102	0.0421376243593	0.8644395	31632	27561	29231.492	27928.019	8.0271193	7.4978312	-0.0984	-0.104090240415	0.93406256	13467	15060	12723.867	15320.011	3.5065823	4.0952585	0.2239	0.187038742236	1.16787747	2255	2884	2068.2065	3100.859	0.963965	1.2399861	0.3633	0.307619123219	1.28633928	4359	3886	4065.625	4115.4131	1.0196886	1.0705104	0.0702	0.122290113736	1.04984049	2943	3109	2706.6105	3326.1238	0.8729409	1.0282767	0.2363	0.0460754091597	1.177945410	16784	12068	15780.881	12288.158	4.2612701	3.4447198	-0.3069	-0.13390815158	0.808378611	17476	16851	16415.468	17145.446	4.2597348	4.5829063	0.1055	0.0160960466491	1.075866512	13990	15700	13210.442	15967.921	4.227317	5.5490557	0.3925	0.334923013757	1.31266613	2782	3661	2554.6663	3889.5896	1.3121708	1.717979	0.3888	0.192383692025	1.309264714	14781	14683	13935.188	14942.021	4.7455632	4.7905458	0.0136	-0.0391363626659	1.009478815	2847	2671	2615.8135	2890.6092	0.7171346	0.8410906	0.2300	0.193304959987	1.172848916	2346	2235	2151.2622	2445.7226	0.8051814	0.9536307	0.2441	0.150673008167	1.184367517	1666	1356	1525.2209	1519.0305	0.4837995	0.4790305	-0.0143	0.11217646451	0.990142618	5185	4689	4853.2871	4931.3657	1.4554582	1.3789507	-0.0779	-0.106921618375	0.947434119	3190	2340	2937.3507	2553.938	0.8627191	0.8442185	-0.0313	-0.120576214065	0.978555420	2671	2359	2450.9727	2573.5736	0.6768127	0.7707201	0.1875	0.135571117265	1.1387495!sample_table_end
