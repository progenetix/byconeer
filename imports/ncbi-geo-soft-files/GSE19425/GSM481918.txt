Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481918/suppl/GSM481918_MR332.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	7368	5156	6965.2255	5403.7356	1.4311286	1.1101367	-0.3664	0.0681289846824	0.77570722	6283	6022	5947.8746	6288.9393	1.279881	1.3727898	0.1011	0.0410534145112	1.07259173	5126	3847	4854.5369	4054.6748	1.0139995	0.8227415	-0.3015	0.148819074695	0.81138264	15300	13578	14264.25	14138.904	2.8900787	2.861029	-0.0146	-0.023487035644	0.98994855	19300	17375	17919.809	18178.291	4.0210017	3.8669545	-0.0564	-0.0715512344067	0.96168936	13002	13275	12165.515	13817.595	2.6965044	2.9707629	0.1397	0.106566348996	1.10170897	3309	3905	3138.8265	4113.7651	0.8142682	1.0286768	0.3372	0.0578020909057	1.26331448	4170	4062	3956.8861	4275.9013	0.7789261	0.8763886	0.1701	0.0232804794637	1.12512429	9407	9346	8869.1727	9712.6995	1.7966903	1.9975004	0.1529	-0.0732762115034	1.111766610	13265	11368	12405.707	11823.798	2.8506253	2.8468013	-0.0019	-0.1103039141	0.998658511	21995	16609	20380.847	17344.738	4.4032101	3.9837066	-0.1444	-0.0429130661174	0.904727812	9576	10009	9026.024	10402.194	2.2949436	2.6897933	0.2290	-0.107160096659	1.17205213	5015	4550	4750.5144	4776.6132	1.3426304	1.3669509	0.0259	-0.0337749652386	1.018114114	14847	15420	13845.903	16085.763	3.1593388	3.5114745	0.1525	-0.118149318296	1.111458715	5046	4166	4779.5706	4383.8269	1.1407229	1.0495408	-0.1202	0.0523488357933	0.920066416	3763	4065	3567.2871	4279.0179	0.8701817	1.0519451	0.2737	-0.0783927039657	1.208879817	2911	2699	2764.7777	2875.62	0.5895547	0.6192408	0.0709	0.190384769137	1.050353518	7534	8576	7117.9338	8917.4653	1.5191713	1.739989	0.1958	0.125312802247	1.145354119	4074	3070	3864.9301	3258.8369	0.8437964	0.7298469	-0.2093	-0.036942808546	0.864956320	4000	2569	3794.1175	2740.9529	0.7637995	0.5890202	-0.3749	-0.154329085074	0.7711713!sample_table_end
