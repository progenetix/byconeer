Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481646/suppl/GSM481646_JA800.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1196	2073	1530.3846	1643.9751	0.9298839	0.8289721	-0.1657	-0.209047844984	0.89147912	1425	2806	1744.1392	2167.6799	1.4179281	1.1664174	-0.2817	0.0589955281874	0.8226213	1255	1883	1586.3139	1507.6672	0.6755095	0.7314066	0.1147	-0.0835309225654	1.08274814	7299	6869	7056.3478	5225.7504	3.0213326	2.714182	-0.1547	0.110232800191	0.89833935	15672	11791	13945.531	9242.4231	5.5254538	4.7746225	-0.2107	0.0261231261159	0.8641146	6131	11460	6045.7013	8964.8409	2.7032528	4.5225668	0.7424	0.774321864998	1.67300917	2400	3746	2729.9702	2853.2703	1.2402639	1.3056983	0.0742	0.628413307983	1.05275848	1943	2317	2286.394	1822.323	1.0148023	1.0080311	-0.0097	0.381900193514	0.99332769	1734	3284	2072.4584	2517.9386	1.7391571	1.2948182	-0.4256	-0.139560980617	0.74450910	3267	5286	3516.7976	4007.5511	1.9187747	2.7231549	0.5051	0.0618974134332	1.419215511	7518	7645	7241.3004	5845.947	3.5733248	3.7926734	0.0859	-0.07811962512	1.06138512	3025	4851	3297.9744	3675.9121	1.5945708	1.796474	0.1720	0.0184272258423	1.126619213	1089	2475	1417.3485	1930.7417	1.0302112	1.2159008	0.2391	-0.300004380665	1.180244214	4405	6946	4526.9373	5287.0776	3.4174362	2.7824793	-0.2965	-0.0489496532361	0.814200815	2260	4173	2595.2665	3156.119	1.1097954	1.5404426	0.4731	0.0476757418687	1.388041916	1436	2430	1755.4089	1899.7237	0.7968494	0.8766527	0.1377	-0.217416426649	1.100148517	625	1285	898.4732	1089.4775	0.6913369	0.5811962	-0.2504	-0.253406771681	0.840684418	2352	4176	2685.5296	3158.3772	1.2783476	1.5085865	0.2389	-0.04533172445	1.180106619	543	1894	792.862	1515.4378	0.6990843	0.8411352	0.2669	-0.231514109889	1.203195720	961	769	1268.8726	727.7584	0.7390476	0.4362574	-0.7605	-0.364996534798	0.5902967!sample_table_end
