Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481699/suppl/GSM481699_JBH099.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	603	742	654.14018	705.93428	1.0707619	1.0175959	0.0735	0.129491145728	1.05224662	617	673	666.33746	638.01489	1.3667524	1.1765083	0.2162	0.243241448601	1.16170233	631	857	678.95317	813.70251	0.9841638	1.0080324	-0.0346	-0.111663679167	0.97632164	3207	2921	3078.0867	2836.3114	3.0463572	2.8849512	0.0785	-0.00788259630431	1.05594755	3357	4224	3218.0947	4124.1392	5.2704393	5.4426448	-0.0464	0.0154106453996	0.968366	1865	2138	1824.9734	2062.4521	2.9295248	2.7989181	0.0658	0.142511988715	1.04666337	1236	1239	1235.3029	1188.4539	1.1400278	0.9295872	0.2944	0.168251916071	1.22638078	1433	1052	1422.7927	1001.6565	0.9348242	0.77779	0.2653	0.212816085522	1.2018989	749	887	789.52767	842.66533	1.5499125	1.4995602	0.0476	0.046019374432	1.03357810	6142	5613	5804.6812	5550.1705	3.0263421	3.5058334	-0.2122	-0.0150754365142	0.863230411	10456	8442	9696.4569	8494.6157	5.3589775	5.740194	-0.0991	-0.0591781534406	0.933588212	3071	3000	2951.5186	2915.2954	1.659047	1.8329656	-0.1438	-0.106958720694	0.905116313	2835	2956	2732.1201	2871.2971	1.3440727	1.6092174	-0.2597	-0.121064603292	0.835233814	690	1233	733.23726	1182.7023	2.440178	2.9200873	-0.2590	-0.0303373402428	0.835652415	3046	2584	2928.2886	2496.948	1.5237955	1.5070269	0.0160	0.0540731369423	1.01112716	1409	1730	1400.1834	1662.3316	0.9007616	1.0939113	-0.2803	-0.0469556098862	0.823432117	276	357	321.02919	340.01103	0.6167145	0.5859329	0.0739	-0.0876508141173	1.052534418	426	842	485.91918	799.22757	1.2346412	1.4271755	-0.2091	-0.149919151533	0.865094119	500	741	557.07986	704.95508	0.8357385	1.0662115	-0.3514	-0.216455944227	0.783839320	1082	728	1091.9817	692.22449	0.6537636	0.5073967	0.3657	-0.0392807672687	1.2884662!sample_table_end
