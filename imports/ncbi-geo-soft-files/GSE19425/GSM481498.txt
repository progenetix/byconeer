Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481498/suppl/GSM481498_DE405.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1275	1503	1158.5638	1670.9926	1.1516062	1.3611039	0.2411	0.0178072002759	1.18191782	998	1068	944.25	1180.0508	1.2890645	1.1285498	-0.1919	-0.115264290143	0.87547973	1964	1836	1660.9855	2037.4647	0.9804678	1.2999569	0.4069	0.192637070963	1.32585384	3255	2332	2517.396	2584.5445	1.9518353	1.9779149	0.0191	0.17345317068	1.01336155	14595	6325	9754.9087	7451.7165	4.5656293	4.5109139	-0.0174	-0.0869131087713	0.98801586	7583	4618	5367.5157	5339.1862	3.3354838	3.5427605	0.0870	-0.0924229679916	1.06214297	3036	1320	2378.417	1469.2336	1.0187015	0.9825269	-0.0522	-0.0422667058654	0.96448958	946	689	905.3456	781.6209	0.7649378	0.5990836	-0.3526	-0.211996956286	0.78317949	1167	1510	1072.3597	1678.3248	1.4229736	1.5970303	0.1665	0.135326560291	1.12231910	2731	4096	2174.3104	4710.8583	2.6061975	4.500445	0.7881	0.107185148122	1.726824211	5354	7472	3906.1054	8944.1066	3.8794371	8.0222288	1.0482	0.232242253142	2.067884712	2755	1735	2190.7557	1919.4005	1.3209787	1.5083135	0.1913	0.230095514437	1.141815213	1552	1824	1357.9976	2023.4231	1.4040933	2.3210022	0.7251	-0.0361156170968	1.653025614	2415	2992	1962.5946	3369.6859	2.0815169	2.7759259	0.4153	0.0833778686622	1.333607215	2295	2161	1883.1234	2391.5579	1.3585244	1.792602	0.4000	0.14004135166	1.319521416	2904	1787	2292.5436	1980.1608	1.1197946	1.3805812	0.3020	0.423891684429	1.232887917	750	842	733.4069	944.2265	0.971563	0.8716739	-0.1565	-0.0926217712492	0.897187318	4318	2828	3213.9695	3167.5653	1.2650648	1.6804331	0.4096	0.0445233790434	1.328337519	636	1139	627.2252	1258.9921	1.014474	1.3006454	0.3585	-0.0684302906582	1.282088520	558	631	549.572	723.0552	0.8033869	0.7284098	-0.1413	0.162320522669	0.9066737!sample_table_end
