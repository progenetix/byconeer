Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481924/suppl/GSM481924_MR348.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3754	2672	3511.8776	2869.5452	1.2454763	0.993242	-0.3265	0.0524124160972	0.79747972	2391	2345	2197.5322	2539.0076	0.902764	1.0458217	0.2122	0.00384340922798	1.15846643	4264	2772	4012.714	2972.0603	1.407618	1.02871	-0.4524	0.0385770728411	0.73081624	29040	26444	27255.114	27228.381	7.3453574	7.4825502	0.0267	-0.112996127671	1.01867755	15676	15190	15002.491	15460.914	6.1626034	6.2024974	0.0093	-0.0998059929427	1.00647366	9837	10116	9466.6372	10282.878	3.6147934	3.8882484	0.1052	0.0476206067765	1.07564897	2370	2692	2177.4417	2890.0937	1.0524321	1.3156994	0.3221	0.11366729813	1.25015148	3719	3190	3477.1618	3382.897	0.9178959	0.9351573	0.0269	-0.0007203154479	1.01880559	4791	2854	4526.2855	3054.2435	1.7110304	1.1559448	-0.5658	0.0183389112693	0.67558410	12627	10557	12136.776	10730.481	3.4139007	3.1384015	-0.1214	-0.0825038699572	0.919300811	13255	13009	12734.647	13208.489	3.5156905	3.8397654	0.1272	-0.129139090498	1.092179612	10417	11478	10022.332	11657.017	3.4988433	3.9751027	0.1841	-0.308523222432	1.136119113	3739	3037	3496.9953	3234.1272	1.3188056	1.1564833	-0.1895	0.0208243249518	0.876917214	11982	10751	11521.407	10926.407	5.4733638	5.0969316	-0.1028	-0.183907523206	0.931224715	3853	3060	3610.1771	3256.4323	1.0807	0.9612225	-0.1690	0.0622535383627	0.889444316	2479	2331	2281.5824	2524.8927	0.8380373	0.9095707	0.1182	0.0197635345276	1.085358217	1912	1275	1740.1186	1436.2744	0.7259104	0.5975786	-0.2807	0.178163268588	0.823212618	4268	3636	4016.5809	3824.218	1.8157564	1.6413055	-0.1457	-0.00406086593383	0.903923919	2773	1901	2563.4497	2087.1568	0.7729488	0.6520546	-0.2454	0.112109190592	0.843593520	4213	3041	3963.4689	3238.0065	0.7588958	0.6606928	-0.1999	-0.0836540944978	0.8705976!sample_table_end
