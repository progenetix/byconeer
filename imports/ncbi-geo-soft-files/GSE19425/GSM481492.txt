Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481492/suppl/GSM481492_DE399.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2238	1436	1639.1908	1909.4558	1.2384605	1.575157	0.3469	0.296766793736	1.2718672	1359	735	1022.4221	975.6797	0.9242997	0.8419819	-0.1346	-0.100554313002	0.91094043	2514	1294	1824.6568	1716.8516	1.335823	1.5193851	0.1858	0.299926977349	1.1374154	4308	1451	3049.2203	1930.391	2.3493174	1.7511904	-0.4239	-0.234741242136	0.74540395	8741	2594	6160.5753	3416.9877	5.2805576	3.4879586	-0.5983	-0.509727454812	0.66052856	6480	2717	4574.4499	3573.4364	3.3847804	3.180013	-0.0900	-0.0449541830842	0.93950357	1178	711	892.8161	945.3343	1.1001555	1.0025839	-0.1340	0.201168360113	0.91131118	1154	540	875.3751	719.9849	0.6846517	0.6073164	-0.1729	-0.237993831626	0.88704439	2172	1313	1593.5951	1741.8777	1.4622559	1.4274449	-0.0348	0.147335356998	0.976193610	4864	3394	3436.1765	4449.3516	2.893742	3.5516339	0.2955	0.237411609372	1.227349911	9422	6446	6632.3728	8454.5615	5.4192299	7.0974135	0.3892	0.27140774688	1.30967212	1821	1071	1349.6861	1427.1461	1.5607872	1.4151219	-0.1413	-0.137919811422	0.906671913	1636	1818	1220.2279	2419.0728	1.7398863	2.5478432	0.5503	0.276566699415	1.464373414	4509	2140	3188.271	2834.2348	3.0670985	2.6113351	-0.2321	-0.0698338594706	0.851402415	2231	1707	1634.5592	2276.5302	1.5845893	1.9805796	0.3218	0.296934614541	1.249900916	1335	1060	1005.6033	1412.2988	1.1383963	1.3627192	0.2595	0.237031450445	1.197051717	1356	918	1020.3211	1218.2402	0.9163711	1.0261945	0.1633	0.169515730963	1.11984618	2963	1590	2129.1749	2121.2442	1.4894861	1.791048	0.2660	0.0327931706413	1.202460319	1686	1400	1255.5036	1859.4289	1.2049466	1.5972573	0.4066	0.342224526221	1.325583520	1079	639	820.009	852.8688	0.6703608	0.6854936	0.0322	0.361942145988	1.0225741!sample_table_end
