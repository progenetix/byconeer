Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481701/suppl/GSM481701_JBH105.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	498	671	547.19842	624.75723	0.9516242	0.9982649	-0.0690	-0.0469898602166	0.95327822	494	588	543.00507	546.7446	1.4209324	1.1296001	0.3310	0.345354587161	1.25790743	883	1050	939.59907	985.01493	0.9537193	1.0349893	-0.1180	-0.109710197019	0.92147754	3054	2883	3098.6418	2750.6364	3.0347865	3.0104601	0.0116	0.0073411990685	1.00808065	7324	6793	7205.0871	6621.6477	6.2530707	5.7865571	0.1119	-0.0273115656552	1.08062026	2303	2440	2354.0581	2317.0369	2.6187094	2.680949	-0.0339	-0.0456423848485	0.97678457	1396	1534	1457.5573	1449.196	0.8549002	0.8448278	0.0171	-0.30640704692	1.01192248	979	940	1034.9591	878.72999	0.8001535	0.7795335	0.0377	-0.152383534194	1.02645179	631	913	682.25468	852.78462	1.748864	1.6786203	0.0591	-0.0545607109572	1.041846110	5521	5877	5483.4744	5703.4231	3.3518097	3.9191968	-0.2256	0.0269749423265	0.855228711	8296	8244	8134.5657	8078.5932	5.2955993	6.1140802	-0.2073	-0.22439058094	0.866131812	2859	3061	2906.4912	2922.8452	1.5648671	1.7949774	-0.1979	-0.0160035541581	0.871803213	2382	3276	2433.704	3130.8053	1.3248368	1.7916282	-0.4355	-0.0913676344611	0.739459714	625	1359	676.19719	1278.6884	2.4362284	3.1493242	-0.3704	-0.0222675277937	0.773571815	2358	2405	2409.5314	2282.7903	1.4396484	1.5711493	-0.1261	-0.0167904637503	0.916302816	1819	2135	1875.0673	2021.2851	0.9479254	1.1158004	-0.2352	-0.0164027336886	0.849547517	213	364	241.77984	337.09956	0.5656093	0.6542717	-0.2101	0.0592382788888	0.864486918	858	1497	913.87666	1412.8612	1.4764797	1.7693417	-0.2611	-0.10549145174	0.834479719	329	650	372.24858	605.2113	0.7900146	1.0873673	-0.4609	-0.211558937759	0.726538920	832	812	886.95657	756.93741	0.6328138	0.559794	0.1769	-0.101891786194	1.1304405!sample_table_end
