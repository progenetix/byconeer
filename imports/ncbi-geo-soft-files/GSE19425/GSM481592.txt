Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481592/suppl/GSM481592_EL654.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2385	2134	2499.0694	2020.7002	0.9978377	0.7797492	-0.3558	-0.14748169438	0.78143882	2531	1927	2650.8562	1827.7498	1.27733	0.851455	-0.5851	-0.248495419479	0.66658973	829	1163	898.89913	1105.4835	0.3494331	0.4202989	0.2664	0.112982839919	1.20280224	10328	10080	10349.966	9680.6663	4.1757299	4.0503641	-0.0440	-0.107032462056	0.96997755	12233	19457	12156.573	19164.868	5.3305693	8.1544059	0.6133	-0.0420042265244	1.52974396	9171	9888	9235.709	9491.4065	3.9876204	4.0070873	0.0070	-0.0852748679496	1.00488187	2565	2954	2686.1801	2801.8896	1.2561247	1.2789603	0.0260	-0.0688898236165	1.01817948	1942	2146	2048.2686	2031.887	0.7717248	0.7888054	0.0316	-0.130315639221	1.02213299	3758	3143	3904.1055	2981.6375	1.8442809	1.3584604	-0.4411	-0.177161357311	0.7365810	11068	13254	11054.434	12837.953	4.6628514	5.4670439	0.2295	0.0535155125599	1.172467911	8659	7903	8744.844	7560.825	3.3019848	2.9917677	-0.1423	-0.108115757015	0.906051312	5505	5572	5655.8015	5311.4823	2.5175042	2.3952009	-0.0718	-0.101126972694	0.951418813	788	1031	854.96822	982.7372	0.3777618	0.4316183	0.1923	0.0578986943506	1.142567414	5828	4765	5977.1475	4527.6497	2.9117571	2.2021761	-0.4030	-0.151335216138	0.756304915	877	1073	949.51679	1021.6375	0.3861686	0.4171893	0.1115	0.110955168141	1.080329416	1532	1358	1627.6704	1287.667	0.6430548	0.5283588	-0.2834	-0.277538994368	0.821638817	269	239	270.51937	247.9616	0.1277532	0.1133848	-0.1721	-0.147902535473	0.887530118	3039	3127	3167.0004	2966.6417	1.3562832	1.2259873	-0.1457	-0.0267823666911	0.903931619	627	739	679.9436	711.3682	0.298783	0.3153273	0.0778	0.15920406416	1.055372320	2370	2013	2483.7313	1908.1587	0.9365646	0.716556	-0.3863	-0.191847018451	0.7650898!sample_table_end
