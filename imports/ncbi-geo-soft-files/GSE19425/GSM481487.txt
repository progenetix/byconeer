Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481487/suppl/GSM481487_DE396.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1259	992	1051.5446	1182.6916	0.9664867	1.0800949	-0.1603	-0.133527724193	0.89481652	1007	785	844.5741	934.754	0.9746727	1.0028499	-0.0411	-0.0101715419016	0.97190283	1861	1003	1520.0181	1195.4158	1.3641157	1.2403348	0.1372	-0.0827068416513	1.09979634	3497	1927	2740.2695	2323.1305	2.4227854	2.3388452	0.0509	-0.122241240734	1.03588965	8241	4627	6132.4681	5719.4151	5.5044783	5.9174871	-0.1044	-0.165579746922	0.93020536	4141	2445	3200.7343	2962.3091	2.9603582	3.2143626	-0.1188	-0.094542608345	0.92097827	1131	726	947.5687	864.6508	1.0474359	0.9881086	0.0841	0.0137809574765	1.06004128	863	640	725.4132	763.8817	0.6202393	0.6827177	-0.1385	-0.0533416544165	0.90848569	1060	812	888.4991	967.5437	1.0502904	1.0102243	0.0561	-0.171462602728	1.039660510	2633	2353	2110.4398	2849.3071	2.1324381	2.7067401	-0.3441	-0.267481354148	0.787825211	6590	5153	4966.1104	6392.7963	4.6789404	5.9472024	-0.3460	-0.252459190831	0.786746412	1568	1149	1295.7134	1367.1203	1.5959202	1.5886219	0.0066	-0.196429568608	1.004594113	1486	1591	1230.6512	1906.2271	1.5908747	2.2059438	-0.4716	-0.386742353147	0.721176414	3031	2337	2407.9177	2829.6611	2.7420167	2.9271635	-0.0943	-0.0640502189195	0.936748715	1869	1424	1526.3071	1701.4947	1.5807506	1.6861248	-0.0931	-0.172886158223	0.93750516	1001	805	839.6491	959.0187	0.96058	1.0707716	-0.1567	-0.224331775846	0.897091317	855	570	718.5428	684.4871	0.7519502	0.6835049	0.1377	0.0155767812836	1.100138618	1691	1256	1389.0612	1497.5731	1.2646022	1.5692231	-0.3114	-0.254884922359	0.805877819	985	856	826.5133	1020.3352	0.951837	1.0473245	-0.1379	-0.177239216267	0.908827120	771	509	645.959	617.4153	0.7004606	0.6280048	0.1575	-0.0950225394826	1.1153745!sample_table_end
