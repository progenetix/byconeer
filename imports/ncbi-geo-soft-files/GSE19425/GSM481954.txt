Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481954/suppl/GSM481954_MR380.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	7319	5110	6889.7988	5458.0141	1.4443133	1.1379394	-0.3440	0.187622330244	0.78787572	6682	7014	6268.9511	7386.5803	1.335005	1.6149818	0.2747	0.098259324283	1.20971973	4112	3164	3781.7882	3459.3406	0.8150994	0.750208	-0.1197	0.0225472109902	0.92038844	13955	13067	13356.822	13464.251	2.9807725	2.990396	0.0047	-0.0989777264032	1.00322855	20240	20408	19456.222	20813.765	4.6165122	4.9127861	0.0897	-0.101557878233	1.0641776	10873	9205	10376.542	9579.8713	2.3786927	2.1834557	-0.1236	0.0208900207933	0.91792257	3283	3504	2991.053	3812.9179	0.5944421	0.7542082	0.3434	0.0228982721454	1.26876658	4662	4114	4312.5211	4444.1651	0.9213085	0.9356151	0.0222	-0.0330114343314	1.01552869	7101	5351	6675.1478	5704.1249	1.2889967	1.1355955	-0.1828	-0.0716314053734	0.880991810	14791	14366	14174.817	14756.749	3.2234121	3.2759565	0.0233	0.0527608754377	1.016300811	20796	13827	19992.67	14219.89	4.4200145	3.132475	-0.4967	-0.290802017392	0.708702412	13708	13636	13117.454	14029.744	2.7088477	2.7749992	0.0348	-0.203504691734	1.024420513	7679	6825	7245.0719	7192.997	1.4679867	1.4107095	-0.0574	-0.00523119194644	0.960982414	15886	17229	15224.336	17612.267	3.3272918	3.8853882	0.2237	-0.154746644725	1.167732915	6400	5951	5991.1181	6317.8962	1.1582437	1.1957886	0.0460	0.0170882525351	1.032415316	5161	5652	4794.0463	6010.1975	0.9100318	1.1351401	0.3189	-0.040224266873	1.247363117	1700	1177	1517.2128	1355.9297	0.3437334	0.3106037	-0.1462	0.146909072408	0.90361818	8437	8276	7991.9482	8670.8353	1.6532978	1.7541552	0.0854	0.122934135994	1.061003719	4537	3679	4191.3628	3991.9842	0.9079863	0.8996647	-0.0133	0.0383357373656	0.99083520	3667	3326	3359.3124	3628.803	0.8099773	0.8735822	0.1091	-0.0618492047622	1.0785267!sample_table_end
