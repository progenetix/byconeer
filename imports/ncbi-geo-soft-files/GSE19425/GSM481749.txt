Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481749/suppl/GSM481749_JBH519.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	906	702	886.3169	726.014	1.0296755	0.8477417	0.2805	-0.00613232101004	1.21460992	714	636	692.4496	663.4897	0.8518823	0.80292	0.0854	0.119242749192	1.06098033	1062	836	1044.5577	855.418	0.9130103	0.7413128	0.3005	0.159666899469	1.23161274	7105	5092	6738.9894	5091.9815	5.8350003	4.5147486	0.3701	-0.0111404882664	1.29243085	9670	10873	9039.7382	10964.988	7.9752115	9.6395113	-0.2734	-0.236940307552	0.8273466	4319	4870	4162.1695	4869.8202	4.1594438	4.87736	-0.2297	-0.268008658404	0.85280647	1558	1597	1533.9858	1606.7342	1.1963653	1.2727958	-0.0893	-0.129595491189	0.93995078	1254	1312	1234.744	1323.8396	0.9057234	1.0099039	-0.1571	-0.0785219580858	0.89684129	1292	1236	1271.58	1249.8011	1.4676858	1.3911634	0.0773	-0.0247700089246	1.05500610	7135	6937	6766.3393	6952.8681	4.2862074	4.5584546	-0.0888	-0.140257517257	0.940276411	5556	4750	5316.611	4749.0196	3.4540379	3.2090911	0.1061	0.0246481847332	1.07632912	6506	4350	6190.5055	4348.3139	4.3348573	3.0661586	0.4996	0.164859504963	1.413774613	1592	1452	1567.3932	1461.1502	1.0415401	0.993217	0.0685	0.0887745880282	1.04865314	2459	2592	2404.4985	2591.9594	3.3134451	3.4943919	-0.0767	-0.120201276971	0.948217915	1292	1154	1271.58	1167.2163	0.8128682	0.7496564	0.1168	0.0109593947832	1.08432116	1342	1273	1320.1072	1286.0231	0.8854246	0.8907831	-0.0087	0.248085563417	0.993984417	324	241	281.5097	286.6852	0.3464489	0.3570284	-0.0434	-0.0175866527241	0.97036818	1563	1561	1538.9722	1570.7249	1.6554177	1.629552	0.0227	-0.0622337697486	1.015872919	550	459	524.5183	497.0275	0.6210876	0.5842969	0.0881	0.0248183654416	1.062965720	1912	1313	1874.8849	1324.8045	1.1575051	0.8448105	0.4543	0.0440233428098	1.3701357!sample_table_end
