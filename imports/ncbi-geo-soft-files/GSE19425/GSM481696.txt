Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481696/suppl/GSM481696_JBH096.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1669	1451	1692.9526	1443.5971	0.9617583	0.775683	-0.3102	-0.0783201073784	0.80652582	1700	1254	1725.6616	1266.3665	1.0551735	0.7249431	-0.5415	-0.484612773832	0.68703673	1620	1452	1640.9293	1444.495	1.0276852	0.8502278	-0.2735	-0.15175769586	0.82732314	5419	3139	5599.9727	2966.8709	3.4789272	1.7819082	-0.9652	-0.804048209089	0.51220045	10823	6954	10952.582	6481.5706	5.8890694	3.7521634	-0.6503	-0.653163102466	0.63714026	4418	2994	4576.2825	2834.4443	2.9603592	1.6986548	-0.8014	-0.808036027655	0.57380027	1167	704	1140.9256	778.587	0.955321	0.6415051	-0.5745	-0.656343788321	0.67150738	1375	863	1373.2861	920.3458	0.8112583	0.5521606	-0.5551	-0.275508402891	0.68062239	1979	1844	2023.7174	1800.0174	1.1620061	0.986099	-0.2368	-0.367297124085	0.848617710	4920	4363	5088.7047	4080.9147	2.8475326	2.469532	-0.2055	-0.275389923489	0.867253211	8398	7949	8567.8803	7408.3018	4.9550949	4.6143227	-0.1028	-0.076274343623	0.931227912	2323	1371	2390.6948	1371.321	1.740626	1.0410728	-0.7415	-0.620336988599	0.598102513	1878	1941	1915.8956	1885.233	1.3064282	1.4033627	0.1033	0.0350291152783	1.074198114	5356	4907	5536.3676	4576.4615	3.8658551	2.6637642	-0.5373	-0.44706234938	0.689049115	2184	2193	2241.8953	2112.8574	1.4013468	1.4025536	0.0012	-0.0368582372591	1.000861116	1101	1133	1068.2762	1160.3789	0.8375178	0.8990033	0.1022	0.0396523370532	1.073413917	920	973	871.1008	1016.4179	0.5390291	0.5860067	0.1206	0.213824544296	1.087152218	2074	1758	2124.4277	1721.8732	1.321001	0.9096482	-0.5383	-0.495369987967	0.688605219	1584	1433	1601.5603	1427.4327	0.9635808	0.8458087	-0.1881	-0.103302331239	0.877776520	1020	695	978.799	770.4065	0.5027551	0.4259372	-0.2392	-0.179393969103	0.847206!sample_table_end
