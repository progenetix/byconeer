Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481792/suppl/GSM481792_MR030.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3206	3010	3204.8058	2992.6622	1.0700042	1.0210247	-0.0676	-0.0407673395323	0.95422492	2957	2502	2958.3256	2498.2295	1.0472766	0.8559277	-0.2911	-0.10644889593	0.81728913	2807	2640	2812.5031	2631.1529	0.9634252	0.974637	0.0167	0.0576357570491	1.01163744	13493	11103	12998.466	11231.001	4.833966	4.390803	-0.1387	-0.0152871317951	0.90832315	24838	18473	23369.297	18917.346	8.3763622	7.3223714	-0.1940	-0.246708132866	0.87417086	8906	9922	8692.9255	10013.275	3.1705942	3.9257363	0.3082	0.415461445056	1.23817057	2942	3914	2943.8415	3897.4652	1.1040066	1.4088748	0.3518	0.256243069322	1.27614718	2776	3082	2781.8793	3063.9613	0.9657923	1.0798132	0.1610	0.0167285016595	1.11805959	4282	4216	4278.2916	4199.6612	1.4003437	1.3151561	-0.0905	-0.0969407453846	0.939166710	9088	9890	8864.9614	9980.5938	3.4155347	3.6475496	0.0948	0.137736172354	1.067929311	10190	10114	9901.8665	10209.435	3.6971219	3.7643582	0.0260	0.0307300198292	1.018186112	5996	6926	5942.1256	6944.5315	2.1530076	2.4724753	0.1996	-0.0368315377985	1.14838213	3521	4112	3522.9507	4096.1368	1.3474471	1.4649629	0.1206	0.00848660211885	1.087213714	10117	9984	9832.3644	10076.615	3.8888824	3.7797519	-0.0411	-0.137988945329	0.971937815	3165	3566	3163.6377	3545.8509	1.0590056	1.1455612	0.1133	0.0534939649202	1.081732916	2957	2954	2958.3256	2937.0944	1.0156535	1.0106621	-0.0071	0.00380556679924	0.995085517	1435	1377	1425.713	1403.2206	0.4951061	0.474706	-0.0607	-0.0524228573356	0.958796418	5708	5630	5662.4452	5609.1125	1.9050976	1.9586321	0.0400	-0.0432585720656	1.028100719	2038	2064	2034.3116	2065.3436	0.7214559	0.7133543	-0.0163	-0.0934363907653	0.988770420	1605	1613	1597.6367	1630.3954	0.6466038	0.636296	-0.0232	-0.00117835503276	0.9840586!sample_table_end
