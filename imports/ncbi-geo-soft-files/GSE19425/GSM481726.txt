Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481726/suppl/GSM481726_JBH368.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3481	3353	3573.8659	3268.738	0.8757681	0.6977329	-0.3279	-0.155144388605	0.79670962	4766	5801	4839.0662	5666.5076	1.4880927	1.4109344	-0.0768	-0.201506808612	0.94814953	5065	4844	5133.147	4733.208	1.0832665	0.9721282	-0.1562	-0.182545733926	0.89740444	18170	15409	17372.285	15196.398	3.9291258	3.1271125	-0.3294	-0.332956115485	0.79587995	29232	26144	27036.463	25813.115	6.2183001	5.2365647	-0.2479	-0.17321686899	0.84212156	15278	11831	14800.581	11646.106	3.4950675	2.6171073	-0.4173	-0.244899892314	0.74880027	4854	3804	4924.9973	3703.7217	1.1727954	0.8959756	-0.3884	-0.294897842265	0.76396588	4369	3325	4446.0304	3242.5521	0.9386404	0.6584642	-0.5115	-0.367616243216	0.70150849	2892	3051	2969.8164	2982.1124	0.7773549	0.7343645	-0.0821	-0.186659379959	0.944696510	13961	10663	13613.742	10463.782	2.9201328	2.5377689	-0.2025	-0.104111608286	0.869059411	20118	14506	19104.394	14300.658	4.0957457	3.1784912	-0.3658	-0.22865547231	0.77604712	12767	15626	12520.94	15412.407	3.3716795	3.5596828	0.0783	-0.25167029869	1.055759513	4293	3746	4369.9062	3646.4852	1.3953933	1.1442843	-0.2862	-0.106575826524	0.820044214	15429	10535	14937.861	10334.935	3.4932133	2.7330144	-0.3541	-0.319757732814	0.782378315	4013	4009	4095.6407	3906.9809	0.8847837	0.791844	-0.1601	-0.0190790660343	0.894957616	3147	3616	3235.6481	3518.5018	0.9056616	0.8130403	-0.1556	-0.23679375753	0.897730817	1147	1234	1204.165	1256.106	0.3551161	0.29755	-0.2552	-0.0293541087047	0.83789518	7189	5043	7249.1496	4931.0459	1.3736919	1.1203336	-0.2941	-0.426674863435	0.815563919	2455	2493	2541.6846	2442.1123	0.74329	0.6325393	-0.2328	-0.0933122269459	0.850999320	2461	2344	2547.8209	2302.5987	0.5535579	0.596023	0.1066	-0.0248562816706	1.076713!sample_table_end
