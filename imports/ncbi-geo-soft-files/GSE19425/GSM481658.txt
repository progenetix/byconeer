Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481658/suppl/GSM481658_JA812.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4329	3349	4363.2351	3267.1517	1.414724	0.9985759	-0.5026	-0.333107751176	0.7058452	2645	3096	2681.2495	3024.2592	1.2117319	1.1833387	-0.0342	0.159945071744	0.9765683	4114	3285	4145.3616	3206.6921	1.2063786	0.9378183	-0.3633	-0.250586747877	0.7773834	12380	11244	12186.963	10699.039	3.3250438	2.9663569	-0.1647	0.143445796259	0.89212565	16052	14257	15663.241	13588.19	5.2604992	4.7254852	-0.1547	-0.00527649856678	0.89829596	9799	12714	9703.6725	12110.426	3.0305762	3.7574862	0.3102	0.49503065366	1.23985877	1337	1281	1378.9568	1317.0006	0.8018756	0.9003743	0.1671	0.275322855838	1.12283528	3227	3588	3266.8121	3487.5866	0.844132	0.8906843	0.0774	0.315831443887	1.05514829	2983	3335	3017.3999	3253.9302	1.3511361	1.2379094	-0.1263	-0.0382241948686	0.916198810	10466	12738	10349.098	12133.351	2.5071733	2.9155368	0.2177	0.0536941370517	1.16287811	22511	15269	21636.164	14568.09	5.5304201	3.7524235	-0.5596	-0.298859577481	0.67850612	6382	5178	6381.5579	4986.755	2.1298924	1.9238666	-0.1468	-0.037340747912	0.903269313	6363	5316	6363.1866	5116.481	1.6610328	1.5712245	-0.0802	-0.24638954235	0.945932214	8035	8398	7971.837	7986.6605	3.7571873	3.237426	-0.2148	-0.0302065860363	0.861662115	5617	5658	5619.2907	5434.2368	1.5689047	1.6011732	0.0294	-0.0334216086611	1.020567516	2601	2318	2638.7405	2290.2524	1.0104197	1.0321164	0.0307	-0.214696872321	1.021472917	1386	1441	1428.168	1469.7101	0.6088196	0.5461246	-0.1568	-0.162095919235	0.89702218	4513	5326	4549.3732	5125.7848	1.5665675	1.6874541	0.1072	0.054513996862	1.077166519	2135	2764	2178.6589	2711.3279	0.9857976	1.0167123	0.0445	-0.194046541116	1.0313620	2532	2059	2570.8298	2055.3844	0.6220649	0.4638066	-0.4235	-0.287634857907	0.7455919!sample_table_end
