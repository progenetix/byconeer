Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481518/suppl/GSM481518_DE481.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4932	2760	4189.097	3281.1529	0.9676954	0.7499858	-0.3677	-0.185270205428	0.77502252	7946	5597	6866.9251	6426.8695	2.015085	1.7503294	-0.2032	-0.125818022708	0.86861313	5785	4300	4930.3828	5020.9465	1.1127522	1.1247005	0.0154	0.015200236248	1.01073764	26453	18245	22428.278	19464.573	4.9323488	4.4206693	-0.1580	-0.127691074598	0.89626045	23174	15490	19836.669	16562.133	5.5992935	4.3293889	-0.3711	-0.300347719911	0.77320276	10580	8272	9265.563	9219.3762	2.3107139	2.2550192	-0.0352	0.0249493909086	0.97589727	3324	3101	2804.5375	3672.7059	0.9670747	1.1132231	0.2030	0.241992680266	1.15112428	4417	2883	3738.6095	3421.1614	0.7435587	0.7440415	0.0009	-0.0474454908066	1.00064929	4366	2793	3694.4544	3318.2316	1.0558993	0.874797	-0.2715	-0.232983942249	0.828485310	15861	10949	13826.479	11922.262	2.9399522	2.6423486	-0.1540	-0.0864206875402	0.898772611	29807	12781	25002.424	13769.147	5.3035288	3.1362194	-0.7579	-0.577849859764	0.591345712	13948	14599	12190.961	15630.219	3.2264397	4.1578747	0.3659	0.282773083923	1.288688113	8268	5217	7159.879	6016.4656	1.5202777	1.285246	-0.2423	-0.238879552259	0.845402114	11798	8787	10329.259	9741.4194	3.9379899	3.1505899	-0.3218	-0.355855281604	0.800050215	6621	4362	5674.062	5089.0201	1.2651792	1.1510369	-0.1364	-0.136105925021	0.909781716	3941	2814	3332.6805	3341.8147	0.9421814	0.9059687	-0.0565	-0.13132859401	0.96156517	1722	1232	1476.6033	1497.3382	0.4172466	0.3888747	-0.1016	0.0673111824174	0.932001918	6091	4472	5202.7368	5209.6581	1.4991069	1.4452978	-0.0527	-0.111581579836	0.964105819	4214	2814	3563.0439	3341.8147	0.9462449	0.8328583	-0.1841	-0.0906402704061	0.88017220	3433	1922	2899.1151	2317.7387	0.5308016	0.4668516	-0.1852	-0.109998212398	0.8795217!sample_table_end
