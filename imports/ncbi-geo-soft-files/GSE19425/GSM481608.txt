Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481608/suppl/GSM481608_EL674.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2209	2295	2195.9526	2305.5244	0.9733385	1.0515077	0.1114	0.163096138436	1.08031032	1042	1102	1056.1743	1131.9189	0.7246835	0.6375338	-0.1848	-0.035484581693	0.87974093	2874	2374	2853.9439	2379.3914	0.8811641	0.8519649	-0.0486	0.0709345635738	0.96686294	13826	8700	13516.485	8457.5775	4.6687849	3.4989372	-0.4161	-0.288453289414	0.7494325	14741	17978	14385.287	17494.15	4.4988279	6.0019522	0.4159	-0.306677287696	1.33411466	13912	9585	13598.133	9311.111	4.6687708	3.7026702	-0.3345	-0.339100253745	0.79307177	2010	3026	2008.1056	3001.5228	0.7628562	0.9997474	0.3902	0.0547713923132	1.31053188	2976	2200	2951.6805	2215.0275	0.8981545	0.7601539	-0.2407	-0.302420557115	0.84635089	2042	2095	2038.5726	2113.9518	1.3375192	1.1177397	-0.2590	-0.167428924523	0.835681210	13730	13225	13425.311	12837.5	4.4426333	4.3085498	-0.0442	-0.185326767095	0.969818911	10253	10615	10074.991	10301.586	3.111592	3.4188834	0.1359	0.167705648563	1.098756912	6924	6625	6841.6866	6474.2005	2.5581011	2.3019074	-0.1522	0.021030076615	0.8998513	1423	2302	1427.9126	2312.0771	0.5990959	0.7726317	0.3670	0.263233604221	1.289662814	3839	5258	3817.7317	5164.7109	2.831175	2.9214734	0.0453	0.0181337726894	1.031894315	1797	1992	1796.3672	2014.5199	0.6514296	0.7136803	0.1317	-0.00393407731626	1.0955616	1566	2449	1567.0442	2450.5192	0.5679518	0.820891	0.5314	0.0575755949151	1.445353117	346	402	341.429	427.7255	0.2239615	0.2412148	0.1071	0.190583888549	1.077036918	4889	3679	4853.6944	3642.6445	1.8090964	1.4084252	-0.3612	-0.281672781932	0.778524119	921	1219	936.3886	1247.9812	0.58803	0.6938409	0.2387	0.0634753306536	1.179941220	3362	2340	3335.1223	2347.6216	1.0110089	0.761424	-0.4090	-0.205638203234	0.7531327!sample_table_end
