Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481483/suppl/GSM481483_DE392.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1616	1505	1629.3384	1469.6982	1.3739404	1.3249841	0.0523	-0.0234827098463	1.03694852	1206	3605	1227.2816	3546.0166	1.6645726	5.3557367	-1.6859	-0.78293871887	0.31080183	3000	2001	2956.5868	1958.9968	1.5663797	1.1749613	0.4148	0.149690548494	1.3331334	3645	3645	3566.7972	3585.979	2.5927368	2.4570718	0.0775	-0.0105640387884	1.05521415	7834	7807	7455.0217	7803.5695	4.3364054	4.8464775	-0.1604	-0.0978290116646	0.89475416	6711	6422	6428.7637	6389.5354	3.8762469	4.3487489	-0.1659	-0.156436101602	0.89134767	1362	1549	1379.9067	1512.8357	1.0703661	1.0794179	-0.0121	0.0977515536497	0.99161428	999	1097	1023.8858	1071.0484	0.7732238	0.7878546	-0.0270	-0.0934559236442	0.98142959	687	730	706.9563	723.79	0.9863562	1.1129917	-0.1743	-0.115805410161	0.886220610	4758	5071	4619.1032	5018.6917	4.9359199	5.0824404	-0.0422	-0.0959313964378	0.971171211	5301	6468	5127.1195	6436.2048	5.5760205	6.2531853	-0.1654	-0.204812590168	0.891708812	2079	2351	2070.472	2307.2709	1.546909	1.5915457	-0.0410	0.155733303372	0.971953913	2195	2393	2182.708	2348.9697	2.1810935	2.149137	0.0213	-0.0345875159775	1.014869514	756	1720	779.9079	1681.3654	1.5885863	2.2934596	-0.5298	-0.17398688011	0.692659415	1942	1773	1941.5277	1733.5618	1.2602794	1.0884858	0.2114	0.0833212216307	1.15782816	1765	1864	1775.1113	1823.1826	1.28991	1.2421727	0.0544	-0.00275504579582	1.038430517	620	432	635.0292	440.5753	0.7676469	0.6021792	0.3502	0.195030674604	1.274781518	3053	2601	3007.1213	2555.3462	2.0840663	1.9338471	0.1079	-0.0533388399933	1.077678919	1035	906	1059.2065	891.1114	1.3878987	1.2102554	0.1976	0.0443145153705	1.146781620	918	735	943.6977	728.3913	0.9683897	0.7089646	0.4499	0.0602805486299	1.3659211!sample_table_end
