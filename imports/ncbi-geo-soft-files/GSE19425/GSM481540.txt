Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481540/suppl/GSM481540_EL160.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1371	1126	1355.3602	1134.6003	1.0437845	0.8563602	-0.2855	-0.06449969889	0.82043762	1446	1432	1429.9369	1440.1526	1.3639798	1.3053515	-0.0634	-0.0183448231735	0.95701663	1122	968	1111.9083	977.1076	0.6806244	0.5869966	-0.2135	-0.0347236925047	0.86243824	7501	6301	7175.5326	6412.0113	4.9418785	4.2819105	-0.2068	-0.241707740141	0.8664545	13518	17493	12571.348	18600.08	7.7908381	11.362921	0.5445	0.0935192068274	1.45849796	7297	6834	6986.5408	6972.0973	4.723367	4.6012431	-0.0378	0.0328027604575	0.97414477	1578	2069	1560.9595	2074.3735	0.9025039	1.2188773	0.4335	-0.0358710854833	1.35055058	1836	1688	1812.9797	1693.3498	1.2226149	1.1279487	-0.1163	-0.00638657143972	0.92257079	2303	2159	2268.4021	2163.3224	2.0893679	1.898567	-0.1382	-0.0716636084303	0.9086810	2578	2768	2536.3745	2778.9121	2.3537023	2.5637522	0.1233	-0.0445701190514	1.089242311	5649	4181	5456.1874	4216.7014	4.5464393	3.5094612	-0.3735	-0.195606712307	0.771914212	2194	1866	2160.9604	1873.95	1.331989	1.2073309	-0.1418	-0.0223257094898	0.906412113	1724	1469	1702.6529	1477.4344	1.3403829	1.220505	-0.1352	0.00315835079359	0.910564314	2532	2415	2491.8323	2421.6199	2.7977777	2.6297993	-0.0893	0.0708886887426	0.9399615	1242	989	1228.4368	998.1203	0.77352	0.6424717	-0.2678	-0.23666211322	0.830581816	1401	1399	1385.1879	1406.6439	0.7435151	0.7795146	0.0682	-0.01016096481	1.048417917	575	487	569.6346	505.2141	0.5320757	0.4533276	-0.2311	-0.125794064156	0.851998318	1813	1732	1790.4503	1738.12	1.346071	1.2790615	-0.0737	0.0302617697164	0.950218419	690	639	683.1568	653.8882	0.6447403	0.6010927	-0.1011	-0.00628599320838	0.932301920	1283	1023	1268.4648	1032.1209	1.0973522	0.8819629	-0.3152	-0.0506267624723	0.803719!sample_table_end
