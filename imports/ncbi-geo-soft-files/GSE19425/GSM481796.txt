Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481796/suppl/GSM481796_MR038.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3215	3347	3358.124	3194.8759	1.2460413	1.1603799	-0.1028	-0.182611096124	0.93125312	2292	2512	2387.077	2412.2617	0.9123789	0.8270746	-0.1416	-0.0157207521212	0.90650353	3846	3622	4015.7421	3452.1199	1.3888521	1.2156643	-0.1921	-0.172063305033	0.87530154	10090	9429	10291.648	8872.8867	3.7776857	3.4046435	-0.1500	-0.223408551821	0.90125115	18750	15628	18563.274	14940.639	7.1178901	5.7821806	-0.2998	-0.323786219818	0.81234476	7600	9625	7827.5698	9060.2794	2.9430273	3.4146891	0.2145	0.266756082645	1.16026417	2259	2916	2352.8809	2784.6969	0.9605663	1.1026662	0.1990	0.344607531899	1.14793358	2213	2462	2305.21	2366.2768	0.8403345	0.9493053	0.1759	-0.0437688961475	1.12967559	4335	5340	4513.6297	5030.1726	1.6067567	1.5627665	-0.0400	-0.0558878566028	0.972621810	11491	10791	11651.86	10194.336	4.5306235	4.1819859	-0.1155	-0.0776243342206	0.923048611	13065	11031	13166.722	10427.591	5.1566365	4.5004325	-0.1964	-0.0419228483163	0.872745712	5679	6381	5904.3632	6012.1695	2.4023767	2.5604094	0.0919	-0.155195700764	1.065781813	3531	4072	3692.7284	3858.6618	1.642685	1.5801183	-0.0560	-0.0757784845181	0.961911914	5361	6339	5575.9598	5972.8283	3.1747582	2.6524116	-0.2593	-0.240945929868	0.835468915	3636	3121	3801.8796	2982.175	1.4766605	1.2623842	-0.2262	-0.108228496384	0.854891316	2922	3053	3050.7153	2917.0156	1.2767922	1.1704857	-0.1254	-0.143093295204	0.916739417	1440	1704	1493.3459	1654.9037	0.5627071	0.5602215	-0.0064	0.161313069064	0.995582818	4947	6476	5147.1963	6101.2532	1.9306678	2.1659528	0.1659	0.0242532881615	1.121867119	2178	2766	2269.0631	2643.8401	0.8782083	0.9071339	0.0468	0.00338837097078	1.03293720	1606	1361	1667.6462	1335.3504	0.6149136	0.5044569	-0.2857	-0.174560921422	0.8203703!sample_table_end
