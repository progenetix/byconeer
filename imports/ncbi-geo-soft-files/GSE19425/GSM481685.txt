Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481685/suppl/GSM481685_JA951.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1157	976	1096.4282	1023.4347	0.8800467	0.8281335	0.0877	-0.0709536553602	1.0626872	1776	1444	1675.7714	1513.7059	1.287872	1.1824932	0.1232	0.192125596178	1.08911573	954	752	902.9562	793.6756	0.90482	0.7996422	0.1783	-0.106325828029	1.13153114	3375	2742	3132.2239	2908.2547	3.4772603	3.2358694	0.1038	0.145441649021	1.07459845	4245	3991	3908.5275	4283.6562	5.125668	5.7001808	-0.1533	0.00388024349047	0.89921146	3150	2759	2929.811	2926.7252	2.9349769	3.0179603	-0.0402	-0.0726757176859	0.97250357	571	470	539.1487	498.7433	1.1024995	1.075952	0.0352	0.127267970826	1.02467348	992	808	939.1534	851.6346	1.1496006	1.0038405	0.1956	0.158454661483	1.14520239	1270	1168	1203.7292	1225.0312	0.8433588	0.8746546	-0.0526	0.0320915308756	0.964219110	1270	1403	1203.7292	1471.2899	1.6773651	1.9369574	-0.2076	-0.131438184116	0.865979311	2420	2369	2266.4128	2501.2654	3.0073707	3.0120852	-0.0023	-0.182570670106	0.998434812	731	644	689.703	680.3208	1.5168641	1.5353856	-0.0175	0.0412410193802	0.987936913	520	426	491.3143	453.8074	0.8728738	0.8033978	0.1197	0.0515928919987	1.086477714	3928	3786	3626.9832	4055.0074	3.1457114	3.5063373	-0.1566	0.0936411649227	0.897150215	714	652	673.5661	688.8501	1.1221448	1.1535642	-0.0398	-0.0350009028027	0.972763116	398	362	376.1272	387.5939	0.7826862	0.8453142	-0.1111	-0.105231119423	0.925911517	734	545	692.5705	576.7366	0.5384616	0.4672965	0.2045	-0.00882489408431	1.152291118	1062	905	1005.1834	951.2697	1.1921793	1.118987	0.0914	-0.0775618239573	1.065409319	905	823	855.9611	867.1406	0.6861902	0.7025126	-0.0339	-0.124557763674	0.976765620	739	631	697.3504	666.4732	0.5234625	0.5020415	0.0603	-0.0157612844544	1.0426678!sample_table_end
