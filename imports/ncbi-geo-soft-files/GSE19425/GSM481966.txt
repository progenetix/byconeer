Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481966/suppl/GSM481966_MR418.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5822	5175	5781.0419	5191.8721	1.1922825	1.0372178	-0.2010	0.21061778216	0.8699432	9151	8763	9107.632	8617.1288	1.7487937	1.7152563	-0.0279	-0.132338639355	0.98082253	3197	2954	3127.0873	3030.3596	0.8495487	0.7904632	-0.1040	0.214707611038	0.93045074	10391	10774	10346.374	10568.182	3.2339518	3.1833609	-0.0227	0.0395536618173	0.98435635	18126	19308	17969.352	18788.003	4.1941322	4.1683982	-0.0089	-0.000442123926535	0.99386426	9323	8884	9280.3049	8735.5586	2.8145436	2.5299659	-0.1538	-0.152830042751	0.89889037	2895	2885	2825.2429	2961.497	0.8537499	0.8594761	0.0096	-0.0386141451556	1.0067078	3268	3344	3198.6379	3415.9288	1.0356169	1.0910379	0.0752	-0.251031456921	1.05351499	7065	6049	7023.3499	6034.5148	1.3260566	1.2093239	-0.1329	-0.10203022376	0.9119710	14329	12711	14240.749	12420.611	4.8663774	4.2601617	-0.1919	-0.0402312244359	0.875427711	9502	9795	9461.4745	9626.386	2.7517587	2.8105511	0.0305	0.073105356733	1.021365312	5552	6827	5507.399	6770.3284	1.8679716	2.2362605	0.2596	0.291021765899	1.197159713	3642	3844	3577.7944	3897.4949	1.2582167	1.3952256	0.1491	0.265253006726	1.108891314	10064	11098	10023.231	10876.41	2.3606949	2.6683732	0.1767	0.0634682895976	1.130333715	2243	2258	2176.0778	2344.0622	0.690235	0.7151626	0.0512	0.0182228121141	1.036114616	2400	2754	2334.6141	2833.6699	0.7315727	0.871492	0.2525	0.168386589179	1.191258117	1910	1632	1851.867	1721.998	0.3618028	0.3412481	-0.0844	0.141978897393	0.943187918	5705	4697	5662.8611	4724.2788	1.6271327	1.3492803	-0.2701	-0.280760947271	0.82923819	3981	3643	3918.3206	3702.0902	0.7897403	0.7564091	-0.0622	0.084389923241	0.957794620	3648	3522	3583.8115	3585.555	1.096476	1.1441789	0.0614	-0.0248526709691	1.0435055!sample_table_end
