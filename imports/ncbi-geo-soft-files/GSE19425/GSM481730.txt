Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481730/suppl/GSM481730_JBH402.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4272	3651	4280.2015	3639.5124	1.0037388	0.8712044	-0.2043	-0.374963278896	0.86795922	4309	4684	4318.6946	4611.3523	1.5659341	1.5266135	-0.0367	-0.0558872117408	0.974893	4223	3973	4228.9723	3942.8733	0.8687787	0.8546626	-0.0236	-0.124005097506	0.98375184	25498	21827	24626.419	21762.771	5.1254642	4.704304	-0.1237	-0.0650514151003	0.91782985	27518	25593	26439.574	25671.659	5.9619993	5.8580751	-0.0254	-0.147064985774	0.98256896	11878	14584	11910.239	14331.951	2.8054594	3.4400174	0.2942	0.212812102056	1.22618687	4460	6081	4475.7418	5948.3681	0.9737903	1.16095	0.2536	0.267084731804	1.19219718	4351	4541	4362.3572	4475.7247	0.8262483	0.9502358	0.2017	0.21135976945	1.15006079	3402	2996	3386.5155	3027.7049	1.1983789	0.9669058	-0.3096	-0.457866624285	0.806844810	19272	18094	18925.268	17919.297	3.7476978	3.6991881	-0.0188	0.0125844054078	0.987056111	24555	21661	23783.513	21592.423	4.6283489	4.4071952	-0.0706	-0.0500104683689	0.952217512	13766	15539	13721.511	15301.686	2.8573466	3.365263	0.2360	-0.0765984641186	1.17775813	4968	6619	5001.4767	6462.8498	1.2235076	1.2691365	0.0528	-0.0901722223038	1.037293414	12379	13589	12390.23	13328.37	4.3596544	4.075004	-0.0974	-0.106116462773	0.93470815	4541	4239	4559.9805	4191.5667	0.8690676	0.8335706	-0.0602	-0.0576937457122	0.95915516	4745	5107	4771.7688	5009.3339	0.9694251	0.9763758	0.0103	0.0356447406892	1.007169917	1024	920	1012.1347	984.3275	0.353935	0.3102947	-0.1898	-0.18139759745	0.876699618	8282	8506	8364.1234	8298.7008	1.7952423	1.81267	0.0139	-0.0975211874168	1.009707619	2257	1958	2237.1678	2023.9915	0.7399444	0.6390694	-0.2114	-0.257423793523	0.863672220	3545	3098	3529.3837	3124.0648	0.6989613	0.6545557	-0.0947	-0.113381260449	0.936469!sample_table_end
