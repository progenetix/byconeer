Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481669/suppl/GSM481669_JA921.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3816	2409	3510.5917	2514.2277	1.5684448	1.34071	0.2263	-0.0176954412263	1.16986132	2361	1447	2166.7126	1536.4044	0.9537159	0.8188764	0.2199	0.0656251106466	1.1646643	2104	1827	1938.5471	1927.4964	1.0566884	1.125948	-0.0916	-0.116303180319	0.93848774	3499	3208	3214.5152	3310.4276	1.7189381	1.9353145	-0.1711	-0.464668906406	0.88819575	3854	4377	3546.3108	4459.9595	2.5930272	3.2236131	-0.3140	-0.553857072445	0.80438536	5345	4318	4935.0965	4402.941	2.6846702	2.6342157	0.0274	-0.0208624881337	1.01915357	832	586	781.7729	652.6126	1.1496346	0.8426251	0.4482	0.272186386574	1.36434898	1320	1172	1230.9006	1256.206	0.7684007	0.8071979	-0.0711	-0.0046339986394	0.95193599	3642	3092	3347.4828	3194.7418	1.3830339	1.6018853	-0.2119	-0.0915199763524	0.863378810	1618	2738	1499.6347	2842.3945	1.4890041	2.5050366	-0.7505	-0.325012951189	0.594404111	7659	7633	7096.8945	7636.5812	6.2133674	6.3041593	-0.0209	-0.128303450815	0.985598112	969	1136	910.8869	1218.4092	1.1937636	1.3958795	-0.2257	-0.271705612504	0.855205313	779	1208	732.1982	1293.9803	1.3421863	1.9116064	-0.5102	-0.194760894143	0.702124814	6274	5553	5803.624	5601.1104	2.6256679	2.7221434	-0.0521	-0.152708808017	0.96455915	1434	1597	1333.2031	1692.035	1.4360245	1.5891017	-0.1461	-0.0364907930677	0.903670616	762	957	716.4718	1033.2062	0.9225501	1.1689922	-0.3416	-0.106901343013	0.789184117	2028	1613	1870.1259	1708.5607	0.8075452	0.8964258	-0.1506	-0.113765106717	0.900850118	2293	2550	2106.1943	2656.1084	1.269047	1.5584719	-0.2964	-0.068196767478	0.814289319	3194	2834	2934.7579	2937.8998	1.3245998	1.541848	-0.2191	-0.0682524598837	0.859098820	653	558	612.9951	623.2056	0.5147927	0.4836453	0.0900	-0.00975196108515	1.0644012!sample_table_end
