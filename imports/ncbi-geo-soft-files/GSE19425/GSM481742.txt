Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481742/suppl/GSM481742_JBH498.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3796	3251	3801.5968	3152.446	2.0196946	1.5897688	-0.3453	-0.0458004579799	0.78713332	1018	1391	1035.9985	1359.7238	0.7428637	0.8590838	0.2097	0.164218225806	1.15644873	1337	1322	1369.6422	1295.5966	1.100792	0.9181324	-0.2618	-0.0929022405638	0.83406534	3336	3839	3357.2466	3736.5279	2.7826311	2.7862657	0.0019	0.0179444209887	1.00130625	5281	7303	5198.8681	7248.0229	4.3788108	5.3327936	0.2844	0.14118124565	1.21786356	4494	5882	4458.9601	5797.2183	3.5278718	4.0883947	0.2127	0.0194206771284	1.15888417	1144	1322	1169.2512	1295.5966	0.8744334	0.9686107	0.1476	0.0255063999078	1.10770098	1585	1710	1623.9678	1663.6774	0.8712816	0.9321423	0.0974	-0.0238943932754	1.0698529	3187	3143	3213.1421	3043.8424	1.9665009	1.7017633	-0.2086	-0.100368936562	0.865376410	8401	9971	8043.0161	10046.677	4.012907	5.8108909	0.5341	0.181926258263	1.448050211	14373	9429	13244.855	9472.5705	6.8391656	5.4202928	-0.3354	-0.238228496939	0.792537112	2668	2552	2707.7968	2472.653	1.8498845	1.7082806	-0.1149	-0.0224739361686	0.923452613	3809	3329	3814.0525	3230.9673	2.514925	2.3081896	-0.1238	-0.161867585775	0.917796614	3509	4531	3522.8163	4428.2493	3.3845001	3.7394041	0.1439	0.144533017585	1.104861615	2486	1903	2531.2782	1845.8008	1.2259476	0.9818116	-0.3204	-0.263006902558	0.800859416	1510	1515	1547.5843	1480.3172	1.1759989	1.1083037	-0.0855	-0.125735318586	0.94243617	660	529	645.4076	565.3135	0.4153533	0.3340181	-0.3144	-0.195924643777	0.804178418	4481	4293	4446.607	4191.9704	1.7935666	1.7427376	-0.0415	-0.350381285393	0.971660419	1122	1526	1145.6718	1490.7775	0.8947875	1.030637	0.2039	0.159897809485	1.151823320	1723	1548	1763.9936	1511.6913	0.8247341	0.7965087	-0.0502	0.0207290464464	0.9657765!sample_table_end
