Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481591/suppl/GSM481591_EL653.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1553	1421	1537.8388	1445.4362	0.6866036	0.6582546	0.0608	-0.14748169438	1.04306692	1572	1423	1556.3945	1447.3964	0.8135455	0.7653315	0.0881	-0.248495419479	1.06299753	1153	1180	1137.3851	1204.2453	0.5422423	0.5576545	-0.0404	0.112982839919	0.97236264	12841	13439	12495.782	13338.161	5.0651529	5.6989413	-0.1701	-0.107032462056	0.88878835	11500	18987	11207.889	18918.014	5.7710063	9.3574895	-0.6973	-0.0420042265244	0.61672596	7830	8850	7666.6308	8764.5815	4.1382804	4.6803193	-0.1776	-0.0852748679496	0.88418767	1370	1613	1353.9339	1635.7943	0.9180971	1.0284632	-0.1638	-0.0688898236165	0.89268838	1213	1374	1197.9705	1399.3184	0.7285849	0.8921655	-0.2922	-0.130315639221	0.81664779	4442	4126	4374.5721	4126.2834	2.3103166	2.1754704	0.0868	-0.177161357311	1.061984810	14973	15362	14506.936	15262.278	6.9443961	7.5598978	-0.1225	0.0535155125599	0.918583311	3933	3903	3876.4435	3906.6717	2.1444076	2.2571078	-0.0739	-0.108115757015	0.950068712	5894	6594	5805.7885	6548.936	3.0297331	3.3163519	-0.1304	-0.101126972694	0.91357413	864	899	849.7071	929.2845	0.4775596	0.5035597	-0.0765	0.0578986943506	0.948367414	3555	3532	3500.9695	3540.6302	2.5176278	2.3485583	0.1003	-0.151335216138	1.071988615	919	813	903.7523	842.9816	0.5738222	0.531535	0.1104	0.110955168141	1.079556816	1105	1347	1088.5698	1372.2538	0.5585032	0.6742201	-0.2717	-0.277538994368	0.828369117	313	269	281.5392	304.2678	0.1460643	0.1591378	-0.1237	-0.147902535473	0.917847818	3760	3720	3704.6261	3726.2829	1.9849365	1.8621163	0.0921	-0.0267823666911	1.065957319	961	748	944.7237	778.2403	0.476523	0.4033102	0.2407	0.15920406416	1.181529920	2938	2702	2892.8278	2718.4091	1.0877999	1.0858376	0.0026	-0.191847018451	1.0018072!sample_table_end
