Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481791/suppl/GSM481791_MR029.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1855	1888	1839.6176	1899.1015	0.8243363	0.8323376	-0.0139	-0.0407673395323	0.99038682	2086	2097	2063.5136	2111.2098	1.0485495	0.9932379	0.0782	-0.10644889593	1.05568813	1758	1566	1746.5561	1570.4111	0.8430773	0.7873939	0.0986	0.0576357570491	1.07071854	11107	9010	10612.246	9152.2029	5.670292	5.2607728	0.1081	-0.0152871317951	1.07784395	15670	17694	14896.306	17896.378	7.9339689	9.7638226	-0.2994	-0.246708132866	0.81258836	8446	5330	8101.9789	5428.187	4.0708335	2.8335515	0.5227	0.415461445056	1.43665417	3129	2852	3053.6814	2888.0838	1.3085722	1.1706437	0.1607	0.256243069322	1.11782288	2259	2254	2226.6498	2274.063	1.1380688	1.2432596	-0.1275	0.0167285016595	0.91539119	1916	2210	1899.135	2228.2663	0.9028237	0.9698617	-0.1033	-0.0969407453846	0.930878810	9267	7229	8875.8065	7344.8129	4.0167471	3.5439826	0.1807	0.137736172354	1.133399211	5657	4848	5454.5277	4934.4941	2.4222018	2.3633941	0.0355	0.0307300198292	1.024882712	5969	6790	5752.0272	6900.3396	2.5423182	3.0724942	-0.2733	-0.0368315377985	0.827444413	1982	2158	1963.5026	2174.157	0.8102659	0.8706288	-0.1037	0.00848660211885	0.930667514	9165	10943	8779.5309	11110.693	4.5965418	5.4093777	-0.2349	-0.137988945329	0.849735715	1994	1903	1975.0497	1914.4829	0.7329403	0.7361767	-0.0064	0.0534939649202	0.995603716	1676	1652	1669.044	1654.8074	0.7058543	0.6986896	0.0147	0.00380556679924	1.010254417	474	417	434.7033	466.1846	0.2136116	0.2202484	-0.0441	-0.0524228573356	0.969866318	4152	4273	4035.3713	4340.5745	1.8465986	2.0158231	-0.1265	-0.0432585720656	0.916051919	812	963	814.0487	974.2971	0.4086549	0.4599456	-0.1706	-0.0934363907653	0.888485220	969	924	975.2262	936.8941	0.5799147	0.571603	0.0208	-0.00117835503276	1.0145409!sample_table_end
