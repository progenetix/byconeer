Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481948/suppl/GSM481948_MR374.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	8693	3851	7935.2844	4457.268	1.5555335	0.8971017	-0.7941	-0.00600049704361	0.57671642	9058	8780	8275.4892	9214.8756	1.644066	1.9604816	0.2539	0.0914929512198	1.19245913	3944	3550	3308.4266	4161.0701	0.762314	0.9184801	0.2689	0.0786484973124	1.20485794	18626	18035	17183.881	18104.313	3.6583578	3.9383417	0.1064	0.00126930163725	1.07653265	20809	21253	19139.918	21201.824	4.8178559	4.946971	0.0382	-0.121647708636	1.02679926	10172	8547	9301.0557	8992.2669	2.3593248	2.1709551	-0.1200	-0.0936105952099	0.92015957	2694	2512	2185.1302	3070.1857	0.6267493	0.7894897	0.3330	0.0995214388896	1.25965778	5372	3464	4675.2413	4073.8881	0.9534468	0.8612614	-0.1467	-0.174312177958	0.90331359	6827	3583	6074.7605	4194.4498	1.1276166	0.8412288	-0.4227	-0.207499165319	0.746023710	16626	14920	15379.943	15128.898	3.5910987	3.5775738	-0.0054	0.0653504793156	0.996233711	22586	17012	20706.616	17130.311	4.4802459	3.8923886	-0.2029	-0.149119209089	0.86878912	11229	14224	10326.797	14459.463	2.8318114	3.6570473	0.3690	-0.194090409329	1.291416213	5145	3548	4457.5315	4159.0468	1.2608401	1.0931391	-0.2059	-0.164567657377	0.866992614	17736	15899	16379.157	16068.193	3.7146773	3.6940191	-0.0080	-0.192562145971	0.994438715	5285	4152	4591.6838	4751.7423	1.0792735	1.0481043	-0.0423	-0.0183338499263	0.971120116	3624	3085	3011.518	3688.146	0.8188566	0.9139524	0.1585	-0.233698978757	1.116132417	1292	776	1010.2297	1053.9723	0.2042264	0.2234952	0.1301	0.235269000371	1.094350118	7779	7237	7043.3383	7750.1998	1.7313518	1.7634797	0.0265	0.0738979516817	1.018556419	4786	2253	4124.8119	2796.5692	0.817905	0.6035078	-0.4386	-0.166370608345	0.737870220	3650	2341	3035.3923	2891.1978	0.7519103	0.7468383	-0.0098	-0.243711314924	0.9932545!sample_table_end
