Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481919/suppl/GSM481919_MR343.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2668	3667	2806.199	3480.9276	1.088133	1.3704352	-0.3328	-0.118091102391	0.79400542	2678	2768	2816.2137	2607.2659	1.3699266	1.2845411	0.0928	0.0358856823488	1.06647153	2198	2298	2332.9104	2147.0769	0.8029869	0.7545943	0.0897	-0.115477159712	1.06413054	16817	16558	16156.593	16508.156	4.953815	5.2307826	-0.0785	-0.202855321535	0.94705045	15566	18043	15007.242	18031.151	6.3934038	7.5809438	-0.2458	-0.289354767107	0.84335196	12904	11273	12562.492	11099.806	4.8849253	4.4223109	0.1435	0.0298267188804	1.10460927	1596	1652	1721.1525	1535.3051	1.1042353	0.9568159	0.2067	0.0795053664848	1.15407288	3710	3796	3836.8027	3608.3769	1.1731135	1.1645976	0.0105	0.0471079589277	1.00731229	2458	3285	2594.6131	3103.5601	1.1600046	1.4061587	-0.2776	-0.0872330382337	0.824945710	11549	10559	11298.132	10376.384	4.1858014	4.0027319	0.0645	-0.0569622970732	1.045736111	10466	12027	10289.509	11868.264	3.3274435	4.0354137	-0.2783	-0.203565212419	0.824560712	6583	8041	6616.3579	7830.3099	3.2924038	3.8332964	-0.2194	-0.312106265898	0.858896213	1418	1885	1532.3562	1756.0083	0.845286	0.9522133	-0.1718	-0.101826667379	0.887706614	8841	11539	8759.2503	11370.781	5.0837269	6.50329	-0.3553	-0.294141640227	0.781716115	1538	1882	1659.4821	1753.1854	0.6577672	0.7141387	-0.1186	-0.0551430231191	0.921063616	1020	1631	1114.8277	1515.3265	0.5852732	0.7684361	-0.3928	-0.17877000685	0.76164217	618	569	663.9353	563.1933	0.3237461	0.2806123	0.2063	0.141897700679	1.153713218	3964	4020	4089.2206	3828.5458	2.0884441	1.87799	0.1532	0.0783443598497	1.112063419	1005	1422	1098.8562	1320.5428	0.4988242	0.6185613	-0.3104	-0.164716753964	0.806426420	2182	2704	2316.8282	2545.4858	0.7663423	0.8684416	-0.1804	-0.16881258056	0.8824338!sample_table_end
