Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481782/suppl/GSM481782_JBH558.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	930	1040	916.9291	1029.1938	1.5463933	1.5573853	0.0102	-0.0256079593213	1.00710812	491	505	421.267	554.4655	0.8207195	0.9693154	0.2401	0.226339342316	1.18105563	616	467	562.9635	521.475	0.7975316	0.6800003	-0.2300	-0.201820086165	0.85263114	3575	2859	3594.4051	2733.5875	4.1139862	3.1322862	-0.3933	-0.044924386486	0.76137495	3915	6019	3919.8418	5885.3392	7.2158197	10.849405	0.5884	0.0972808266733	1.50355826	2755	2649	2797.0666	2533.2464	4.6326319	3.958347	-0.2269	-0.107089394334	0.85444887	458	378	380.2414	443.4396	0.651436	0.7381574	0.1803	0.180356419294	1.13312338	979	871	971.8022	876.6441	0.849762	0.8336113	-0.0277	-0.020051177425	0.98099389	1076	1072	1078.464	1057.9809	1.970371	1.7267394	-0.1904	-0.00462168185845	0.876352410	4863	4570	4815.9364	4422.2523	3.6745546	3.7828188	0.0419	0.244305237438	1.029463211	7712	5008	7435.5312	4859.9798	5.6801211	4.1210639	-0.4629	-0.161346457139	0.725523912	3087	2887	3121.6227	2760.349	3.0970734	2.6330069	-0.2342	0.113350449817	0.850159613	854	816	831.2376	827.7016	0.7378937	0.806112	0.1276	0.0978819169184	1.0924514	674	771	629.3079	787.7411	1.6546405	1.7544558	0.0845	-0.110241638008	1.060324415	752	658	716.5873	687.3677	0.6223505	0.6452105	0.0520	-0.0183268072203	1.036731716	719	816	679.0723	827.7016	0.7523364	0.8266028	0.1358	0.172140177193	1.098714317	355	150	258.8985	224.1714	0.4991423	0.395682	-0.3351	-0.127430424953	0.792723818	644	701	595.2482	725.3261	1.4363328	1.5951883	0.1513	0.114692177768	1.110597919	443	442	361.9815	499.5244	0.5641817	0.7255934	0.3630	0.185137086511	1.286098720	901	691	884.2231	716.4021	0.682671	0.6077243	-0.1678	0.0294952913866	0.8902155!sample_table_end
