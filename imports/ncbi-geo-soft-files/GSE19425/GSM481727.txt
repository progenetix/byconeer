Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481727/suppl/GSM481727_JBH375.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3827	3420	3675.3232	3555.7287	0.9920932	0.904455	0.1334	0.119515810964	1.0968962	7685	7335	7243.9389	7616.1367	1.9765089	2.0569669	-0.0576	0.0218912987318	0.96088513	3686	3577	3544.3464	3722.3049	0.9842471	0.9177142	0.1010	0.0601549071495	1.07249844	19606	17782	17554.834	18516.613	4.7029712	4.6146671	0.0273	-0.0056828448317	1.01913555	25560	21260	22416.089	22157.258	5.9298877	5.6259906	0.0759	0.091314748172	1.05401666	12754	10043	11740.94	10430.495	3.453284	2.8839762	0.2599	0.247571017422	1.19740377	6289	5634	5977.7518	5869.1352	1.5723573	1.2279992	0.3566	0.25896194647	1.2804228	3934	3502	3774.3659	3642.714	0.9541192	0.9148913	0.0606	0.0768500674325	1.04287719	4016	3660	3849.7153	3809.6321	0.9597948	0.9463695	0.0203	-0.0507562275519	1.014186110	17781	11994	16031.427	12459.643	3.3609481	2.8778544	0.2239	0.0531452654669	1.167865911	14824	14281	13520.095	14852.814	2.9780901	3.4290563	-0.2034	-0.328686117387	0.868486712	18584	20493	16700.471	21344.527	3.6593421	4.3064356	-0.2349	0.0361849738009	0.84973813	7497	5194	7074.0415	5399.6917	1.2375936	0.9820639	0.3336	0.145135226009	1.260196514	14630	10833	13352.39	11256.081	3.2922346	3.3352141	-0.0187	0.000522882185651	0.987113415	4610	3704	4396.0223	3855.5425	0.8626226	0.7423993	0.2165	0.121377786971	1.161938916	4306	4510	4117.5802	4675.2101	0.913301	0.9151426	-0.0029	0.0303838260189	0.997987617	1600	1026	1604.6998	1091.8334	0.4373359	0.2946255	0.5699	0.0735330364309	1.484378618	7954	6459	7486.7484	6717.968	1.5642927	1.6772039	-0.1005	-0.0013433848167	0.932678819	2594	2110	2525.655	2200.0318	0.7003148	0.5983284	0.2271	0.0381159998782	1.170452120	2493	2451	2431.0561	2558.5028	0.5908601	0.6643006	-0.1690	0.0204502851326	0.8894469!sample_table_end
