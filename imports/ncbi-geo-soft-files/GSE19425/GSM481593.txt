Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481593/suppl/GSM481593_EL655.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2821	2724	3022.976	2530.6844	0.890415	0.7841918	0.1833	-0.102782952084	1.13545562	4478	4483	4765.9474	4167.1699	1.4627179	1.2477489	0.2293	0.0144861294855	1.17228543	1514	1875	1643.5996	1748.6527	0.4708747	0.5127842	-0.1230	-0.210925018855	0.91827054	13899	15183	14220.595	14305.623	4.2064683	4.4828493	-0.0918	-0.109910213707	0.9383475	16937	27350	17138.874	26421.299	5.6285116	8.5522901	-0.6036	-0.102584494157	0.65812916	10627	11075	11039.832	10322.759	3.4962927	3.4046325	0.0383	0.0955175057434	1.02692217	2066	2870	2222.3601	2663.801	1.0289634	1.138922	-0.1465	-0.0314933544971	0.90345378	2281	2994	2447.9674	2779.2672	0.7541111	0.8756306	-0.2155	0.0223146853602	0.86122059	4052	4439	4312.6444	4125.8347	1.2638328	1.1648313	0.1177	0.00399879738813	1.084992110	14641	16223	14931.11	15329.686	5.1290119	5.5706366	-0.1192	-0.0712287307576	0.920722711	8841	11295	9264.8826	10532.543	3.0347157	3.5607224	-0.2306	-0.238320954426	0.852275312	5683	7272	6029.4526	6756.0419	2.4958656	2.6797119	-0.1025	-0.147130357654	0.931393213	1175	1400	1281.184	1309.4599	0.4797881	0.4868792	-0.0212	-0.132281619045	0.985435614	10036	10366	10457.108	9649.5669	3.6194982	3.1614666	0.1952	-0.0218296945987	1.144879415	1403	1538	1528.6087	1435.1133	0.5195116	0.4855767	0.0975	-0.0615321294705	1.069885616	1034	1730	1134.9546	1613.6767	0.4907703	0.6659288	-0.4403	-0.144373333624	0.736971117	363	380	376.85714	380.69553	0.1146271	0.116453	-0.0228	-0.10516518244	0.984320618	4521	5124	4811.075	4766.9656	1.4059307	1.3776007	0.0294	-0.0775632854426	1.020564719	1257	1523	1369.7316	1421.347	0.4077862	0.4218546	-0.0489	-0.137089368143	0.966651120	2458	2579	2636.855	2398.8309	0.8606256	0.8271763	0.0572	-0.0471770888608	1.0404379!sample_table_end
