Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481543/suppl/GSM481543_EL163.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4383	3777	4296.2244	3777.8446	1.1377399	0.9987643	0.1880	0.145043247271	1.13914752	6013	5264	5852.0884	5243.0824	1.84939	1.7382598	0.0894	-0.0595305991457	1.06393193	3378	4316	3342.0346	4309.1787	0.9656228	1.0718112	-0.1505	-0.128768105036	0.90092614	20070	16977	18009.789	16744.135	4.5545434	4.4100554	0.0465	-0.100636823619	1.03276335	16222	16176	14721.341	15963.841	5.4375077	4.4820395	0.2788	0.0128565402083	1.21317716	6714	8687	6491.7902	8635.9273	2.0847633	2.3710598	-0.1856	-0.129382343155	0.87925377	1583	2000	1613.0113	2021.9513	0.6304765	0.6881954	-0.1264	-0.199528834926	0.91613018	2670	2636	2661.4395	2644.7088	0.6731578	0.762022	-0.1789	-0.181467504999	0.88338369	2296	1978	2301.7062	2000.4742	0.6897181	0.6425395	0.1022	0.118815255927	1.073425110	16519	12137	14975.503	12017.638	4.3190788	4.1744307	0.0491	0.0915904390129	1.03465111	17770	15538	16040.588	15344.035	4.3027681	4.9651647	-0.2066	-0.164755081715	0.866591212	12502	14248	11561.692	14092.434	4.0164828	4.9116404	-0.2903	-0.242242873043	0.817747713	4331	3709	4248.7035	3709.4199	1.4636745	1.4422589	0.0213	0.137802392973	1.014848614	10675	11505	10012.931	11401.272	4.1618696	3.8886908	0.0979	-0.048316530971	1.070249515	3118	2792	3083.681	2795.0227	0.9398501	0.9181316	0.0337	0.138163471342	1.023655116	2700	3268	2688.438	3263.3153	0.9406542	1.0944224	-0.2184	0.0291632222074	0.859498317	647	622	701.6307	662.1512	0.2125364	0.2133917	-0.0058	-0.0527046270078	0.995991818	3028	5620	2995.7376	5593.285	1.2368758	1.5889963	-0.3614	-0.278339434011	0.778400719	2664	2235	2656.0362	2253.7875	0.8089742	0.7728076	0.0660	0.032482172199	1.04679920	3075	2216	3040.8481	2234.9085	0.794079	0.7507778	0.0809	0.11553776495	1.057675!sample_table_end
