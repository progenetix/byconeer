Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481577/suppl/GSM481577_EL639.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3000	2514	2900.0345	2595.0054	0.7351708	0.6639583	0.1470	-0.0572344472191	1.10725442	3983	3875	3861.2312	3960.5369	1.0506605	1.0456935	0.0068	-0.0196736558941	1.00474993	2799	2465	2701.8858	2545.1362	0.8531485	0.793274	0.1050	-0.141152279183	1.07547774	16494	15661	15768.725	15870.924	5.4660016	5.563397	-0.0255	-0.0825716054917	0.98249355	9571	17028	9241.956	17292.547	3.0246067	5.3505169	-0.8229	-0.140164219259	0.56529246	13168	11896	12658.847	12034.337	4.2603653	4.0280421	0.0809	-0.0310430429184	1.05767647	1525	2045	1461.693	2126.2986	0.7150677	0.9346601	-0.3864	-0.107649000929	0.76505638	2284	1808	2200.5794	1884.1636	1.0226197	0.8975874	0.1881	0.0629351404415	1.13929819	5397	4994	5220.0671	5077.5793	1.3694237	1.283284	0.0937	0.0202074628939	1.067124310	11083	10078	10681.117	10190.117	5.4884542	5.6009601	-0.0293	-0.0357789753202	0.979913111	5308	4159	5133.9009	4244.2528	2.7778823	2.4147317	0.2021	-0.0761194358818	1.150389612	5359	4880	5183.3331	4964.3394	3.4390726	3.237326	0.0872	-0.080009007517	1.062318813	1669	1581	1603.7957	1657.219	1.2387381	1.211082	0.0326	-0.0697798321613	1.022835814	6435	8268	6230.0623	8375.354	1.8284293	2.0102188	-0.1367	-0.189126344216	0.909567315	1608	1318	1543.9107	1393.3241	1.1165475	1.0107201	0.1437	-0.0434782798264	1.104704916	2001	2027	1929.2803	2108.4351	1.0819875	1.1521184	-0.0906	0.0189729469473	0.939128717	1411	1226	1349.1539	1299.8515	0.3611486	0.3420429	0.0784	-0.173063768393	1.055857718	4585	4731	4438.4725	4817.5166	1.4351682	1.3439424	0.0947	-0.080129957498	1.067879319	3327	2933	3223.1657	3008.9773	0.8713824	0.8414136	0.0505	-0.102540549278	1.035617120	3317	2533	3213.3382	2614.3383	1.6679694	1.5150972	0.1387	-0.0821625520308	1.1008993!sample_table_end
