Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481515/suppl/GSM481515_DE434.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3025	3518	3438.5793	3100.6224	0.8834565	0.7563417	0.2241	0.144990666721	1.16806542	3581	4272	4000.8187	3827.5565	1.4891804	1.1742811	0.3427	0.351245783301	1.26816343	3949	4283	4360.9013	3838.5119	0.9465083	0.8453279	0.1631	0.172383822078	1.11969374	15177	9603	12953.557	9705.8197	3.1095799	2.3300498	0.4164	0.289618015182	1.33455515	19609	13560	15883.037	14209.086	3.4225547	2.9018542	0.2381	0.196926013128	1.17943716	12445	16155	11127.172	17090.088	2.6533409	4.0443047	-0.6081	-0.633166880291	0.65606857	6310	6767	6489.3514	6454.3868	1.4393364	1.4989976	-0.0586	-0.214726304881	0.96019928	3702	4289	4120.4045	3844.4871	0.9661934	0.9263578	0.0607	0.0621721500769	1.04300239	2456	3886	2836.3033	3443.6299	1.0393723	1.0300719	0.0130	-0.0785874959485	1.009028810	8423	9766	8223.9098	9887.429	2.074997	2.7715295	-0.4176	-0.355582796355	0.748682911	15217	13246	12979.983	13855.017	3.057141	3.4653646	-0.1808	-0.106526975872	0.882198912	15700	12637	13297.822	13144.904	2.8520036	2.9353608	-0.0416	0.105928918765	0.971602313	3793	4564	4209.8505	4118.8645	1.1127213	1.2321024	-0.1470	-0.199518397878	0.903107814	7118	7919	7177.8255	7783.9695	2.7227391	2.2816733	0.2550	0.181183733866	1.19330815	4063	4402	4470.3626	3957.2258	0.8899101	0.8246616	0.1099	0.0626489454687	1.079121516	3153	3809	3569.0804	3368.7862	0.7134266	0.7165834	-0.0064	0.0169711971932	0.995594617	887	1613	1115.8792	1376.9686	0.3788286	0.4095819	-0.1126	-0.14593472202	0.924915418	5709	8437	5965.2232	8386.6078	1.4795722	1.9313625	-0.3844	-0.350490800776	0.766076919	1449	2555	1755.8375	2212.1744	0.6379709	0.7091778	-0.1527	-0.113057602204	0.899592320	1330	1404	1621.6796	1200.8404	0.4892623	0.4002706	0.2896	0.126877201877	1.2223285!sample_table_end
