Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481545/suppl/GSM481545_EL167.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5125	4003	4842.5655	4194.2898	1.4721875	1.2855858	0.1955	0.11077400883	1.14514912	4317	4190	4080.6267	4387.064	1.1729324	1.3578412	-0.2112	-0.328665082123	0.86382143	3466	3324	3276.4906	3485.7212	1.2123328	1.2661068	-0.0626	-0.104153879768	0.9575284	11155	9290	10399.675	9649.3644	3.4884801	3.3996449	0.0372	-0.150082526252	1.02613075	15948	14250	14837.708	14692.336	5.1800324	4.8782237	0.0866	-0.133459848196	1.06186856	6427	5504	6057.8155	5745.6291	2.4183827	2.2688206	0.0921	0.0755346848243	1.06592067	2182	2103	2091.3649	2210.1384	0.7599883	0.6941264	0.1308	0.007856262301	1.09488468	2641	2439	2519.8928	2564.1086	0.787718	0.8352058	-0.0845	-0.0954267939854	0.94314249	4151	3670	3919.711	3849.2784	1.0659173	1.145236	-0.1035	-0.142127069763	0.930740210	8361	8548	7834.5452	8887.6479	2.5514701	2.898748	-0.1841	-0.00853619576206	0.880197311	16259	14380	15129.475	14822.136	4.8140751	4.8552903	-0.0123	-0.0106995651785	0.991511212	10233	9837	9552.1743	10217.189	3.3322724	3.3131945	0.0083	-0.0948786866678	1.005758113	5345	5792	5046.3698	6043.2111	1.7353362	1.9111615	-0.1392	-0.0809284878884	0.908000814	14082	11663	13109.5	12072.477	3.9093085	3.6012085	0.1184	-0.154109249616	1.085554615	3683	4147	3479.079	4342.5577	1.1015037	1.3368955	-0.2794	-0.118729632857	0.823926516	3198	3948	3031.7818	4138.1136	1.0079843	1.2393918	-0.2982	-0.0243929527817	0.813289417	1989	1527	1913.2974	1604.1934	0.5505873	0.4982659	0.1441	0.0814658918327	1.10500718	5145	5646	4860.93	5892.0726	1.6156706	1.8384773	-0.1864	-0.0300987798194	0.87880919	2916	2563	2774.4475	2694.8824	0.8547817	0.9018817	-0.0774	0.0484707091782	0.947775820	2613	2516	2494.0648	2645.2373	0.7061858	0.807686	-0.1937	-0.203652500909	0.8743321!sample_table_end
