Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481529/suppl/GSM481529_DE493.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1837	1470	1847.7513	1446.9989	0.7578507	0.5970122	-0.3442	0.141149455995	0.78777012	2731	2463	2669.495	2468.9229	1.572155	1.5560099	-0.0149	-0.0039277555374	0.98973063	1971	2049	1969.239	2040.3367	0.8849471	0.6958996	-0.3467	0.333710984639	0.78637424	11339	11234	10215.552	11730.397	4.6420561	4.2507029	-0.1271	0.0544446742097	0.9156945	23292	18179	19862.263	18982.333	5.2025753	5.9319336	0.1893	-0.201744008649	1.14019186	5478	7761	5161.8254	8056.028	2.8424309	3.1657726	0.1554	-0.158985245406	1.11375537	1461	1998	1498.3224	1989.43	0.9664942	0.96379	-0.0040	0.0321850743452	0.9972028	2375	2253	2347.185	2248.473	0.9049688	0.94357	0.0603	-0.0606603284421	1.04265479	1240	1403	1289.2656	1382.087	0.7365843	0.8766312	0.2511	-0.246157156343	1.190130310	10950	6710	9887.429	6950.7797	5.5910298	4.39267	-0.3480	0.220454281353	0.785663811	7938	6704	7305.6013	6944.5713	2.9307634	3.4190985	0.2223	-0.0382558385628	1.166623912	7994	5457	7354.745	5627.029	3.3185715	2.8704296	-0.2093	0.356827237811	0.864959413	1046	781	1101.7213	767.5102	0.7108226	0.5401777	-0.3961	0.362555508091	0.759933314	6297	6464	5888.5055	6693.5324	3.2617219	3.7909954	0.2169	-0.147637265982	1.162268115	2680	1289	2622.5676	1269.4021	0.6827343	0.4625825	-0.5616	0.403778275126	0.677543916	1852	1944	1860.6901	1934.176	0.9099003	0.9353748	0.0398	0.182519290848	1.02799717	272	240	259.9113	266.2838	0.1478437	0.1546728	0.0651	0.0440350971893	1.046191218	5170	4880	4886.4703	5014.9838	1.8633206	1.7306363	-0.1066	0.126753660937	0.928791519	804	769	857.48323	755.855	0.5539105	0.4961916	-0.1588	0.0902815222014	0.895797420	869	910	924.2674	892.4233	0.61793	0.5441645	-0.1834	0.194408343869	0.8806248!sample_table_end
