Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481854/suppl/GSM481854_MR248.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6807	3968	6117.8996	4311.6452	1.4672739	1.1378135	-0.3669	-0.313379248384	0.77546092	7112	4332	6385.2165	4685.2706	1.5311564	1.238123	-0.3065	-0.140157478124	0.80861953	4484	2666	4086.5929	2915.4943	1.2410732	0.9251752	-0.4238	-0.213873974808	0.74546374	10677	6723	9462.9995	7201.5356	2.8994007	2.3470996	-0.3049	-0.188970329028	0.80951195	11641	8702	10307.875	9239.6558	2.7753269	2.5173392	-0.1408	-0.0455460900934	0.90704246	6691	5668	6018.9562	6104.1457	2.0937382	2.1209011	0.0186	0.0518755822973	1.01297347	2000	3208	1875.3302	3488.9372	0.6526461	0.8325833	0.3513	0.102790067266	1.2757048	3861	3146	3533.3476	3422.0686	0.8582715	0.8708269	0.0210	-0.106606054178	1.01462869	5566	3728	5025.9576	4057.1813	1.1324902	1.0261752	-0.1422	-0.193266807354	0.906122710	14071	13060	12441.286	13793.093	4.6683984	4.7852746	0.0357	0.0137408025883	1.025035611	18615	14747	16484.73	15610.421	4.4142193	3.9600494	-0.1566	-0.163701293961	0.89711212	9740	8073	8646.4921	8586.3994	2.6222355	2.001235	-0.3899	-0.289979412924	0.763178913	5659	4247	5107.155	4598.5902	1.8261086	1.7379927	-0.0714	-0.179015110278	0.951746614	10112	7750	8968.9028	8253.6332	2.2917233	2.327562	0.0224	-0.103631248747	1.015638315	4191	4204	3837.7688	4554.7085	1.0066795	0.9821896	-0.0355	-0.0847675523638	0.975672616	3916	4374	3584.119	4729.5712	1.1428365	1.0855766	-0.0742	-0.285546951427	0.949896617	1336	905	1261.9492	1012.6348	0.2962548	0.2649747	-0.1610	-0.077406290811	0.894414918	7260	5329	6515.5577	5750.974	1.6906028	1.6491684	-0.0358	-0.0752119514105	0.975491319	5839	3720	5269.0323	4048.3922	1.2682065	1.08605	-0.2237	-0.246179674587	0.856366820	2487	1444	2311.441	1606.4439	1.0353565	0.7432742	-0.4782	-0.434411714294	0.717892!sample_table_end
