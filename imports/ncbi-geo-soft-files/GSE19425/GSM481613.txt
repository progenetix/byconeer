Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481613/suppl/GSM481613_EL681.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3163	3521	3302.8876	3360.8665	0.8440046	0.8228244	0.0367	-0.0695656356096	1.02574082	3764	4603	3908.1808	4379.1135	1.2350102	1.3134599	-0.0888	-0.178882917795	0.94027253	2198	2093	2297.1011	2007.0344	0.6054702	0.5113447	0.2438	0.0506999172669	1.18407434	14426	16603	14423.71	15926.402	4.2147171	4.6164296	-0.1313	-0.342752040416	0.9129825	12823	25482	12868.721	24583.408	3.9652156	7.1349235	-0.8475	-0.184162057314	0.55574746	10009	13250	10148.338	12671.844	2.9694725	3.5772639	-0.2686	-0.326016275939	0.8300967	1848	2830	1941.4138	2701.3988	0.939518	1.2590127	-0.4223	-0.188310074573	0.74623398	1918	2403	2013.2628	2295.5933	0.6298829	0.7317669	-0.2163	-0.230724734799	0.86076979	2888	3664	3017.3797	3492.9356	0.9121295	0.9918134	-0.1208	-0.409541541073	0.919658310	15015	16260	14991.979	15596.924	4.9285056	5.6287799	-0.1917	-0.0821956019317	0.875590311	8705	8408	8867.9886	8011.8427	2.9437271	2.8125781	0.0658	-0.00728336218775	1.046629412	4822	5775	4996.7043	5504.196	2.3092287	2.5569638	-0.1470	-0.208236012579	0.903113513	1465	1368	1543.0489	1333.0308	0.6749204	0.6105263	0.1447	0.136479765198	1.105472914	4945	6658	5120.1858	6353.3088	1.8364363	2.095857	-0.1906	-0.19065535014	0.876222115	1385	1358	1459.8973	1323.9948	0.5695051	0.5320725	0.0981	0.0523705396693	1.070352416	1499	1708	1578.3665	1646.4493	0.6767661	0.7101429	-0.0695	-0.0124386297478	0.952999817	573	468	589.47112	497.92179	0.1791769	0.1443691	0.3116	0.303575498338	1.241103218	4435	5381	4602.0297	5125.4279	1.3672089	1.4271377	-0.0619	-0.0462034850835	0.958007619	1559	1652	1640.6648	1594.378	0.4850043	0.4640674	0.0637	0.00686787912416	1.04511620	2560	2459	2680.5528	2348.1242	0.7549256	0.7400059	0.0288	-0.188762318575	1.0201616!sample_table_end
