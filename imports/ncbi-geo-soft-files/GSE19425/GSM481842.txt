Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481842/suppl/GSM481842_MR222.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5571	5491	5336.2795	5680.4996	1.1529574	1.1950919	0.0518	0.0687783811502	1.03654462	6927	7361	6610.4483	7608.1222	1.4267358	1.542589	0.1126	0.147738205229	1.08120163	5860	6857	5612.0447	7086.3981	1.3166816	1.6083028	0.2886	0.166146223231	1.22148194	19426	15958	18154.002	16445.035	4.0502993	3.6370387	-0.1553	0.0344547827833	0.89796795	20101	17894	18777.399	18413.439	5.0397833	4.7736919	-0.0783	0.0623205524347	0.94720186	10545	9697	9985.4683	10026.309	2.6417972	2.5209264	-0.0676	-0.0606268804889	0.95424677	3305	3543	3204.9586	3671.1756	0.8654723	0.9301458	0.1040	0.0232498157478	1.07472628	3536	2904	3425.5133	3012.7848	0.7742935	0.6881917	-0.1701	-0.0818042749434	0.88879959	5793	7753	5547.9532	8016.482	1.1028886	1.5025447	0.4461	0.146658610559	1.362372110	13920	14497	13090.71	14944.914	2.9265755	3.5297671	0.2704	0.0226827034518	1.206108311	23511	21160	21929.819	21727.392	4.7808299	5.0741316	0.0859	-0.00135942817977	1.061349512	14313	15199	13456.357	15669.202	3.2972774	3.8061	0.2070	0.0800202810992	1.154315913	6848	8187	6537.7723	8468.7399	1.3815455	1.9037654	0.4626	0.105346729489	1.377996814	14649	16653	13769.055	17156.192	4.0238512	4.5741761	0.1849	0.179424294875	1.136765715	4196	4524	4049.9291	4677.6183	0.8678212	1.0286963	0.2453	0.179372952587	1.185378116	3925	4808	3789.8394	4970.3083	0.9435341	1.1914193	0.3365	0.0511387456345	1.262719817	2122	3331	2076.5715	3451.2442	0.4438625	0.6963986	0.6498	0.235682216136	1.56895118	4476	4666	4316.1295	4824.0266	1.4406563	1.4918853	0.0504	-0.0602989570843	1.035559419	4353	5185	4199.6211	5361.1363	0.8730589	1.0709779	0.2948	0.0662509699458	1.226695920	4659	3970	4488.6338	4103.2917	0.7465119	0.7632934	0.0321	-0.00595053196875	1.0224799!sample_table_end
