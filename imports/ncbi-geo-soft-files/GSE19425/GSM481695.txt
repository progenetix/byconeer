Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481695/suppl/GSM481695_JBH095.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1951	1794	1985.1648	1769.5766	0.9430001	0.8477805	0.1536	-0.0783201073784	1.11231632	1788	2669	1790.9746	2490.1623	0.843044	1.1339559	-0.4277	-0.484612773832	0.74345393	1652	1666	1623.1913	1663.4973	0.9158656	0.9351347	-0.0300	-0.15175769586	0.97939434	2683	4872	2860.2012	4306.496	1.8224309	2.8456162	-0.6429	-0.804048209089	0.64043455	4369	8985	4840.3539	7715.436	3.0902581	4.8693747	-0.6560	-0.653163102466	0.63463146	2692	5718	2870.8043	5009.5393	1.6137004	2.838375	-0.8147	-0.808036027655	0.56852967	813	712	602.6699	858.7939	0.5115275	0.8532536	-0.7382	-0.656343788321	0.59950238	1228	968	1110.3522	1088.1499	0.8436565	0.8412876	0.0041	-0.275508402891	1.00281589	1554	2336	1501.2653	2216.3386	0.6805509	0.9609651	-0.4978	-0.367297124085	0.708195210	3173	4746	3444.6251	4201.5681	3.1660775	4.0222471	-0.3453	-0.275389923489	0.787141411	4178	5382	4619.0107	4731.4343	4.1492736	4.2948676	-0.0498	-0.076274343623	0.966100412	1168	1349	1038.8483	1401.9244	0.9518341	1.3452933	-0.4991	-0.620336988599	0.70752913	1347	1077	1249.3316	1178.4965	1.3848395	1.4170794	-0.0332	0.0350291152783	0.97724914	3112	5581	3371.4538	4896.4438	1.9008416	2.4341901	-0.3568	-0.44706234938	0.780892815	1157	917	1025.844	1045.1052	0.9186918	0.9676862	-0.0750	-0.0368582372591	0.949369516	1337	1081	1237.607	1181.7429	1.1113871	1.1291705	-0.0229	0.0396523370532	0.984250917	1232	736	1115.1547	881.5137	0.5004272	0.4044791	0.3071	0.213824544296	1.23721418	1728	2717	1718.52	2529.1125	0.9726004	1.3309055	-0.4525	-0.495369987967	0.730780919	1876	1998	1895.433	1937.5065	0.9062503	0.9179655	-0.0185	-0.103302331239	0.987237920	858	547	655.425	705.7525	0.5306931	0.5765519	-0.1196	-0.179393969103	0.9204601!sample_table_end
