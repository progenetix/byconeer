Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481868/suppl/GSM481868_MR278.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3444	3407	3529.4813	3278.1065	1.0951253	1.0342382	-0.0825	-0.0922838496935	0.94440172	5530	4315	5643.6086	4137.7781	2.1186464	1.5259641	-0.4734	-0.147251076565	0.72025433	2464	1993	2534.051	1964.5627	0.8479121	0.6587073	-0.3643	-0.168408375857	0.77685814	14034	11847	13869.387	11175.453	4.5910738	3.7385413	-0.2964	-0.168092819144	0.81430655	16248	13494	15949.08	12685.834	5.4589325	4.30384	-0.3430	-0.327985179577	0.78840326	8694	8980	8748.0471	8499.6724	3.131603	3.0046033	-0.0597	-0.197544767929	0.95944587	2108	3077	2157.8713	2977.3682	0.8994284	0.9602597	0.0944	-0.032283862625	1.06763338	2735	2923	2812.1799	2831.0809	0.972363	0.9874154	0.0222	-0.126488708801	1.01548029	3108	3173	3188.5386	3065.9957	1.0671993	1.0464748	-0.0283	-0.0983045856605	0.980580510	11633	10632	11574.898	10040.605	4.057746	3.8336917	-0.0819	-0.0525786078765	0.944783611	8828	7590	8877.0001	7207.5407	2.981716	2.6339013	-0.1789	-0.24047302577	0.883350912	7926	7724	8004.9767	7332.5371	3.2045802	2.4796018	-0.3700	-0.257892040669	0.773768113	2608	3098	2682.1472	2996.7663	1.087291	1.1273067	0.0521	-0.151741171893	1.036803214	8861	8632	8908.7441	8174.819	4.0430146	3.1777971	-0.3474	-0.262539571287	0.785996915	1716	1872	1753.0333	1854.6427	0.6322875	0.6334887	0.0027	-0.00232916265508	1.001899816	2132	2530	2182.9641	2461.3294	0.8336935	0.7698677	-0.1149	-0.209826863248	0.923442217	759	651	720.6863	723.7776	0.2714657	0.271711	0.0013	0.104891487439	1.000903618	3953	4569	4050.3347	4381.1311	1.7218591	1.5770316	-0.1268	-0.128433233602	0.915888919	1319	1391	1338.8392	1412.0524	0.4782007	0.5306335	0.1501	0.0165714835621	1.109646120	2993	1898	3074.6394	1878.4886	1.0197806	0.7490078	-0.4452	-0.310133195853	0.7344794!sample_table_end
