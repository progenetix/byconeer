Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481522/suppl/GSM481522_DE485.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6967	7233	7219.3799	6863.1868	1.5532679	1.3851152	-0.1653	0.070102958856	0.89174262	4122	6266	4297.6054	5957.9856	1.2945108	1.387589	0.1002	-0.0509041463602	1.07190213	8749	8347	9009.9932	7918.7059	1.5389745	1.4634545	-0.0726	0.0635275162325	0.95092834	13618	13479	13655.026	12885.852	2.5251769	2.5552243	0.0171	-0.181047358138	1.01189915	22971	19840	22088.415	19522.092	3.9794326	3.8017202	-0.0659	-0.190447376482	0.95534226	14838	14195	14801.823	13591.65	2.744783	2.7070809	-0.0200	0.0500887332808	0.9862647	5594	5585	5812.2203	5312.5613	1.1249001	1.1191354	-0.0074	0.0126979560688	0.99487548	3268	3140	3410.1383	3040.245	0.6521423	0.6252948	-0.0607	-0.0912266199566	0.95883179	4505	7207	4689.8886	6838.849	1.453711	1.4852411	0.0310	0.135183773439	1.021689410	24017	21264	22994.442	21079.627	5.7632797	5.3915452	-0.0962	0.144990275295	0.935499411	29919	26280	28048.639	26651.872	6.6123916	6.5628838	-0.0108	0.107407872277	0.992512812	12935	13903	13004.715	13300.486	2.7196203	3.0372223	0.1593	-0.118388375737	1.116781713	7405	6992	7662.8956	6637.5804	2.0700092	1.8212786	-0.1847	0.309199358908	0.879840814	8942	12167	9200.1236	11596.952	2.6799499	2.5334632	-0.0811	-0.0151497741763	0.945339715	6470	6447	6717.2056	6126.9906	1.4563145	1.3884544	-0.0688	0.184470101874	0.953402816	8836	8151	9095.775	7731.2351	1.8177573	1.6903013	-0.1049	0.0377277245419	0.929882817	2266	2684	2364.1215	2624.07	0.6108705	0.5799397	-0.0750	0.326691043348	0.94936618	11210	11238	11372.343	10697.876	2.0822923	2.0218901	-0.0425	-0.00366171621935	0.970992419	6023	6783	6252.1441	6441.7314	1.8533613	1.5576924	-0.2507	-0.00298145036476	0.840468820	1971	2085	2055.309	2054.8631	0.5277723	0.5029489	-0.0695	0.00835106070031	0.9529656!sample_table_end
