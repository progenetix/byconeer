Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481495/suppl/GSM481495_DE404.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1884	1462	1492.6902	1777.4812	1.2536795	1.2817334	-0.0319	0.00397692895533	0.97811262	1015	651	709.0616	891.8141	0.7542475	0.8204522	-0.1214	0.119197056766	0.9193073	2948	1804	2346.4084	2150.4396	1.4710463	1.3437618	0.1306	0.141426251046	1.09472254	3420	2102	2713.9472	2491.0506	2.0468301	1.8006723	0.1849	0.164913167952	1.13670335	10257	5159	7523.0857	5998.4817	4.1952829	3.6251447	0.2107	0.0926673760728	1.15727326	5918	5103	4577.8408	5932.5281	2.9933997	3.8634237	-0.3681	-0.203788395044	0.77480497	2413	1327	1921.712	1628.526	1.1253298	1.2026442	-0.0959	-0.206601929997	0.9357138	1270	882	957.4642	1146.6003	0.8156564	0.9301881	-0.1896	-0.217577461129	0.87687259	1077	987	768.6126	1257.3956	0.7523037	1.1445019	-0.6053	-0.283262936929	0.657319710	3779	3198	2989.0313	3723.5653	3.2414963	4.2233171	-0.3817	0.0868704339188	0.767523811	6895	4456	5270.0224	5175.6817	4.8008188	5.1649898	-0.1055	0.20799352451	0.929492412	2466	1107	1964.1234	1388.1667	1.8656171	1.400458	0.4138	0.294267019192	1.332147813	1392	794	1067.1236	1051.8972	1.8765373	1.9340815	-0.0436	0.202435525936	0.970247314	3247	2062	2578.7968	2444.2967	2.0226502	1.9434297	0.0576	0.11459597215	1.040763315	1715	899	1348.3082	1164.3818	1.2283805	1.1199638	0.1333	0.177173966906	1.096803716	2050	1219	1630.8495	1511.9789	1.3651631	1.3573371	0.0083	0.0753713415105	1.005765717	968	539	664.4059	763.8016	0.6623386	0.6408182	0.0477	-0.0420550698117	1.033582718	5840	3143	4521.1775	3661.6754	2.0885281	2.026222	0.0437	0.0447994859407	1.030749919	1708	1326	1342.4498	1627.4438	1.1943467	1.4687187	-0.2983	-0.0313995329079	0.813189620	973	486	669.1538	703.2254	0.8753188	0.8454296	0.0501	-0.0987301532912	1.0353538!sample_table_end
