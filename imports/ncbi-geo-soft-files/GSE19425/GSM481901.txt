Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481901/suppl/GSM481901_MR315.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3961	4000	4321.5663	3631.9052	1.4011503	1.1323929	0.3072	0.201917103399	1.23733582	4012	4291	4376.4624	3896.0864	1.5524261	1.246325	0.3168	0.14788496355	1.24560293	3731	3155	4075.0772	2861.755	1.2646121	0.8795129	0.5239	0.101644429001	1.4378554	11556	12078	12170.807	11119.873	3.4090341	3.1313583	0.1226	-0.102324716795	1.08867585	14705	19106	15394.881	17586.604	5.2518668	5.9414175	-0.1780	-0.255446561958	0.88394176	6396	8499	6859.7383	7795.6032	2.3545125	2.6773624	-0.1854	-0.13463333865	0.87941497	2999	3363	3313.8169	3053.134	0.7684053	0.9137613	-0.2499	-0.148836713239	0.84092568	3006	3877	3321.3945	3519.2972	0.8353431	0.8940059	-0.0979	-0.00710524107479	0.93438219	4130	6132	4502.4603	5601.8583	1.5277472	1.6882282	-0.1441	-0.0204706332427	0.904941110	14307	16797	14989.834	15464.778	3.6097247	3.786335	-0.0689	-0.123678324311	0.953355811	18048	26070	18826.943	23981.985	4.6038092	6.0060498	-0.3836	-0.25620821272	0.766528612	10617	12028	11211.235	11074.271	2.7473228	2.9663468	-0.1107	-0.257714575951	0.926163713	9644	8354	10207.196	7662.5009	1.9702465	1.9628635	0.0054	-0.0131959916389	1.003761314	9120	11589	9666.9846	10665.126	4.5411784	4.7047648	-0.0511	-0.142027967519	0.965229615	4515	5090	4904.1781	4630.7076	1.2162524	1.1286309	0.1079	0.0581049078954	1.077635116	4784	5031	5183.4715	4575.8592	1.1132103	1.2408596	-0.1566	-0.0606694015023	0.897128317	1663	2457	1868.3878	2222.9198	0.6495036	0.7085485	-0.1255	-0.0240090860196	0.916667918	3451	4329	3780.645	3930.3004	1.691466	1.6570298	0.0297	0.016562213113	1.020781819	3229	4265	3552.773	3872.6782	1.156892	1.1576804	-0.0010	-0.0100155957734	0.999318920	3205	2984	3528.0982	2703.5806	0.7760936	0.6172316	0.3304	0.0866166646666	1.257378!sample_table_end
