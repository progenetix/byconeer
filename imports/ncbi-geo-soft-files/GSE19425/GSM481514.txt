Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481514/suppl/GSM481514_DE431.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3924	2268	2950.649	3093.2682	0.6657055	0.6492413	-0.0361	0.0133584892288	0.9752682	4407	3915	3303.7729	5106.746	1.0405162	1.2829542	0.3022	0.378599846907	1.23299783	6667	4791	5122.0417	6116.6745	0.8621713	1.1349335	0.3966	0.405652496914	1.31636664	17756	12809	14727.969	13622.808	2.7871512	2.8017839	0.0076	0.0437955128234	1.005255	28773	25233	23466.154	23359.515	3.7552674	4.3955538	0.2271	0.264839890475	1.17050356	28718	12195	23424.991	13095.817	4.2211586	2.5639424	-0.7193	-0.678740639585	0.60740257	8142	4074	6352.497	5288.7418	1.4184202	1.2104027	-0.2288	-0.168762565703	0.85334568	5479	3624	4148.3711	4767.1203	0.8147388	1.0153349	0.3175	0.195935392543	1.24620919	4992	3123	3764.7889	4157.0205	1.1758759	0.9882247	-0.2508	-0.0173976031094	0.840415710	17318	7305	14362.792	8706.8227	3.3752741	2.1062707	-0.6803	-0.534316077835	0.624029511	19177	13202	15903.348	13952.528	3.4532784	3.1126007	-0.1498	-0.0765372153268	0.901346612	15458	15932	12778.211	16160.738	2.890786	3.7660945	0.3816	0.226385587224	1.302792513	5325	2760	4027.0787	3716.6826	1.0182555	0.8886415	-0.1964	-0.189752449599	0.872709714	12068	12283	9802.2079	13171.557	2.7475781	2.753912	0.0033	0.151476471359	1.002305215	5290	2716	3999.5331	3660.031	0.8123487	0.7644562	-0.0877	0.0158347963407	0.941044416	4160	2365	3121.1851	3218.9664	0.6845899	0.7183049	0.0694	0.0426056782661	1.049248417	1758	1142	1368.5637	1612.7129	0.4020524	0.3766285	-0.0942	0.0477606039183	0.936764618	13689	6488	11231.633	7887.2997	1.9808289	1.4527098	-0.4474	-0.506103084978	0.733384719	2725	1636	2061.1387	2272.6386	0.6693975	0.6083354	-0.1380	-0.107725855578	0.908780520	2486	1219	1893.2732	1717.1136	0.4475277	0.4060139	-0.1404	-0.0647319755309	0.9072375!sample_table_end
