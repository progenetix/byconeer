Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481582/suppl/GSM481582_EL644.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3482	4061	3881.9446	3616.2969	1.073169	0.971129	-0.1441	0.00199156367294	0.90491712	4374	6542	4834.3567	5891.3591	1.7077398	1.8866657	0.1438	0.157693876202	1.10477353	1819	2024	2049.9453	1815.2167	0.4878699	0.4482731	-0.1221	-0.182132082156	0.91883754	18838	21554	18921.983	20697.87	4.7626455	5.009525	0.0729	0.0875991610047	1.05183665	12874	23890	13360.325	23094.657	3.7336978	6.2264483	0.7378	0.0442549144303	1.66763586	11175	14105	11730.297	13165.491	3.1272573	3.6061161	0.2055	0.381045765156	1.15312417	2268	4070	2551.6799	3624.2032	0.8622264	1.1734183	0.4446	-0.023364173373	1.36091668	2769	3479	3105.3305	3100.717	0.9222119	0.8937306	-0.0453	0.149868447088	0.96911639	3270	4243	3656.3783	3775.9068	1.2452455	1.1894017	-0.0662	0.147921162508	0.955154410	14423	15315	14829.135	14364.34	4.5649315	4.3317722	-0.0756	-0.132552066489	0.948923811	9551	7751	10149.112	7011.4243	3.0157905	2.0533987	-0.5545	-0.439741302727	0.680882412	6801	5951	7368.5195	5336.02	2.1771124	1.5250066	-0.5136	-0.492246757816	0.700472113	1550	1631	1747.6599	1477.1688	0.5538137	0.4601287	-0.2674	-0.192466705911	0.830836614	4666	4663	5148.1192	4150.7376	1.8047975	1.3874578	-0.3794	-0.335789103697	0.768760915	1691	1768	1904.5699	1595.1757	0.5145634	0.4171088	-0.3029	-0.266002460594	0.810607216	1300	1690	1468.2104	1528.1518	0.4365838	0.4448071	0.0269	-0.308699079211	1.018835617	428	363	426.5605	381.7482	0.1436785	0.1182504	-0.2810	-0.162103619219	0.823020918	4863	5195	5364.4862	4642.8814	1.4094116	1.246264	-0.1775	-0.0945471679487	0.884244119	1421	1662	1604.9684	1503.9722	0.5661161	0.499091	-0.1818	-0.174870681477	0.881605420	2609	2576	2928.2747	2302.4033	0.8781091	0.7035439	-0.3198	-0.193713017977	0.8012033!sample_table_end
