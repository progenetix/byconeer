Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481584/suppl/GSM481584_EL646.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2141	1699	2114.3863	1726.8115	1.0384255	0.8331912	-0.3177	0.105966722105	0.80236012	1009	885	986.1457	924.9018	0.6950737	0.6127649	-0.1818	-0.141719019172	0.88158283	3309	2258	3262.2636	2278.6871	1.0397529	0.7409244	-0.4888	-0.329963810064	0.71259664	19274	12960	18376.003	12859.618	8.1171223	5.7163174	-0.5059	-0.376269306524	0.70422965	11566	16989	11201.254	16891.691	3.4538658	5.2871889	0.6143	-0.149017609789	1.53080326	14517	12656	13964.336	12549.751	5.0789847	4.5993169	-0.1431	-0.0338640674644	0.90555837	1845	2335	1821.0643	2352.8383	0.701859	0.851347	0.2786	-0.198581839449	1.21298868	1855	1604	1831.0289	1633.1895	0.9559291	0.8739267	-0.1294	-0.161179962866	0.9142179	2487	2502	2457.5778	2515.9931	1.7988462	1.7653329	-0.0271	0.0796425767009	0.981369610	10289	9667	10000.02	9575.2769	6.6477709	6.2311113	-0.0934	-0.033615723301	0.937323411	4136	2883	4076.3598	2894.5595	2.6786111	1.9285936	-0.4739	-0.331583178807	0.719997612	8906	6440	8687.2072	6396.4919	4.515954	3.2896849	-0.4571	-0.296753195043	0.728458513	1566	1391	1546.747	1424.0504	1.1649222	1.03732	-0.1674	-0.0666083822258	0.890462914	4333	4208	4270.1718	4192.1183	2.0538292	1.9950091	-0.0419	-0.135445317491	0.971360715	1703	1614	1679.9606	1642.972	0.9287805	0.898357	-0.0480	-0.00704519087098	0.967243716	2015	2181	1989.1758	2204.8122	0.8552922	0.9311996	0.1227	-0.12290222225	1.088750217	802	582	775.8123	629.2467	0.5293848	0.4012529	-0.3998	-0.194605374662	0.757960818	6633	6028	6501.3872	5993.8669	1.9697893	1.7764786	-0.1490	-0.0611240303614	0.901862319	1263	1010	1237.3698	1047.7398	1.0114301	0.8210978	-0.3008	-0.119050868586	0.811818620	2668	1905	2634.78	1932.8493	1.7461484	1.3125695	-0.4118	-0.00731684300279	0.7516942!sample_table_end
