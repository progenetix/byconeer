Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481969/suppl/GSM481969_MR453.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4438	2901	3998.4195	3232.9245	1.47207	1.1625342	0.3406	0.194103320177	1.26625952	1346	1401	1223.4877	1573.6749	0.6605876	0.8367543	-0.3411	-0.334594184725	0.78946433	3390	3020	3047.3568	3361.591	0.9035449	0.9676596	-0.0989	-0.26133598046	0.93374244	9925	11236	9137.708	11032.601	2.7208287	3.3104298	-0.2830	-0.411942835147	0.82189595	16344	19875	15302.124	18517.196	4.5142729	5.3307757	-0.2399	-0.33794609841	0.84683226	10468	9513	9657.1528	9552.7755	3.0447851	2.9453414	0.0479	-0.0267540894102	1.0337637	2889	3329	2596.1093	3698.0006	0.6351428	0.9191456	-0.5332	-0.493210632347	0.69101438	3321	2566	2984.989	2869.2633	0.8950066	0.8506446	0.0733	0.057354609233	1.05215119	3823	3436	3442.1064	3812.827	1.8135411	1.9334099	-0.0923	0.0881019663198	0.938001310	12782	10800	11905.458	10657.755	5.1622804	4.5315354	0.1880	0.0669572680075	1.139190111	10248	10008	9446.562	9979.5659	3.2819556	3.438773	-0.0673	-0.119965540554	0.954397212	9965	13922	9175.9307	13354.427	2.5294963	3.6654034	-0.5351	-0.571562216494	0.690100313	2134	1715	1928.6098	1926.3479	0.7340892	0.6972362	0.0743	0.00811006673167	1.052855814	8632	10219	7903.6467	10159.541	2.5588615	3.0470077	-0.2519	-0.242413427049	0.839794815	2484	1827	2238.4856	2052.6714	0.6913793	0.6133803	0.1727	0.181724922699	1.127162416	2454	2263	2212.3896	2537.001	0.5907206	0.6692272	-0.1800	0.0499743251988	0.882690617	753	558	680.3539	636.9981	0.3402548	0.3123055	0.1237	0.114783180778	1.089493518	7748	6720	7054.6993	7077.456	1.6888107	1.6862476	0.0022	-0.010654422213	1.0015219	1472	1058	1336.5735	1192.829	0.633191	0.5504188	0.2021	0.125694871122	1.150380420	2394	1763	2159.7067	1981.1383	0.9036863	0.834714	0.1145	0.109016411353	1.0826298!sample_table_end
