Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481899/suppl/GSM481899_MR313.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	7926	7729	7713.6409	7806.4427	1.7875188	1.7800757	0.0060	0.0513084755524	1.00418132	5111	4751	4982.2391	4870.3033	1.2297145	1.1853674	0.0530	0.0159573658663	1.03741213	8211	6526	8000.3213	6616.5914	1.7746639	1.4578413	0.2837	-0.0184586956319	1.21732314	10335	8247	10109.833	8302.6668	2.0830539	1.7090247	0.2855	-0.0208484805056	1.21885535	14520	14607	14304.573	14391.476	3.368192	3.3485978	0.0084	-0.162249474682	1.00585156	10903	10169	10674.162	10154.679	2.510581	2.3665193	0.0853	0.0006859826477	1.06087497	4077	3618	3990.1496	3731.1652	0.8777046	0.8786079	-0.0015	-0.0246038478871	0.99897188	3727	3929	3657.4036	4044.7994	0.64607	0.7362556	-0.1885	-0.0524056225741	0.87750789	10400	11641	10174.396	11578.663	2.3427608	2.6755964	-0.1917	-0.0442440097898	0.875603210	16903	17707	16745.541	17356.073	2.7802953	3.0962134	-0.1553	-0.166855105905	0.897966311	35285	32769	35377.563	31990.513	6.0733652	5.8582677	0.0520	-0.0384030293811	1.036716912	10937	7743	10707.951	7819.8176	2.1433766	1.6199704	0.4039	-0.000425167163703	1.323096213	12280	13318	12041.408	13171.256	2.2345066	2.6302022	-0.2352	-0.133512863682	0.849556914	10797	12362	10568.816	12266.708	2.8901637	3.2948669	-0.1891	-0.211034513016	0.877171615	8469	8077	8258.9008	8138.6163	1.4978936	1.5627663	-0.0612	-0.0264128363313	0.958488616	5989	7119	5828.8675	7214.5002	1.1909174	1.4724759	-0.3062	-0.13544783717	0.808785717	3919	4051	3841.3097	4162.3521	0.9169833	0.9870028	-0.1062	-0.0143239650501	0.929058518	5895	6607	5737.9247	6698.0917	1.6511142	1.6871396	-0.0311	-0.0138449241417	0.97864719	6587	7586	6407.5855	7669.3731	1.4960176	1.7700265	-0.2426	-0.130846085707	0.84519520	4562	3869	4457.1617	3986.905	0.7118108	0.6750616	0.0765	-0.0403552200643	1.0544384!sample_table_end
