Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481826/suppl/GSM481826_MR096.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4796	4823	4934.3623	4651.5369	1.3573948	1.2123584	-0.1630	-0.0478053118279	0.89315092	3392	3795	3545.435	3647.8138	0.8693701	0.8646447	-0.0079	0.0560196573561	0.99456463	5165	4727	5285.0914	4557.3285	1.3694092	1.1357289	-0.2699	-0.0339179184193	0.82935684	10080	10319	9842.1963	10288.204	2.6440689	2.6925229	0.0262	0.00980893277244	1.01832555	14328	10127	13694.633	10084.21	3.3529383	2.3828825	-0.4927	-0.398389296717	0.71068486	8015	9103	7976.5672	9010.3541	2.2139174	2.3798366	0.1043	0.116736162926	1.07494377	2664	3032	2810.5042	2910.8838	0.6394758	0.7106352	0.1522	0.156290206633	1.11127788	2397	2944	2540.9224	2828.4389	0.6740355	0.7456946	0.1458	-0.0294567940351	1.10631359	6088	6455	6164.1249	6286.211	1.3990664	1.3742151	-0.0259	0.0325229372639	0.982237110	15576	14457	14829.149	14697.76	3.1890709	3.2740496	0.0379	-0.0115397640519	1.026646811	20105	18044	18901.152	18563.61	4.5633035	4.6528286	0.0280	-0.0132354484659	1.019618412	7899	11408	7868.8925	11443.341	1.9017617	2.7485071	0.5313	0.239096761209	1.445242613	8954	8214	8832.5479	8086.4633	1.6919458	1.5772827	-0.1012	-0.0347929161902	0.9322314	12122	11148	11692.624	11164.375	2.4998766	2.3304832	-0.1012	-0.0977161248555	0.932239315	5419	5963	5522.857	5789.1245	1.2879846	1.3355931	0.0524	0.0594559304675	1.036963516	4418	4950	4563.1475	4776.6861	1.0888288	1.1440933	0.0714	-0.00586546928686	1.050755917	2230	2036	2369.8269	1969.6438	0.6013013	0.4838282	-0.3136	-0.0629924769165	0.804635218	6913	7464	6940.9363	7319.6746	1.6541756	1.6382586	-0.0139	-0.101914484028	0.990377619	4721	5037	4861.3565	4863.4572	1.2324702	1.2081438	-0.0288	-0.0155971348084	0.98026220	3857	3717	4006.9052	3573.6307	0.7875467	0.7435558	-0.0829	-0.126514978278	0.9441419!sample_table_end
