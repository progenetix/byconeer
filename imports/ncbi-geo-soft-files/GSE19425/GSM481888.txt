Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481888/suppl/GSM481888_MR302.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5803	5323	5923.3301	5054.0131	1.6731808	1.4434852	-0.2130	0.082617578166	0.86271922	3684	4116	3824.6155	3934.0392	1.176839	1.1297892	-0.0589	-0.0706425423699	0.96002023	4757	3393	4893.7735	3256.4944	1.2832313	0.9793332	-0.3899	0.0667273836979	0.76317744	5971	4429	6090.2717	4229.1538	1.798162	1.324644	-0.4409	-0.200870342328	0.73666565	11982	10017	11875.318	9648.978	3.5135045	3.0120992	-0.2221	-0.177337912162	0.8572926	9073	7350	9091.7076	7005.0682	2.4694883	2.1887516	-0.1741	-0.276403782604	0.88631797	3282	3076	3402.7801	2963.5001	0.9853569	0.8748235	-0.1717	0.0369273762824	0.8878248	2019	2110	2092.2835	2082.2392	0.6829837	0.6732675	-0.0207	0.0577569054385	0.98577399	8531	10306	8578.1983	9936.3088	2.5005352	2.7521875	0.1383	-0.0814459952191	1.100639410	8809	10839	8841.2957	10465.629	2.9740142	3.4502485	0.2143	-0.376617631735	1.160131811	20148	16011	19475.491	15644.55	6.4244106	5.281795	-0.2825	0.00386815735176	0.822144712	5593	4511	5716.3723	4305.0794	1.9537216	1.4340965	-0.4461	-0.0629287136449	0.734033213	5446	7529	5575.561	7180.5846	2.0643507	2.282632	0.1450	-0.169479935562	1.105738514	8747	7942	8782.6545	7597.8696	2.4292931	2.1429105	-0.1810	-0.0982645392442	0.882112815	3682	4014	3822.5917	3838.8121	1.2462973	1.2339285	-0.0144	-0.161512502685	0.990075516	3813	4380	3955.0186	4183.7591	1.1186118	1.257204	0.1685	-0.191587698008	1.123896617	1875	2563	1936.8895	2489.932	0.603558	0.7180956	0.2507	-0.0395978380376	1.189770518	3604	4687	3743.2832	4467.5753	1.2979269	1.2823133	-0.0175	-0.107189481875	0.987970419	3697	4258	3837.7615	4069.0346	1.2154609	1.1944308	-0.0252	-0.166325518837	0.982697920	2050	1782	2125.4846	1777.9924	0.6066285	0.5325065	-0.1880	-0.0117210515783	0.8778132!sample_table_end
