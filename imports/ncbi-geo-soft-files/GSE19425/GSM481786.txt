Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481786/suppl/GSM481786_JBH562.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1423	1375	1441.7941	1337.2499	1.821344	1.771083	-0.0404	0.218069903438	0.97240442	455	543	415.5023	574.5632	0.6676397	0.8664598	0.3761	0.234772543806	1.29779533	835	832	822.0303	837.9352	0.807678	0.882926	0.1285	0.119709818102	1.09316574	3939	3079	4006.3168	2928.7676	3.6280199	2.9362001	-0.3052	0.151712072505	0.8093125	7127	10804	7162.2283	10385.472	8.1665745	12.784867	0.6466	0.382607496545	1.56551166	4354	3837	4422.324	3641.4913	4.6110996	4.1227138	-0.1615	-0.0872712622662	0.89408477	853	926	841.598	921.96	1.0733244	1.147148	0.0960	0.0687642131178	1.06878038	952	898	946.3049	896.7359	0.8201336	0.7996665	-0.0365	0.0291454079074	0.97504429	1093	1211	1094.9736	1185.9778	1.7650271	1.728127	-0.0305	0.0428892946335	0.979093710	4076	4841	4143.9268	4592.1567	3.9208915	4.1996346	0.0991	0.0097721062744	1.071091711	10164	8385	10092.754	8023.1743	9.4688659	7.6580968	-0.3062	-0.0960189166429	0.80876612	1878	1948	1910.74	1869.0516	1.8547461	1.875537	0.0161	0.407779323316	1.011209613	1431	2085	1450.1203	1996.8079	1.667432	2.1170883	0.3445	0.133351116989	1.2696714	1123	1453	1126.5166	1409.062	2.1947871	2.5544365	0.2189	0.220095141797	1.163865215	1286	1451	1297.481	1407.2195	1.2208132	1.3140621	0.1062	0.0251863125938	1.076382516	997	1092	993.8166	1074.9886	0.9177937	1.0229747	0.1565	-0.048306282137	1.11460217	470	418	431.7819	462.4262	0.6081199	0.6628842	0.1244	-0.00818853110156	1.09005518	1388	1551	1405.2226	1499.7019	1.7754653	1.9234346	0.1155	-0.0107928350776	1.083341119	1222	766	1230.4083	778.0767	1.1547098	1.0100471	-0.1931	-0.172416409911	0.874719420	977	867	972.6942	868.8429	0.8997102	0.7654336	-0.2332	0.129017206813	0.8507557!sample_table_end
