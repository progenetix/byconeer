Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481521/suppl/GSM481521_DE486.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4137	3331	4138.5319	3285.7152	1.0063209	0.8142727	0.3055	0.070102958856	1.23585242	6084	6853	5994.793	6829.3855	1.5894886	1.8283524	-0.2020	-0.0509041463602	0.86935563	5622	4779	5551.8222	4756.8885	1.338536	1.1655489	0.1996	0.0635275162325	1.14841684	12302	14687	11654.227	14719.853	2.9406451	3.8245575	-0.3792	-0.181047358138	0.7688855	19724	20566	17580.719	21186.14	4.1868925	5.2084867	-0.3150	-0.190447376482	0.80385966	9604	8343	9313.2335	8333.9067	2.3726579	2.1830916	0.1201	0.0500887332808	1.08683387	4314	4163	4305.1163	4141.813	0.9655659	0.9438558	0.0328	0.0126979560688	1.02300158	2492	2792	2584.547	2738.9618	0.6046849	0.6579538	-0.1218	-0.0912266199566	0.91903859	5507	4675	5439.7952	4654.8563	1.3994543	1.1854654	0.2394	0.135183773439	1.180510410	14837	10660	13762.032	10608.36	3.6386015	2.7841025	0.3862	0.144990275295	1.306920811	25547	18446	21849.969	18807.992	5.5884539	4.7792726	0.2257	0.107407872277	1.169310512	9488	12377	9208.4275	12318.501	2.5264154	3.3246811	-0.3961	-0.118388375737	0.75989713	6540	3995	6440.8161	3969.7295	2.1866553	1.2532215	0.8031	0.309199358908	1.744827414	17585	14693	15949.643	14726.2	3.4186347	3.3003629	0.0508	-0.0151497741763	1.03583615	8018	5754	7832.304	5754.134	1.8055628	1.3329902	0.4378	0.184470101874	1.354520616	5211	4545	5156.9198	4525.077	1.2282499	1.0839285	0.1803	0.0377277245419	1.133146517	2935	1811	3005.2291	1743.1099	0.744336	0.4492779	0.7283	0.326691043348	1.656738218	8061	7388	7873.1561	7367.5076	1.7047038	1.6636784	0.0351	-0.00366171621935	1.024659419	4246	3646	4241.0564	3610.3355	1.2029482	1.0152279	0.2448	-0.00298145036476	1.184904520	1642	1743	1764.9435	1675.7346	0.5111489	0.4815007	0.0862	0.00835106070031	1.0615746!sample_table_end
