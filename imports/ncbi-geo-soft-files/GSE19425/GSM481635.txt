Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9775!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481635/suppl/GSM481635_JA694.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	965	982	988.55854	982.4842	0.5585589	0.5491158	0.0246	-0.057737381645	1.01719692	982	1085	1006.5579	1082.2849	0.7619692	0.7889847	-0.0503	-0.11155548735	0.96575913	2218	2570	2266.8223	2504.8521	1.2696188	1.3793824	-0.1196	-0.188077981979	0.92042554	3840	6231	3917.9656	5976.7657	2.7948045	4.1789725	-0.5804	-0.447247985135	0.66877795	6782	10689	6874.2636	10277.887	4.8268497	7.3175354	-0.6003	-0.515062679853	0.65962776	5139	4881	5253.4229	4711.9321	2.2169108	1.9416178	0.1913	0.17247292207	1.14178537	2160	2140	2206.998	2095.2697	0.8570772	0.7878978	0.1214	0.172164889243	1.08780248	3199	3590	3263.309	3478.0904	0.950879	1.039737	-0.1289	-0.0937630047913	0.91453799	1385	1701	1418.487	1672.5518	0.7924149	0.877723	-0.1475	-0.145300489372	0.902807410	15743	16176	15615.334	15575.059	3.7543236	3.8397246	-0.0324	-0.0475513655823	0.977758511	6157	6005	6253.5812	5766.0049	2.0455095	1.9463112	0.0717	-0.0582831675202	1.050967312	4319	6298	4411.0145	6040.3186	1.8670207	2.6502782	-0.5054	-0.348808999153	0.704462113	2902	2914	2960.7176	2835.8854	1.1561579	1.1069309	0.0628	-0.0965390744423	1.044471614	5062	5971	5175.9531	5734.3306	2.8355216	3.1548129	-0.1539	-0.350701982562	0.898792315	1575	1565	1614.2523	1541.3303	0.4504175	0.4683115	-0.0562	-0.0689642928727	0.961790516	1858	2101	1903.4214	2057.4534	1.5223871	1.6066972	-0.0778	-0.0975384602679	0.947525817	750	579	765.08869	595.353	0.2148178	0.1823964	0.2360	0.000955613174399	1.177752418	1956	1850	2001.4159	1816.9261	1.2518877	1.1326502	0.1444	0.158219900396	1.10527319	1192	1096	1220.534	1092.8236	0.4890497	0.4644461	0.0745	-0.0284039168122	1.05297420	1642	1913	1682.5917	1876.8403	0.9028144	0.9809957	-0.1198	-0.148051374344	0.9203041!sample_table_end
