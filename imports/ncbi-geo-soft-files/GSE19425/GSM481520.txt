Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481520/suppl/GSM481520_DE483.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3126	2613	3064.9638	2667.4948	1.2714964	1.0564998	-0.2672	-0.0563776900895	0.83091052	3187	3582	3124.8664	3628.2459	1.3999067	1.4578255	0.0585	-0.0175239449694	1.04137333	4312	4085	4236.4643	4117.0148	1.4727795	1.4392427	-0.0332	0.126465842189	0.97722894	12736	12801	11929.496	13122.171	3.9011847	4.3932643	0.1714	-0.034440758229	1.12613595	17754	13819	16069.603	14284.275	5.8299445	5.1674482	-0.1740	-0.163663042675	0.88636326	6497	5765	6348.2395	5754.6115	2.4938267	2.2659289	-0.1383	-0.0460335264476	0.90861527	2651	2267	2600.6503	2328.4638	0.9077866	0.8244737	-0.1389	-0.114539696991	0.90822428	2417	1960	2371.3993	2016.7141	0.6350276	0.5781582	-0.1354	-0.239677321034	0.91044589	3400	3231	3336.0194	3282.3328	1.3696667	1.2060138	-0.1836	-0.0246219130469	0.880516210	16907	13573	15379.488	14000.713	4.2330805	3.9873201	-0.0863	0.0873828628096	0.941942811	25984	20555	22555.088	22357.1	6.262744	6.496123	0.0528	0.0332810421717	1.037264612	8219	10541	7952.7926	10640.297	2.6512674	3.5794457	0.4331	0.0196481192373	1.350088513	5942	5780	5821.3956	5769.1236	1.7484831	1.7193324	-0.0243	0.133490928868	0.98332814	7153	7411	6966.8531	7386.0238	3.2183133	3.0315849	-0.0862	-0.00135782527949	0.941979415	5797	5120	5682.629	5126.5621	1.6556693	1.5240415	-0.1195	0.105659038485	0.920498716	3805	3495	3742.9119	3542.9574	1.218836	1.1672147	-0.0624	0.0468849449351	0.95764717	1550	1342	1516.8707	1397.1989	0.6411425	0.5462545	-0.2311	0.152319989885	0.852001618	4242	4342	4168.4379	4369.0728	1.6487856	1.7028512	0.0465	0.0527586500164	1.032791119	3129	2752	3067.9086	2805.7494	1.2974967	1.1201908	-0.2120	-0.00101550968913	0.863347720	1998	1757	1953.6628	1815.0661	0.5285561	0.5121505	-0.0455	-0.0600788988938	0.9689616!sample_table_end
