Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481587/suppl/GSM481587_EL649.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2546	2304	2502.4035	2336.5853	0.7967088	0.7552449	0.0771	-0.193588678183	1.05490122	3176	3124	3148.1108	3125.9334	1.0407945	1.0284617	0.0172	-0.0336606158453	1.01199153	2028	1551	1970.3559	1613.6498	0.8172373	0.6355564	0.3627	0.00641609203212	1.2858614	16190	15686	16141.269	15277.263	7.0108986	6.6224412	0.0822	-0.0473307981733	1.05865775	8725	15559	8778.9867	15152.607	3.6950012	5.8572083	-0.6646	0.0336603681174	0.63084686	12157	11479	12187.009	11139.201	5.4646413	4.7546445	0.2008	0.00740564585374	1.1493277	1226	1426	1151.2763	1492.5436	0.7216648	0.8625152	-0.2572	0.143353187252	0.83669818	1661	1562	1593.3801	1624.2892	0.9621221	0.9739468	-0.0176	-0.010649858579	0.9878599	4026	3816	4018.6193	3782.2462	1.2897731	1.207768	0.0948	-0.0331333199879	1.06789810	9774	9395	9825.0157	9131.1049	6.7148608	6.3876945	0.0721	0.0406526042968	1.051218211	3507	3030	3486.9713	3036.119	2.4392281	2.1530126	0.1801	-0.244515008134	1.132937212	4987	4743	5001.6341	4657.8004	4.3948062	3.9113118	0.1681	0.0188537660889	1.123614413	1283	1009	1208.8324	1090.1	1.1704082	1.0515741	0.1545	0.0507160745339	1.11300614	6400	6695	6438.2675	6538.5641	1.847877	1.7800604	0.0539	0.0708271537443	1.038097915	1266	1000	1191.7573	1081.2723	1.1267233	1.0003122	0.1717	-0.0986853369642	1.126371616	1373	1354	1299.23	1423.3261	0.9772233	1.0091627	-0.0464	0.00466361214929	0.968350617	854	579	772.7995	665.2704	0.2543509	0.2217495	0.1979	-0.085440344175	1.14701918	5308	5682	5331.3251	5569.9116	1.7530747	1.7008449	0.0436	-0.121605203989	1.030708219	2500	2024	2455.3464	2070.0525	0.8544517	0.7593102	0.1703	0.0666626403434	1.125320	2053	1666	1995.9026	1725.8114	1.5135673	1.3783081	0.1351	-0.0588229386191	1.0981342!sample_table_end
