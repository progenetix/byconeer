Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481892/suppl/GSM481892_MR306.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5949	3252	5491.3976	3538.1459	1.2809205	0.8227804	-0.6386	-0.0545167514877	0.64233522	7033	5747	6513.7436	6051.6371	1.8017197	1.699508	-0.0843	0.0141055851372	0.94326993	4478	2670	4110.4395	2940.3104	1.0180703	0.7098665	-0.5202	0.00558941212475	0.69726684	20164	15570	18457.674	16031.947	4.1370994	3.6125016	-0.1956	-0.113717026687	0.87319675	17712	15453	16234.112	15912.921	4.401386	4.0510554	-0.1197	-0.205225778399	0.92040456	10827	13114	10022.571	13533.704	2.6257041	3.4438719	0.3913	0.184255789028	1.31159947	2541	3724	2324.7406	4020.4401	0.7721436	1.1878019	0.6214	0.182559334648	1.53831738	4755	3630	4370.8357	3923.1628	0.9337551	0.8819558	-0.0823	-0.0411318370603	0.94452599	5180	3827	4781.5857	4125.3981	1.2427964	1.1021614	-0.1733	-0.112773702244	0.886839810	15194	11109	13953.02	11490.562	3.333702	2.9861055	-0.1589	-0.153567887296	0.895732611	17841	13133	16351.86	13553.065	3.6679146	3.3000296	-0.1525	-0.171525514909	0.899701912	12450	10608	11470.055	10980.842	2.9451606	2.8418169	-0.0515	-0.114847346846	0.964910713	5339	3484	4927.3698	3770.7932	1.3755419	1.0861423	-0.3408	-0.151051164721	0.789610514	10931	11294	10115.244	11677.591	3.7029715	3.5525434	-0.0598	-0.287374269911	0.959376415	4395	3043	4034.0053	3326.9264	0.8949995	0.7509003	-0.2533	-0.01846614814	0.838995216	3195	2587	2915.5916	2854.7238	0.7789595	0.7405772	-0.0729	-0.142206643047	0.950726117	1888	1127	1746.9392	1291.4567	0.4709935	0.351777	-0.4210	0.103989834503	0.746882918	5854	6359	5401.005	6683.8939	1.6655053	1.6923935	0.0231	0.161319906437	1.016144219	3201	2002	2921.2178	2246.4626	0.786759	0.6169871	-0.3507	-0.11417658432	0.784213520	4551	2632	4177.8661	2900.8394	0.8747619	0.6888823	-0.3446	-0.097280947977	0.7875084!sample_table_end
