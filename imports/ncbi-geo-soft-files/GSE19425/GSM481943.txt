Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481943/suppl/GSM481943_MR369.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3583	3203	3418.4349	3315.799	1.2000474	1.1867366	0.0161	0.0563443540948	1.01121632	5213	3367	4584.7133	3501.2867	1.673778	1.2927186	0.3727	0.175812760026	1.29477363	4387	2770	4013.3569	2825.4207	1.4437135	1.0644607	0.4397	0.0595161526808	1.35628634	13924	7434	10838.441	7999.3447	4.2419874	3.1905933	0.4109	0.0418458719255	1.32952935	13695	8095	10649.281	8655.9636	4.0496462	3.3831763	0.2594	-0.0367494000949	1.19699536	7369	4403	6065.8048	4722.5446	2.2682914	1.8362454	0.3048	0.110482182282	1.23528777	1886	1233	1998.6512	1152.3671	0.8381894	0.4776299	0.8114	0.381829665578	1.75489298	1522	1957	1653.427	1903.9025	0.648614	0.7874564	-0.2798	-0.0980674276186	0.82368259	2848	3633	2847.2644	3802.0355	0.9591165	1.2963268	-0.4347	-0.165744289885	0.739872510	9676	7269	7617.3787	7832.7522	3.1223915	3.3396946	-0.0971	-0.137754109901	0.934933211	18985	18463	15497.894	18115.072	6.3561857	7.6219634	-0.2620	-0.195414741469	0.833930212	10383	6333	8110.9622	6871.3142	3.4783134	2.8526986	0.2861	-0.0593538468965	1.219306313	3168	3777	3101.9503	3969.3018	1.3846876	1.817542	-0.3924	-0.212118180054	0.761846314	11958	8887	9271.9715	9413.53	3.4385642	3.557146	-0.0489	-0.14095696739	0.966663815	3651	4175	3471.0689	4452.5988	1.3266854	1.7198669	-0.3745	-0.18306473439	0.771388416	2059	3231	2156.9248	3347.4094	0.8948198	1.3416105	-0.5843	-0.274510878053	0.666974417	962	992	1102.9939	917.1622	0.3905147	0.3417162	0.1926	0.135044519659	1.142804318	4985	4370	4425.83	4685.2215	1.5275852	1.6183039	-0.0832	-0.0398900170167	0.943942119	2379	2870	2438.3015	2938.8456	0.8804875	1.1335434	-0.3645	-0.191756816182	0.776756720	1244	1647	1388.8625	1570.5414	0.5575945	0.6754977	-0.2767	-0.216959790368	0.8254574!sample_table_end
