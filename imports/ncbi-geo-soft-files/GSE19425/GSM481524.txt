Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481524/suppl/GSM481524_DE487.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4650	3646	4318.6658	3914.7648	1.0834198	0.9465856	-0.1948	0.0904826169481	0.87370152	7109	6192	6606.2006	6598.0721	1.8863565	1.7992139	-0.0682	-0.114504320292	0.95380373	5460	5075	5065.0096	5428.8755	1.1143781	1.1696526	0.0698	0.160688796441	1.04960124	19341	14269	17167.583	15320.903	4.0022963	3.565455	-0.1667	-0.216430599813	0.89085235	24859	19054	21668.604	20825.242	4.7318544	4.4231308	-0.0973	-0.183470642178	0.93475636	11301	9128	10370.794	9715.8586	2.4381446	2.1949349	-0.1516	-0.0842907447133	0.9002487	4583	4201	4255.435	4499.5886	0.8909285	0.9410096	0.0789	0.0425046833721	1.05621228	3000	2583	2787.496	2802.4227	0.6230781	0.6341664	0.0254	-0.0569309907914	1.0177969	5002	4277	4646.8637	4578.2731	1.2151714	1.1541104	-0.0744	0.0265279927423	0.94975110	12107	11900	11070.111	12692.538	3.2684831	3.4401413	0.0738	0.207665749821	1.052519211	23934	14262	20918.716	15313.102	5.3189459	3.8392386	-0.4703	-0.297048132523	0.721804412	15799	15673	14240.504	16917.131	3.2875425	3.9882016	0.2787	0.0479068675768	1.213125513	6822	5642	6342.3394	6023.3491	1.6690315	1.520424	-0.1345	0.189096466367	0.910961714	14233	12331	12919.568	13171.72	3.2102765	3.0857139	-0.0571	-0.0479067089607	0.961198815	6798	5344	6319.9812	5712.9933	1.3576145	1.2400827	-0.1306	0.0744898173584	0.913427716	5414	4982	5023.0491	5328.2195	1.0810804	1.1415443	0.0785	0.125984694583	1.055929117	2308	2013	2141.7362	2199.9709	0.5838163	0.5676039	-0.0406	0.221960454999	0.972230318	8929	7618	8262.9423	8100.4415	1.824408	1.7815853	-0.0343	-0.00688355196929	0.976527819	5253	4112	4876.2242	4407.6043	1.3416362	1.2025783	-0.1579	-0.0242126921336	0.89635220	2230	1835	2068.8851	2009.5147	0.5406069	0.5359005	-0.0126	0.0374973518538	0.9912942!sample_table_end
