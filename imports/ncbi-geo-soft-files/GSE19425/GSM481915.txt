Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481915/suppl/GSM481915_MR329.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5643	5416	5448.2319	5567.0121	1.2222084	1.2870194	-0.0745	0.0110266867407	0.94964252	6235	5142	5968.0683	5277.0784	1.4741092	1.3259557	0.1528	0.0658682646331	1.11173343	4494	3418	4393.6626	3444.1784	1.0325474	0.7953981	0.3765	0.0279146991454	1.29815174	17757	15247	16318.973	15812.985	3.7071136	3.6497076	0.0225	-0.152354224025	1.01572895	19663	16990	18105.366	17591.033	4.7513866	4.4074853	0.1084	-0.112261678429	1.07802666	12682	10116	11745.902	10555.53	2.9490291	2.6128679	0.1746	0.0453616071768	1.1286567	3051	2767	3050.2498	2773.7848	0.7938586	0.6913026	0.1996	0.075920583532	1.14835188	3917	4046	3870.6105	4109.248	0.8148644	0.9117576	-0.1621	-0.0391927381869	0.89372919	5050	6004	4905.8434	6194.8344	1.1553305	1.4706257	-0.3481	-0.122480820181	0.785604710	12568	11172	11646.006	11659.964	2.7877929	3.0170475	-0.1140	-0.146228736289	0.924013511	19833	17636	18266.52	18227.002	4.0112086	4.3178703	-0.1063	-0.117555479135	0.928978412	14602	10515	13456.023	10975.293	3.0813136	2.6089865	0.2401	-0.0823561429748	1.181038513	4397	4761	4306.1018	4872.3102	1.3623351	1.5412367	-0.1780	-0.104907515522	0.883923314	10638	11837	9930.407	12344.032	3.1407648	3.5900043	-0.1929	-0.212934859299	0.874863715	4872	4449	4739.1295	4537.9553	1.0025293	1.0113113	-0.0126	-0.00212080494016	0.991316216	3468	4142	3449.9641	4210.497	0.7869995	0.9635722	-0.2920	-0.128377565922	0.816751917	1704	1635	1761.4527	1637.8954	0.4240799	0.409155	0.0517	0.0645998018102	1.036477518	5268	6739	5109.396	6972.5029	1.4265241	1.7525052	-0.2969	-0.146732484937	0.813991319	3135	3104	3130.6083	3122.7542	0.7559898	0.7899231	-0.0633	-0.0411968560703	0.957042220	3320	2982	3308.8305	2996.2119	0.727227	0.724473	0.0055	-0.0758556214939	1.0038014!sample_table_end
