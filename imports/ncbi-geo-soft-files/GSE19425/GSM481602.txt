Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481602/suppl/GSM481602_EL666.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2745	2213	2735.5317	2226.6933	1.0853209	0.8798605	-0.3028	-0.0477221890928	0.81069152	2104	2332	2089.6473	2343.3526	0.9010636	0.9874762	0.1321	0.201755167905	1.09590073	3610	2704	3611.6062	2701.7068	1.3145368	0.9955925	-0.4009	-0.0114401928625	0.75737134	7361	7690	7383.9884	7474.9483	2.8000124	3.0782673	0.1367	-0.0170665120112	1.09937635	10110	15342	10126.817	14979.602	3.6790155	5.3778413	0.5477	0.0843486926581	1.4617616	8531	7821	8553.6094	7600.609	3.324011	3.0573651	-0.1206	-0.0819165800903	0.91978187	2470	3355	2456.5163	3323.3082	0.821999	1.0607771	0.3679	0.0680272836371	1.29048458	2635	2484	2623.8385	2491.1148	0.8588001	0.8630983	0.0072	-0.0146564968175	1.00500499	2771	2904	2761.9447	2890.2991	1.1032225	1.1251487	0.0284	-0.0418029058897	1.019874710	11813	13093	11806.412	12754.348	3.9245657	4.2282623	0.1075	0.034125684977	1.077383411	13467	13935	13414.791	13585.793	4.8587627	4.5827403	-0.0844	-0.0185953749069	0.943190812	4748	4532	4766.3247	4456.0312	1.5548319	1.4538252	-0.0969	-0.0337921117833	0.935036913	1938	2369	1927.8632	2379.6626	0.7125643	0.8009634	0.1687	0.0702359818691	1.124057614	6358	7008	6370.8131	6825.3877	2.7809043	2.8766014	0.0488	0.14133848294	1.034412215	2422	2534	2409.119	2538.8163	0.8298587	0.8444863	0.0252	0.0889514773805	1.017626616	2157	2680	2142.7434	2678.6745	0.7142035	0.8419871	0.2375	0.0557208440403	1.178917617	821	731	828.9339	759.0203	0.3621791	0.3235903	-0.1625	-0.00459742490989	0.893453918	5266	4380	5287.5012	4309.3226	1.9275052	1.6237182	-0.2474	-0.0635105091172	0.842393619	2142	1859	2127.7144	1880.3338	0.8445232	0.7650247	-0.1426	0.0634783679612	0.905865820	2838	2061	2827.6298	2078.1485	0.9036884	0.7034652	-0.3613	-0.124411674802	0.7784378!sample_table_end
