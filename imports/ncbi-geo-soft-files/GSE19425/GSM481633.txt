Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9775!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481633/suppl/GSM481633_JA690.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	746	1201	899.3532	1124.9926	0.4480282	0.6106446	-0.4467	-0.024425893939	0.73369712	419	1022	525.5144	966.38872	0.5175914	0.7911406	-0.6121	-0.308316481443	0.65423443	1864	2374	2040.5138	2129.4409	1.1919224	1.2768943	-0.0993	0.00228428520023	0.93345424	4646	7613	4816.9837	6497.2468	2.7686789	3.7942734	-0.4546	-0.4502947759	0.72969935	5624	9860	5740.9844	8386.0719	5.3891159	6.5531241	-0.2821	-0.393680223734	0.82237356	3242	6179	3418.7316	5291.1835	2.3579711	2.2988817	0.0366	0.278931439496	1.02570357	2094	1852	2262.2008	1680.9982	1.5103582	0.711795	1.0854	0.766711505464	2.12190058	1365	2690	1529.9826	2379.2575	0.7826634	0.9478659	-0.2763	-0.0548471695178	0.82571119	1993	2152	2165.8666	1942.7492	1.5020945	0.9913823	0.5995	0.296431445969	1.515151510	8248	11039	8213.5324	9385.6694	3.6129193	4.1651851	-0.2052	-0.116534096035	0.86740911	3808	6064	3984.0506	5194.8041	1.7956916	2.0568378	-0.1959	-0.153697090223	0.87303512	3694	5788	3872.2904	4964.9833	1.8142422	2.7974116	-0.6247	-0.351941827208	0.648543213	1703	2578	1872.0289	2288.2591	0.9562206	1.0018969	-0.0673	0.038703483928	0.954410214	6074	5548	6163.2961	4761.0911	3.2364214	2.8369161	0.1901	-0.314579988105	1.140823715	1044	1313	1204.3372	1220.9076	0.4605702	0.5703076	-0.3083	-0.0240336862264	0.807582216	1483	1829	1648.2427	1660.42	1.4828284	1.5063989	-0.0228	-0.164253618524	0.98435317	444	618	558.8462	596.07248	0.2089803	0.2286426	-0.1297	-0.143261220375	0.914004318	970	1792	1132.906	1626.6377	0.8196408	1.1306125	-0.4640	-0.0701662143228	0.724952819	1002	1249	1164.0171	1166.4562	0.4453571	0.5467886	-0.2960	-0.109577978297	0.814495920	1490	1895	1655.1238	1719.4593	0.9585062	0.9781911	-0.0293	-0.12445676277	0.9798762!sample_table_end
