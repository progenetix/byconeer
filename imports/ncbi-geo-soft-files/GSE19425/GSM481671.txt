Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481671/suppl/GSM481671_JA923.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4415	4104	4368.9478	3963.6579	1.489863	1.3644087	0.1269	-0.0922366647978	1.09194782	2105	2623	2104.3482	2567.4683	0.7056384	0.8532947	-0.2741	-0.243882469728	0.82695753	2738	2723	2725.3126	2659.9805	1.1548123	1.1347179	0.0253	-0.109458036169	1.01770884	4576	5142	4524.6196	4945.1267	1.7873774	2.0328138	-0.1856	-0.284552708569	0.87926275	5358	6428	5294.9745	6183.5489	2.9950069	3.4690386	-0.2120	-0.306469758396	0.86335366	9353	5926	9240.5194	5698.5517	3.9113977	2.4554331	0.6717	0.566628334213	1.59295637	1587	808	1596.6962	832.1541	1.4180132	0.7685884	0.8836	0.940536484167	1.84495778	2635	1704	2623.6283	1701.0348	1.1248058	0.7285443	0.6266	0.713208119091	1.54390859	5072	5200	5011.7374	5000.5371	1.5847247	1.5628808	0.0200	0.1909547463	1.013976710	3793	4459	3769.3982	4299.7166	1.8938408	2.1771223	-0.2011	-0.0198691034687	0.869882611	14911	13554	14705.331	13200.178	7.0234734	6.4543806	0.1219	-0.0960456702668	1.088171612	1650	2570	1659.4679	2518.4465	1.1314195	1.7319446	-0.6143	-0.598196420397	0.653265413	1883	2353	1886.2914	2317.4094	1.5885881	1.8998325	-0.2581	-0.109595878639	0.836172814	8239	9547	8142.8009	9212.6086	2.6495953	2.8524944	-0.1065	-0.184839848369	0.928869615	3172	3120	3159.0731	3043.2241	1.7089743	1.6692603	0.0339	0.0899180170431	1.023791416	1258	1479	1277.1036	1486.5057	0.9028518	1.0792709	-0.2575	-0.137255326534	0.836538617	2714	2670	2701.623	2610.946	0.8752836	0.8527991	0.0375	-0.00618613194653	1.026365418	3381	3630	3360.0333	3512.8088	1.4196523	1.4478331	-0.0284	-0.00948015505241	0.980535919	4608	5112	4555.5426	4916.4659	1.5458627	1.6338617	-0.0799	-0.0554072443901	0.946140520	793	973	811.9332	997.5978	0.3669314	0.4517162	-0.2999	-0.388577599667	0.8123052!sample_table_end
