Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481570/suppl/GSM481570_EL632.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2025	1896	1996.3966	1898.1409	0.7702504	0.6488712	-0.2474	0.0386970231855	0.84241592	2534	2748	2534.4667	2675.4283	1.2052809	1.1949867	-0.0124	-0.1200132335	0.9914593	2289	2439	2264.8409	2392.8788	0.8312126	0.8055403	-0.0453	-0.0182203964098	0.96911464	12871	13564	13324.875	12560.419	5.7146958	4.868209	-0.2313	-0.140160626103	0.85187545	10248	15555	10739.726	14505.248	4.3385831	5.5195769	0.3473	-0.189875751568	1.27220726	7962	7815	8425.3036	7167.5785	3.455291	2.6690147	-0.3725	-0.182453884739	0.77244287	1472	2019	1446.8298	2006.6909	0.6861764	0.9094958	0.4065	0.0317617523488	1.32545478	1787	1692	1755.2373	1711.4912	0.7419825	0.7135122	-0.0564	-0.0230492573686	0.96162949	2057	1915	2029.2089	1914.9896	0.9465758	0.8610665	-0.1366	0.0922182650361	0.909664610	7466	8148	7914.7572	7469.0124	3.4387702	3.8434482	0.1605	0.0712706140347	1.11768111	5922	5123	6285.8393	4744.6375	2.8119504	2.316084	-0.2799	0.020593228147	0.823657512	5968	6329	6335.8225	5817.7105	3.0593518	2.7285408	-0.1651	-0.000359578838322	0.891868913	1561	1063	1535.2641	1139.5978	0.7626644	0.64491	-0.2420	0.0754651326816	0.845601214	5676	6232	6018.6578	5731.1378	2.6871734	2.3186333	-0.2128	-0.0956878141514	0.862852115	1888	1746	1856.0025	1761.6408	0.7812002	0.7459788	-0.0666	0.0663831085539	0.954913716	1800	2003	1767.9649	1992.6191	0.8104935	0.8931723	0.1401	-0.0536284100416	1.102010517	1431	1204	1405.854	1267.8891	0.642801	0.5291611	-0.2807	0.104647309066	0.823211318	3907	4258	4054.4583	3999.3653	1.567417	1.3893152	-0.1740	-0.0725197394545	0.886372419	1353	1176	1327.9352	1242.3602	0.6499726	0.5748628	-0.1772	0.0434934566756	0.884441620	3212	1703	3276.4594	1721.7164	1.2148315	0.8686062	-0.4840	-0.282658425215	0.7150014!sample_table_end
