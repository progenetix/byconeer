Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481847/suppl/GSM481847_MR233.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5998	5606	5733.8275	5834.3344	1.3367783	1.3542994	-0.0188	-0.0379188451815	0.98706262	5073	5060	4854.0601	5272.3096	1.0641754	1.1741759	-0.1419	0.0132974526343	0.90631683	6396	5409	6118.6523	5631.2539	1.4659159	1.3187791	0.1526	-0.141951333118	1.11157054	10326	9635	9884.7043	9945.0021	2.5287595	2.5564686	-0.0157	-0.0727846439123	0.98916115	15463	14761	14758.015	15244.865	3.3936146	3.43165	-0.0161	0.0227873676376	0.98891636	10409	8294	9963.6182	8572.8742	2.5133564	2.1390069	0.2327	0.134849673178	1.17501087	5066	4375	4847.4495	4567.253	0.922617	0.7610764	0.2777	0.0274797891428	1.21225288	2998	2781	2875.2635	2909.5585	0.6519837	0.6733444	-0.0465	0.04878720666	0.96827669	9719	7973	9306.5834	8253.7356	1.9057908	1.7217759	0.1465	-0.00215459961509	1.10687510	16726	15368	15933.193	15881.932	3.5636736	3.6613655	-0.0390	-0.0427157052578	0.973318211	21166	19387	20063.073	20116.047	4.4125145	4.5624921	-0.0482	-0.0322783891135	0.967128112	11604	13904	11101.458	14350.346	2.1960387	2.8508909	-0.3765	-0.278330335611	0.770299113	10824	10279	10361.916	10617.996	2.0526983	2.0529056	-0.0001	-0.0671716973328	0.99989914	13321	12660	12731.732	13065.092	2.6493848	2.7787055	-0.0688	-0.0658224177556	0.953460115	6657	6146	6369.5495	6388.128	1.2172217	1.2266802	-0.0112	-0.0663782354102	0.992289316	6605	7443	6319.5774	7716.6649	1.2241517	1.4000327	-0.1937	-0.0252688564843	0.874373617	3536	2674	3392.6412	2800.5031	0.7412966	0.6240572	0.2484	-0.160645310618	1.187866418	7116	7000	6810.1732	7263.9801	1.4252529	1.5347147	-0.1068	-0.0347458602748	0.928676119	5453	4475	5211.9142	4671.2837	1.2008117	1.1018079	0.1241	-0.0498201387819	1.089855720	2931	2397	2812.4025	2518.8477	0.7799789	0.7249778	0.1055	-0.0453209310784	1.0758658!sample_table_end
