Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481535/suppl/GSM481535_EL155.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3341	2607	3351.4821	2577.2934	1.1418106	0.8829344	0.3709	0.033547891673	1.29319982	2201	2278	2228.0825	2256.8331	0.7312233	0.7699009	-0.0744	-0.240397643411	0.94976283	3763	2902	3761.7025	2859.7525	1.2625692	1.0049542	0.3292	0.0976690425775	1.25634494	9285	10495	9090.9446	9963.6752	3.61383	4.0095719	-0.1499	-0.0546071140726	0.90130075	11743	15358	11399.935	14561.507	3.9647142	5.5056944	-0.4737	-0.122910737009	0.72011156	7756	6661	7657.1099	6403.6697	2.7841681	2.494583	0.1584	0.0759650668149	1.11608557	1653	1974	1691.747	1962.983	0.6393389	0.7784208	-0.2840	-0.119552910325	0.82132818	1983	2301	2012.1409	2279.6913	0.8841842	0.9530235	-0.1082	-0.105487540355	0.92776749	5640	4629	5600.8753	4491.2244	1.72257	1.4241746	0.2744	0.112680652065	1.209521610	4985	5231	4968.5785	5063.4738	2.4665386	2.4308893	0.0210	0.106387451994	1.014665111	8718	9548	8555.8856	9082.8333	4.1373856	4.2469343	-0.0377	-0.181337050729	0.974205212	3108	3291	3120.5036	3238.828	1.3760355	1.4005307	-0.0255	-0.156790564552	0.9825113	2680	2371	2695.6407	2349.2655	1.2632542	1.0681046	0.2421	0.16819375497	1.182706414	8362	7424	8223.604	7108.9587	3.1312614	2.674823	0.2273	-0.0100833824701	1.170642415	2264	2140	2289.1114	2121.7682	0.9832845	0.8663299	0.1827	0.0632092653025	1.135000116	2262	3290	2287.1759	3237.8582	0.9307259	1.3206645	-0.5048	-0.110366099438	0.704740617	1511	1267	1558.514	1258.6434	0.5319238	0.4427753	0.2646	0.123422129279	1.201340318	3060	2781	3072.8513	2743.2202	1.2575348	1.1246856	0.1611	-0.0122164251857	1.118121219	2913	2350	2927.1634	2328.3928	1.0263667	0.8289929	0.3081	0.0556074369992	1.238088720	1931	1917	1960.5733	1906.7753	0.8942117	0.7997951	0.1610	-0.0245429768613	1.1180509!sample_table_end
