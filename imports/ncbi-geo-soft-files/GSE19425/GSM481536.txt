Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481536/suppl/GSM481536_EL156.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2704	2243	2689.2996	2247.862	0.9795819	0.7935476	-0.3038	0.033547891673	0.8100882	2609	2010	2599.3857	2014.3316	0.9554695	0.7208881	-0.4064	-0.240397643411	0.75448573	3399	3123	3359.1009	3126.3568	1.1813958	1.0766862	-0.1339	0.0976690425775	0.91136784	10497	10094	9815.201	10221.292	3.5815597	3.6840516	0.0407	-0.0546071140726	1.02861655	12740	14251	11773.782	14364.71	4.2851437	5.0184083	0.2279	-0.122910737009	1.17111786	7094	6718	6755.3912	6802.1699	2.6005633	2.5888413	-0.0065	0.0759650668149	0.99549257	1865	1917	1886.8806	1920.9131	0.6605209	0.6813838	0.0449	-0.119552910325	1.03158568	2672	2507	2658.644	2510.0579	0.9444326	0.879472	-0.1028	-0.105487540355	0.93121739	4512	4276	4397.0705	4306.1264	1.4728162	1.4235588	-0.0491	0.112680652065	0.966555610	8883	9449	8377.7426	9568.2481	3.107969	3.5498139	0.1918	0.106387451994	1.142165111	14415	10304	13238.755	10435.142	4.8520709	3.8734763	-0.3250	-0.181337050729	0.79831412	4772	3736	4641.1726	3761.7634	1.6747894	1.371595	-0.2881	-0.156790564552	0.818965613	3242	3363	3209.0416	3373.4607	1.1050361	1.1796747	0.0943	0.16819375497	1.06754414	8618	6790	8140.0911	6876.3815	2.9198167	2.4595777	-0.2475	-0.0100833824701	0.842373915	2708	2543	2693.1302	2546.9415	0.9394499	0.9035111	-0.0563	0.0632092653025	0.961744816	3195	3770	3164.0148	3795.6991	1.0769341	1.3113326	0.2841	-0.110366099438	1.217653417	1330	1383	1371.8488	1382.0923	0.5223977	0.5159917	-0.0178	0.123422129279	0.987737418	4227	3708	4131.4574	3733.5679	1.4376143	1.2641497	-0.1855	-0.0122164251857	0.879338519	2288	2042	2293.9991	2046.3942	0.8908731	0.7772185	-0.1969	0.0556074369992	0.872423320	3297	2781	3261.6383	2786.0144	1.1451318	0.9899597	-0.2101	-0.0245429768613	0.8644941!sample_table_end
