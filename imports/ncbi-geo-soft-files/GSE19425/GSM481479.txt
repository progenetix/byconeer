Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481479/suppl/GSM481479_DE388.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1237	2042	1453.4923	1754.4691	1.1047671	1.1151291	-0.0135	-0.0215279705687	0.99070782	847	1612	1017.4338	1379.2758	1.0316506	1.1110541	-0.1070	0.0903124199823	0.92853313	1715	2072	1972.4399	1780.4298	1.4112843	1.2094804	0.2226	0.0861932542854	1.16685174	3704	4589	3966.1725	4062.6871	2.3184125	2.4853032	-0.1003	-0.103009033122	0.93284895	5671	8537	5840.0849	7896.9261	5.1627061	6.5753008	-0.3489	-0.214944690463	0.78516656	3115	4532	3391.4766	4007.704	2.6218558	2.8472237	-0.1190	-0.0761659292713	0.92084647	1201	1595	1413.5425	1364.2361	0.9965457	0.8577562	0.2164	0.264212486326	1.16180538	906	1275	1084.2917	1087.9808	0.516458	0.5997911	-0.2158	-0.129898680894	0.86106329	1026	1653	1223.252	1415.5708	1.1817763	1.0775316	0.1332	0.143252342475	1.09674410	9106	7785	9033.1197	7141.8412	3.4606796	3.6896252	-0.0924	-0.0187487727366	0.937948811	21748	17258	19804.875	17095.859	8.4039799	9.37381	-0.1576	-0.0719078989994	0.896538312	3623	4261	3888.2062	3750.4655	1.8222192	1.9235202	-0.0781	0.0663201409874	0.947335613	6137	5774	6281.0214	5187.7097	2.0598594	2.2186062	-0.1071	-0.0268746685337	0.928447514	2047	4047	2317.5431	3551.7635	2.8089028	3.4840633	-0.3108	-0.0982423002953	0.806214615	4843	4177	5044.7434	3672.3381	2.0430264	1.7403932	0.2313	0.237032919378	1.173887816	2167	2708	2439.3982	2335.6875	1.2465152	1.2222776	0.0283	0.0509918344656	1.019829817	741	1167	895.4689	996.3186	0.7976706	0.7343179	0.1194	0.00163941243204	1.086274218	1608	1912	1858.2598	1640.3903	1.608226	1.400004	0.2000	0.0829714858947	1.148729519	1065	1897	1266.1799	1627.1303	1.0824456	1.1216858	-0.0514	0.0599471872689	0.965016820	1787	1428	2048.4034	1218.8235	0.6923848	0.5295378	0.3868	0.0254533876955	1.3075267!sample_table_end
