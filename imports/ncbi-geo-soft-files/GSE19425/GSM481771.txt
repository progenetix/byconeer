Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481771/suppl/GSM481771_JBH545.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1843	1667	1853.9389	1652.597	1.0749195	1.0149743	0.0828	0.0344002670591	1.05906082	2060	2007	2072.2203	1987.2797	1.4600015	1.4271741	0.0328	0.0306683014365	1.02300163	1531	1355	1545.6676	1343.2623	0.7050119	0.6639168	0.0866	0.0943031012384	1.06189784	6659	5011	6557.523	4954.1614	3.0545794	2.4949199	0.2920	-0.070717541556	1.22431965	13076	11262	12775.725	11066.585	5.8089636	5.7007999	0.0271	-0.109442581077	1.01897346	6146	5110	6059.7974	5052.3602	2.9442001	2.7416917	0.1028	0.0775377982429	1.07386257	1634	1526	1648.2828	1510.4339	1.1118581	0.9935044	0.1624	0.0550416567259	1.11912758	2180	1927	2186.6437	1907.8148	0.9122824	0.8328311	0.1315	0.0583785665127	1.09539919	2120	2309	2130.4738	2287.1366	1.4432233	1.5555658	-0.1081	-0.0590830401751	0.927780310	7007	7516	6896.0306	7403.7462	3.1444539	3.3300234	-0.0827	0.0418863732683	0.944273811	11612	11090	11364.407	10897.57	4.9301156	4.8427739	0.0258	0.0591569972642	1.018035412	4001	3477	3966.5772	3436.9728	2.1649696	1.8526961	0.2247	-0.028343620903	1.168550813	2429	3099	2432.7051	3066.7238	1.2395893	1.3861262	-0.1612	-0.0269288471746	0.894283114	3918	3680	3886.0339	3636.8234	2.9995369	2.8038553	0.0973	-0.10710342575	1.069790215	1665	1736	1679.0116	1720.9095	0.7852111	0.7831533	0.0038	0.0976436950915	1.002627516	1436	1835	1452.1699	1817.8403	0.7996669	0.9897239	-0.3076	0.0949338005994	0.807969617	457	568	469.7314	575.70402	0.3241026	0.4112126	-0.3434	-0.128993325817	0.788163318	2716	2786	2714.175	2759.3567	1.4190701	1.4621655	-0.0432	0.121387866686	0.970526319	1049	1070	1067.9192	1065.7363	0.7072967	0.7169009	-0.0195	0.0928874827929	0.98660320	2006	1656	2018.9916	1641.3424	0.8938778	0.6957027	0.3616	0.109935115718	1.2848561!sample_table_end
