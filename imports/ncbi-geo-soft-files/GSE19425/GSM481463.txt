Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481463/suppl/GSM481463_DE360.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	8623	6024	7994.2884	6309.3642	2.1144422	1.669295	0.3410	-0.0369798266948	1.26666782	3503	3187	3448.3852	3210.8569	0.9123708	0.8481139	0.1054	0.113479277854	1.07576453	6475	4520	6102.2308	4654.0218	1.5982527	1.2147566	0.3958	-0.0289380679176	1.31569794	8491	7700	7879.9316	8191.8088	2.2030133	2.2923108	-0.0573	0.196954835189	0.96104485	20746	18757	18354.355	21048.309	4.8791584	5.5153477	-0.1768	0.216483175526	0.88465116	11090	10873	10131.453	11811.683	2.7138888	3.1901401	-0.2333	-0.117691389482	0.85071157	3169	3145	3145.3319	3165.9858	0.8817036	0.8819842	-0.0005	0.0945530900532	0.99968198	2386	2595	2419.2931	2585.6872	0.6387734	0.6980932	-0.1281	0.0256641493267	0.9150269	7138	6316	6682.5809	6634.9666	1.6469261	1.6371919	0.0086	-0.015323890043	1.005945710	15106	11212	13587.231	12202.035	3.9344079	3.6035317	0.1267	-0.022106254714	1.0918211	39848	27011	34295.617	30814.071	10.059044	9.3181343	0.1104	0.0287144044734	1.079512712	3857	3448	3772.4262	3492.0463	1.138188	1.0573557	0.1063	0.214990411387	1.076447613	8835	7414	8177.7119	7869.613	2.871215	2.7286385	0.0735	-0.139187385278	1.052251914	15234	12340	13695.534	13506.614	3.3996709	3.3157031	0.0361	0.102063195119	1.025324315	7482	5529	6989.7264	5758.9541	2.0025512	1.6526006	0.2771	-0.0553126042606	1.211757516	5024	4408	4826.2814	4531.2393	1.3275847	1.2388188	0.0998	-0.156140160719	1.071653717	3489	2784	3435.6293	2783.2711	0.8922153	0.7362411	0.2772	-0.0248019312941	1.21185218	8366	7133	7771.5304	7553.3585	1.8053982	1.754164	0.0415	-0.195106683317	1.029207219	6439	5412	6071.3724	5629.7934	1.6834339	1.5780121	0.0933	-0.0666106787425	1.066806820	2068	1602	2124.3204	1539.6526	0.6209292	0.469975	0.4018	-0.0834789479904	1.3211962!sample_table_end
