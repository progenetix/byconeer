Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481689/suppl/GSM481689_JBH087.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5014	5124	5279.4594	4840.2293	1.4145406	1.1994714	0.2379	0.0996403324709	1.17930342	4387	5065	4635.1038	4784.3955	1.3776925	1.3488072	0.0306	0.00436058551882	1.02141543	4144	4633	4381.8039	4376.1828	1.0014751	0.9625799	0.0571	-0.0627594253588	1.04040734	6918	9130	7251.0165	8630.3534	1.4823348	1.7380194	-0.2296	-0.205106329796	0.85288745	14133	17908	14603.171	17079.921	3.6885925	4.2219653	-0.1948	-0.117722696225	0.87366726	10841	12610	11254.879	11960.47	2.7835227	2.8873532	-0.0528	-0.0559667419022	0.96403967	4080	4597	4314.9401	4342.1436	0.9624313	1.0728547	-0.1567	-0.192807806632	0.89707528	5042	5294	5308.1857	5000.1508	0.9392718	0.898616	0.0638	0.00114807259237	1.04524279	9396	10858	9775.5739	10286.958	2.8564177	2.8270051	0.0149	-0.107347653305	1.010404110	15289	17637	15776.156	16813.47	2.5761972	2.7970318	-0.1187	-0.068191156005	0.921046811	22246	23157	22770.872	22176.136	3.9267278	3.957983	-0.0114	-0.0818647399865	0.992103212	5722	7684	6007.4239	7269.441	0.9723301	1.223118	-0.3310	-0.13773511076	0.794960213	11821	11729	12239.784	11125.517	1.7625353	1.7063452	0.0467	0.179995943612	1.032930114	5844	7262	6134.9834	6862.4472	2.1265186	2.203308	-0.0512	-0.00145927360501	0.965148115	7552	6852	7894.8553	6467.0731	1.2087916	1.0184725	0.2472	0.164303583094	1.186867216	5971	6651	6267.6539	6276.0636	1.0333571	1.085104	-0.0705	0.0446408777989	0.952311517	2524	2639	2700.7832	2492.7902	0.7782341	0.6810769	0.1924	0.0465399524437	1.142652318	4433	5326	4682.9745	5030.2301	1.4520085	1.4491983	0.0028	0.0615789409094	1.001939219	4489	4652	4741.1095	4394.1152	1.3489289	1.193164	0.1770	0.00676090481876	1.130547820	3588	3562	3800.0309	3369.2007	0.7021014	0.623687	0.1709	-0.000650239325551	1.1257273!sample_table_end
