Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9775!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481626/suppl/GSM481626_JA681.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1122	1512	1244.4597	1354.7018	0.6645419	0.7304614	0.1364	0.103980572158	1.09919542	1184	1741	1313.2825	1548.315	0.6727638	0.8455082	0.3297	0.172999216659	1.25676833	2094	3007	2308.3614	2626.2581	1.2171195	1.5222224	0.3227	0.222837939208	1.25067624	6033	7017	6219.4421	6193.5466	3.4638014	3.4451845	-0.0078	0.0591427344284	0.99462535	13937	12403	13146.659	11240.537	7.1188463	6.4517838	-0.1419	-0.119518241154	0.90629626	3099	5190	3361.5877	4544.3736	2.1685068	2.6405272	0.2841	0.134246704289	1.21767067	1128	1844	1251.092	1633.9303	0.8250788	0.963525	0.2238	0.246569465476	1.16779758	845	1556	932.3377	1392.7913	0.7582515	1.0144986	0.4200	0.144687149461	1.33794479	2159	2501	2376.4433	2193.258	1.2160842	1.0922853	-0.1549	0.124973100504	0.898198710	2348	3718	2575.2296	3250.4968	3.5096438	3.5063435	-0.0014	-0.00556160527517	0.999059611	3055	3391	3316.6276	2964.7849	2.6288955	2.0876899	-0.3325	-0.282467640344	0.794131912	4777	5665	5026.8828	4967.1808	2.8378528	2.8832292	0.0229	0.0918046182223	1.015989613	1399	2193	1551.4138	1935.7824	1.2532346	1.4008091	0.1606	0.157902214031	1.117754914	8182	6548	8171.4752	5768.2269	4.0966686	2.9231064	-0.4869	0.0626547472819	0.713532515	589	875	635.2085	822.7612	0.6150421	0.7755772	0.3346	0.231082997996	1.261014616	3319	3902	3585.702	3411.908	1.6917615	1.6353132	-0.0490	0.0592342633794	0.966633417	525	504	557.5202	519.7363	0.4397889	0.477319	0.1181	0.0584615544884	1.085336518	1532	2396	1700.7468	2105.7093	0.8245945	1.1982252	0.5391	0.14227043569	1.453108419	864	914	954.139	854.8614	0.6314402	0.6859559	0.1195	0.105594275795	1.086335420	1879	1996	2077.559	1765.7508	1.085815	1.0090966	-0.1057	0.0174943794593	0.9293449!sample_table_end
