Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481728/suppl/GSM481728_JBH376.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5786	6068	5600.5602	6251.9414	0.9678824	1.0413887	0.1056	0.119515810964	1.07594542	9149	9711	8862.4424	9921.7548	1.8421915	1.9762561	0.1013	0.0218912987318	1.07277453	7719	7350	7474.0929	7520.5248	1.0747405	1.0892406	0.0193	0.0601549071495	1.01349174	29689	26801	27628.194	26624.512	4.1388751	4.0292942	-0.0387	-0.0056828448317	0.97352395	37575	38374	34319.862	38215.839	5.1965489	5.5955715	0.1067	0.091314748172	1.0767866	20689	23716	19691.799	23523.761	3.1602662	3.7199377	0.2352	0.247571017422	1.17709627	9198	9444	8909.5852	9658.8475	1.2501559	1.3980468	0.1613	0.25896194647	1.11829798	6867	6812	6656.2424	6979.0957	0.9639788	1.0282596	0.0931	0.0768500674325	1.06668279	4738	4166	4578.212	4352.9692	0.8880651	0.8161479	-0.1218	-0.0507562275519	0.91901810	20220	17421	19268.578	17416.477	3.1737898	2.9253771	-0.1176	0.0531452654669	0.921729911	25692	16949	24154.547	16962.624	3.7959129	2.771177	-0.4539	-0.328686117387	0.730042212	22498	25838	21299.345	25663.63	3.0819929	3.8135736	0.3073	0.0361849738009	1.237372513	7187	6300	6959.3892	6477.4428	1.1284978	1.0950716	-0.0434	0.145135226009	0.970379914	17055	17326	16352.312	17325.264	3.2763049	3.3214829	0.0198	0.000522882185651	1.013789315	6706	6321	6500.7982	6497.8417	0.9073493	0.9239915	0.0262	0.121377786971	1.018341516	7548	7306	7307.6987	7476.0319	0.9885428	1.0331496	0.0637	0.0303838260189	1.045123817	1924	1264	1849.7975	1434.356	0.3747506	0.2795561	-0.4228	0.0735330364309	0.745978918	9387	9878	9094.8556	10086.057	1.3963822	1.494388	0.0979	-0.0013433848167	1.070185419	3611	2963	3479.1919	3152.1484	0.7089212	0.6385463	-0.1508	0.0381159998782	0.900729520	3443	3513	3318.1019	3691.7108	0.5786972	0.6693353	0.2099	0.0204502851326	1.1566243!sample_table_end
