Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481493/suppl/GSM481493_DE402.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2610	2021	2069.9015	2478.0648	1.3166803	1.5011975	-0.1892	-0.172974895516	0.87708672	2079	1188	1687.2283	1441.249	1.3894502	0.9911567	0.4873	0.205485853465	1.4018473	4260	2558	3193.9985	3159.5672	1.5030582	1.7568606	-0.2251	-0.241485078239	0.85553644	7482	2874	5329.063	3558.9958	2.9427622	2.1956748	0.4225	0.323870039832	1.34025415	22385	7565	15036.194	9345.0847	6.3280464	5.2142598	0.2793	0.256342115252	1.2136046	9398	4111	6572.731	5089.9326	3.1843006	2.9362319	0.1170	0.109423414737	1.08448547	2871	1085	2256.1122	1313.8462	1.1940801	0.7627434	0.6466	0.340147146087	1.56550688	1435	709	1209.0722	853.3557	0.7484083	0.5590124	0.4209	0.199405246837	1.33880459	1931	1618	1578.7677	1971.5758	1.314173	1.3195158	-0.0059	-0.291998235618	0.995950910	3810	4116	2891.6059	5095.8776	2.4543316	4.1782551	-0.7676	-0.425804398799	0.587405911	16991	12035	11548.479	15128.09	8.9790067	12.021404	-0.4210	-0.221108244256	0.746918312	4089	2327	3077.981	2869.0677	1.9181836	1.7980324	0.0933	0.253716549922	1.066823713	2364	3342	1894.2024	4159.3919	1.8194437	3.0983962	-0.7680	-0.550237261662	0.587221114	7094	5055	5072.5264	6233.0397	4.0709649	4.1019396	-0.0109	-0.170614969398	0.992448815	4912	3536	3637.0662	4399.7383	2.1585815	2.7254481	-0.3364	-0.255546312482	0.792009716	2813	2206	2214.0697	2711.6602	1.2479071	1.5897976	-0.3493	-0.327247005447	0.784947217	1378	1355	1164.7689	1647.4035	0.8870148	1.0689234	-0.2691	-0.273529806997	0.829820818	4625	2748	3443.7185	3399.0114	1.5452921	1.7791471	-0.2033	-0.186615934147	0.868557819	1217	1574	1037.6216	1917.7328	0.944843	1.3856491	-0.5524	-0.282538199027	0.681877620	740	624	657.1549	755.8114	0.6726192	0.6084726	0.1446	-0.168247257415	1.1054224!sample_table_end
