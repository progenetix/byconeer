Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481648/suppl/GSM481648_JA802.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2102	2384	2292.1676	2094.5505	1.0903625	1.0951462	0.0063	-0.17538122558	1.00438722	2046	2308	2235.0129	2029.8931	1.5152629	1.0419446	-0.5403	-0.15055274401	0.68763293	1921	2194	2106.351	1937.6118	0.9737328	1.1850494	0.2833	0.0833856302217	1.2170174	7337	4453	7030.9831	3805.2458	3.1641461	2.2417155	-0.4972	-0.251501429157	0.70847415	15628	8234	13958.584	7057.5458	6.2515247	3.9602671	-0.6586	-0.471277148601	0.63348826	5788	5048	5683.9623	4295.7573	2.7838309	2.8046082	0.0107	0.0978666837627	1.00746357	2066	2780	2255.4356	2424.2599	1.2585447	1.130884	-0.1543	0.16103141852	0.89856488	1899	1689	2083.5919	1530.3043	0.9080819	0.767322	-0.2430	-0.0765312670606	0.84499219	2450	3092	2634.9358	2672.9635	1.7850769	1.2751694	-0.4853	-0.290476487092	0.714349810	3830	5777	3936.6212	4913.2879	1.6895695	2.2195292	0.3936	0.00749664153463	1.313665511	9602	9291	8988.0058	8007.6109	3.796441	3.830994	0.0131	-0.115691936476	1.009101412	3244	5526	3409.1953	4699.6535	1.853308	2.1215475	0.1950	0.0673186178201	1.144735513	1277	3941	1454.2674	3375.2596	0.9178109	1.3982421	0.6073	-0.0551044867743	1.523453314	4967	6090	4961.2252	5180.7484	3.8356677	2.8623105	-0.4223	-0.386333211546	0.746235215	2389	4429	2572.4963	3785.5156	1.2633889	1.5810152	0.3236	0.0480820015901	1.251408116	1368	2393	1551.5011	2102.202	0.7844688	0.9127038	0.2184	-0.109206323983	1.163467317	851	1376	1010.0582	1273.2491	0.6477369	0.6560826	0.0185	0.0556778142665	1.012884518	1922	2651	2107.3848	2319.6902	1.3276652	1.6917391	0.3496	0.0237386540311	1.274221119	687	1956	827.5588	1743.5472	0.5657303	0.8828868	0.6421	0.00709501168277	1.560614220	1315	1028	1494.5434	993.2363	0.6650703	0.5022114	-0.4052	-0.0201439566514	0.7551254!sample_table_end
