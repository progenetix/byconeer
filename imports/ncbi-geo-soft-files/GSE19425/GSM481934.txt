Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481934/suppl/GSM481934_MR360.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4623	2984	4229.065	3282.746	1.3869367	1.0658488	-0.3799	0.15214550927	0.76849132	4165	4020	3805.1985	4381.645	1.3353068	1.6311005	0.2887	0.0452276688087	1.22151743	4199	3561	3836.6527	3894.853	1.1401466	1.1271706	-0.0165	0.0830214727912	0.9886194	12052	10178	11191.099	10773.445	2.7590974	2.6702045	-0.0472	-0.0995217825255	0.96778195	16065	17392	14895.965	18408.417	4.8953391	5.8355489	0.2535	-0.104680190531	1.19206236	9930	7793	9209.6745	8304.0525	2.9609127	2.6001052	-0.1875	-0.00967681172538	0.87814327	3511	3619	3195.467	3956.6106	0.832729	0.8967514	0.1069	0.0185621087962	1.07688268	4312	3650	3941.1852	3989.6093	0.797144	0.8194268	0.0398	-0.00527500714691	1.02795339	5271	3671	4834.2644	4011.9601	1.7671159	1.5738355	-0.1671	0.00918576485835	0.890623810	16335	15297	15143.939	16175.217	2.8209238	3.1104195	0.1409	0.0209160423449	1.102624511	35632	29745	32782.519	31674.068	6.4017957	6.4526284	0.0114	-0.056810394417	1.007940412	12208	13863	11335.582	14651.661	2.3655512	3.0129222	0.3490	-0.133706758695	1.273666113	9793	8836	9080.9105	9387.9521	1.6342225	1.5954905	-0.0346	0.0308352315971	0.976299414	11819	12071	10975.272	12763	3.8768542	4.5806889	0.2407	-0.137109707332	1.181547915	7846	6247	7244.2704	6697.274	1.3697031	1.2670913	-0.1123	0.0437489068026	0.925084616	4909	5594	4495.8654	6017.9116	0.9662468	1.2046169	0.3181	-0.0303197337747	1.24669717	2034	1651	1837.3067	1852.1275	0.6310782	0.6592329	0.0630	0.146300955942	1.044613618	4639	3901	4243.8804	4256.5227	1.6016759	1.4638112	-0.1299	-0.00681694461478	0.913924719	3909	2785	3566.7427	3070.6512	1.1292978	1.0307174	-0.1318	0.0290577470366	0.912706520	3907	3163	3564.8792	3472.7277	0.6123751	0.6356144	0.0537	-0.00712930825113	1.0379495!sample_table_end
