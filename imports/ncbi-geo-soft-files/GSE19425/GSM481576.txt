Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481576/suppl/GSM481576_EL638.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4985	3463	4671.9564	3714.2377	0.9329155	0.7651973	-0.2859	-0.0165919740369	0.82022142	5838	5915	5497.9425	6133.4741	1.383132	1.5563788	0.1703	0.165378163598	1.12525683	4073	3776	3791.6108	4026.7139	0.7477808	0.8243354	0.1406	0.155243423721	1.10237574	17708	14782	16718.701	14593.565	3.683129	3.2373977	-0.1861	-0.117210712787	0.87898025	19254	21218	18159.093	20929.93	4.096841	4.7672037	0.2186	-0.317269839443	1.16362916	14439	11790	13668.589	11747.212	2.9984859	2.6853229	-0.1591	-0.019207163471	0.89555967	3160	3913	2913.4875	4163.2255	0.8537112	1.1312696	0.4061	0.021282000679	1.32511988	3182	2571	2934.4249	2807.6164	0.7632224	0.721776	-0.0806	-0.00209258793218	0.94569549	4932	3789	4619.9182	4039.6838	1.1689089	1.0464428	-0.1597	-0.0326852116957	0.895230410	13505	12384	12793.112	12307.756	4.2856001	3.9824315	-0.1058	-0.0800436703698	0.929258711	12578	10030	11928.37	10086.028	3.810932	3.1892635	-0.2569	-0.0894798289593	0.836872312	8380	7599	7952.5727	7753.2381	2.3899288	2.1275034	-0.1678	0.00864894819946	0.890195213	2638	2481	2424.0484	2717.6755	1.016114	0.9272651	-0.1320	-0.012454840627	0.9125614	10622	9109	10080.335	9204.854	2.4336374	2.2992442	-0.0820	0.00942872916691	0.944776715	3491	2917	3231.5805	3161.1254	0.9283117	0.8322919	-0.1575	-0.0372866654124	0.896565116	3490	3735	3230.6068	3985.7797	0.8753578	1.0162015	0.2152	-0.114132800209	1.160898417	1679	1187	1543.3793	1371.2655	0.3642915	0.3297413	-0.1438	0.0924426350577	0.905157718	7849	6587	7441.3127	6786.004	1.5592753	1.4821548	-0.0732	0.0196744478291	0.950540719	3915	2948	3640.9357	3193.2249	0.9235813	0.8205159	-0.1707	-0.0497984101883	0.888406720	3285	2253	3032.5105	2485.518	0.919606	0.7769574	-0.2432	-0.0269056821025	0.8448807!sample_table_end
