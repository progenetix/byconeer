Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481858/suppl/GSM481858_MR254.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	7041	5669	6810.4525	5841.6501	1.62704	1.3603682	-0.2583	-0.216912622247	0.83610012	4658	5609	4470.094	5781.4665	1.1013708	1.3962109	0.3422	0.264133561088	1.26770283	5801	4171	5584.8847	4344.2105	1.3602108	1.0430595	-0.3830	-0.195371625887	0.76683664	11359	11445	11072.729	11461.668	2.7615499	2.8479629	0.0445	0.206786736248	1.03129155	15935	16935	15619.892	16799.702	3.8663784	4.0748313	0.0758	0.112478224183	1.05391436	8568	8841	8318.7322	8936.1945	2.1264189	2.2330426	0.0706	0.0499449204381	1.05014247	3378	3395	3234.7688	3553.7862	0.6887665	0.7469936	0.1171	0.0681695805266	1.08453818	3400	3300	3255.2338	3458.2026	0.7555143	0.8092548	0.0991	0.0444089484385	1.07113119	7201	6192	6968.2818	6350.6677	1.6803064	1.5042085	-0.1597	-0.273078998698	0.895198910	11880	12086	11600.68	12075.275	2.8000942	2.9702995	0.0851	0.0352521391408	1.060785611	17849	16019	17479.475	15906.912	4.0776117	3.7990495	-0.1021	-0.126198012586	0.93168512	10390	10323	10103.568	10384.392	2.1553347	2.2458927	0.0594	0.00745918186261	1.042015713	7706	6935	7466.3204	7080.6223	1.8997473	1.7589795	-0.1111	-0.203198140222	0.925901814	14355	15226	14075.537	15124.873	3.1143802	3.228425	0.0519	0.0296882211287	1.036618815	7005	5899	6774.953	6066.0941	1.4570403	1.2975177	-0.1673	-0.199038044049	0.89051616	5830	5240	5613.1848	5411.5125	1.1579298	1.1248728	-0.0418	-0.132619630916	0.971451617	3435	2529	3288.9224	2661.3037	0.8150284	0.6526888	-0.3205	-0.288335662621	0.800817218	7915	6552	7672.0066	6702.9737	1.5922058	1.3162733	-0.2746	-0.208365555032	0.82669819	5118	4088	4916.5831	4260.0965	1.3522231	1.1413735	-0.2446	-0.195480127635	0.844071920	4044	2994	3875.7115	3146.622	0.9213828	0.7841676	-0.2326	-0.187842229254	0.8510769!sample_table_end
