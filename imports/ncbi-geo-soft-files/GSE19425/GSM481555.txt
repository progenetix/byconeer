Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481555/suppl/GSM481555_EL213.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3244	2477	3049.1156	2638.66	0.9211186	0.7928829	0.2163	0.037083038238	1.16173342	4003	3823	3761.9715	4014.1148	1.1593688	1.2674015	-0.1285	-0.348480419792	0.91476053	1609	1314	1505.8868	1426.2726	0.5025346	0.4519667	0.1530	-0.199833944861	1.1118844	11460	13093	10869.235	13295.21	3.7604838	4.5712069	-0.2817	-0.223710701753	0.82264575	20217	26620	18962.195	26995.55	6.8402895	9.2622012	-0.4373	-0.0928697137902	0.73851666	8337	9218	7912.644	9432.4735	2.8284589	3.2980384	-0.2216	-0.143221149168	0.85761857	1854	2344	1736.2099	2499.2232	0.7074119	0.9560183	-0.4345	-0.388193087038	0.73995648	2501	2722	2346.6322	2892.6719	0.8523402	1.0557647	-0.3088	-0.213364447517	0.80732039	5001	4049	4720.9415	4244.2002	1.3688325	1.2630117	0.1161	-0.0397350666986	1.083784410	9873	9437	9370.1168	9647.9106	4.0524166	4.3290821	-0.0953	-0.0610292251864	0.936091411	8653	9760	8211.8719	9969.5587	3.2197302	4.0578338	-0.3338	-0.353210455219	0.793460312	4427	5557	4163.1937	5770.4717	1.7424784	2.3206507	-0.4134	-0.350555200587	0.750857613	1966	1757	1842.2405	1891.4054	0.7938748	0.8171823	-0.0417	-0.0918525990134	0.971478314	12392	13265	11740.705	13468.091	3.6945783	4.2830791	-0.2132	-0.19799768234	0.862598615	1908	1741	1787.1988	1874.7848	0.6981949	0.7085364	-0.0212	-0.0454773312033	0.985404316	1671	2281	1564.587	2432.5369	0.6067174	0.9072527	-0.5805	-0.181411094431	0.668741317	476	327	429.7169	379.4105	0.138747	0.1247012	0.1540	-0.0694569067289	1.112635318	4705	4592	4432.5336	4793.8132	1.25586	1.3469049	-0.1010	-0.129393878793	0.932404319	1964	1491	1840.3414	1610.4628	0.6392298	0.5724786	0.1591	0.0063738643942	1.116600220	3862	2530	3631.1363	2693.8314	1.276006	1.0161036	0.3286	0.0550492945014	1.2557834!sample_table_end
