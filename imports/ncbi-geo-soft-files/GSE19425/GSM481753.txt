Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481753/suppl/GSM481753_JBH523.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2242	2478	2326.5904	2372.3142	0.9404189	0.9462616	-0.0089	-0.142870322698	0.99382552	2576	2748	2661.1781	2635.5628	1.2102243	1.1290832	0.1001	0.0253772678236	1.07186463	1707	1710	1782.03	1637.2121	0.6918723	0.6556008	0.0777	-0.0240119758253	1.05532554	8990	8155	8841.7764	7835.3297	3.5624557	3.3571228	0.0856	-0.324208055243	1.06116345	10042	14254	9816.3805	13785.308	4.1821184	5.9865062	-0.5175	-0.48325759519	0.69859086	6447	7692	6441.6393	7387.7427	2.738401	3.2388562	-0.2422	-0.300175986783	0.8454847	2119	2296	2201.4085	2200.2227	1.080963	1.121018	-0.0525	-0.0843643459782	0.96426918	1788	2158	1864.7004	2069.7584	0.7897866	0.9209339	-0.2216	-0.32026029392	0.85759329	3440	3966	3520.875	3793.705	1.5049302	1.5312118	-0.0250	-0.112247004173	0.982836110	7625	8734	7564.3951	8397.3641	3.9252077	4.504843	-0.1987	-0.157901748299	0.871330611	7361	8455	7316.9806	8125.5563	3.5075631	4.0832045	-0.2192	-0.209452339512	0.859022212	3787	3907	3860.7415	3736.5849	2.1159812	2.1777253	-0.0415	-0.313139887095	0.971647413	1568	1599	1641.9609	1533.1485	1.0528267	1.0815757	-0.0389	-0.0510490760703	0.973419314	4678	6818	4742.1586	6546.6755	2.6539117	3.140597	-0.2429	-0.386913576775	0.845034115	1356	1401	1429.1885	1345.9135	0.7314698	0.7392182	-0.0152	0.0450818324162	0.989518116	1284	1801	1354.4628	1723.9238	0.6788456	0.9229027	-0.4431	-0.110483329125	0.735554917	675	864	722.673	839.0972	0.3306934	0.3664806	-0.1482	0.0105277925916	0.902348918	2878	3825	2970.1931	3658.6595	1.4896223	1.6459298	-0.1440	-0.171983319383	0.905033919	1098	1383	1161.3947	1328.7966	0.5566074	0.6029855	-0.1155	-0.0249666032325	0.923085920	1834	1802	1911.1701	1724.9089	0.9785002	0.8788247	0.1550	-0.121797709191	1.1134191!sample_table_end
