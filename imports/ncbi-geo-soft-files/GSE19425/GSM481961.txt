Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481961/suppl/GSM481961_MR389.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	8605	6423	7548.0227	6988.7732	1.5121982	1.4441705	0.0664	-0.08998020554	1.0471052	8988	7854	7838.6183	8622.9244	1.6512118	1.8462952	-0.1611	-0.0626810868979	0.89433783	5726	3853	5259.8197	4153.0381	1.0604724	0.8470065	0.3243	0.00986409911376	1.25202394	15096	11190	12624.391	12430.6	2.5841007	2.5869685	-0.0016	-0.134890002129	0.99889145	22322	13600	18653.247	15149.544	3.9804263	3.2017529	0.3141	0.28903837356	1.24320216	11656	7558	9922.5686	8282.3424	2.0922137	1.797483	0.2191	-0.0801929909298	1.16396857	3012	2536	2838.6697	2785.0142	0.6954854	0.644384	0.1101	0.107367696078	1.07930278	3436	2958	3250.5557	3226.0194	0.7032465	0.7103721	-0.0145	-0.035369253973	0.98996919	7937	7095	7040.1485	7758.9263	1.4333115	1.5838037	-0.1440	-0.146449945014	0.904980510	14056	10787	11775.186	11983.407	3.0572388	3.1406843	-0.0388	-0.054963330534	0.973430811	17102	16357	14249.348	18150.09	3.5008978	4.4898465	-0.3589	-0.405480763253	0.779736612	10749	9629	9226.9054	10677.175	2.3148114	2.5041599	-0.1134	-0.0711421256065	0.924386413	5232	5709	4841.2772	6191.4383	1.5442712	1.7682039	-0.1954	-0.142405101826	0.873355814	14872	11774	12440.93	13089.699	2.7805774	3.0216675	-0.1200	-0.0661113932545	0.920212915	4297	5710	4033.0667	6192.513	0.955603	1.4097822	-0.5610	-0.447901381654	0.677837316	3942	4342	3705.8204	4672.7718	0.9055632	1.0557186	-0.2213	-0.0252022610822	0.857769517	2774	2130	2608.4261	2368.9931	0.5316345	0.5192393	0.0340	-0.0464474650936	1.023871818	6906	7694	6222.8891	8438.7488	1.2459158	1.6808654	-0.4320	-0.47423262286	0.741234719	4280	4046	4017.8299	4352.0477	0.8744601	1.0132599	-0.2125	-0.148401832153	0.863016620	3648	3236	3444.0601	3512.4805	0.8009017	0.8563253	-0.0965	-0.187173998732	0.9352774!sample_table_end
