Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481496/suppl/GSM481496_DE403.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1968	1630	1627.3639	1914.2446	1.2090403	1.2429288	0.0399	0.00397692895533	1.02802932	842	1068	751.8108	1255.5371	0.7233619	0.928237	0.3598	0.119197056766	1.28322623	3773	2247	2864.1427	2623.522	1.2760824	1.4181487	0.1523	0.141426251046	1.11133014	4628	3060	3443.689	3612.4674	2.0165788	2.2297475	0.1450	0.164913167952	1.10570815	16436	6109	10946.714	7465.3877	4.0030728	3.9332258	-0.0254	0.0926673760728	0.98255176	10114	4717	7036.5171	5673.7698	3.2101146	3.1234556	-0.0395	-0.203788395044	0.97300447	1990	906	1643.4108	1073.1269	1.0575458	0.8487304	-0.3173	-0.206601929997	0.80254728	1269	830	1096.8722	986.8489	0.7737224	0.6526105	-0.2456	-0.217577461129	0.84346859	1823	1642	1519.0856	1927.9588	1.372624	1.4100472	0.0388	-0.283262936929	1.02726410	3270	3768	2537.6447	4483.9318	2.6127809	3.8398332	0.5555	0.0868704339188	1.469634611	9996	8644	6961.0353	10891.991	6.2150379	8.921185	0.5215	0.20799352451	1.435419212	1673	1299	1403.7935	1525.2035	1.3959594	1.575748	0.1748	0.294267019192	1.128792213	1082	1315	948.2544	1543.8099	1.9159268	2.6144165	0.4484	0.202435525936	1.364570114	5181	3832	3819.895	4562.9081	2.55047	2.8725123	0.1715	0.11459597215	1.126267815	1968	1638	1627.3639	1923.3878	1.5699395	1.8298833	0.2210	0.177173966906	1.165575616	1834	1305	1527.4502	1532.1808	1.2166779	1.3429409	0.1424	0.0753713415105	1.103776817	901	869	800.5053	1031.0319	0.8564205	0.7816677	-0.1318	-0.0420550698117	0.912714818	7570	3112	5387.162	3676.2767	1.5878228	1.6391578	0.0459	0.0447994859407	1.032330419	955	1304	843.1774	1531.0174	1.078722	1.2700281	0.2355	-0.0313995329079	1.177345120	663	563	586.8245	694.0542	0.7322285	0.6167602	-0.2476	-0.0987301532912	0.8423057!sample_table_end
