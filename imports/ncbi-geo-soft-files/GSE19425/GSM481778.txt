Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481778/suppl/GSM481778_JBH552.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1562	2083	1777.855	1811.9003	1.0568001	1.0659356	0.0124	0.169341650004	1.00864452	1574	2069	1790.5254	1799.4638	1.196695	1.0966534	-0.1259	-0.15327020774	0.91640173	825	1267	981.91469	1087.1256	0.4815239	0.6053423	0.3301	0.186980193024	1.25713864	9659	7396	9514.8249	6776.6718	5.1201571	4.1146896	-0.3154	0.049138076429	0.80362565	10227	11627	10034.995	10825.177	5.1447731	6.3176045	0.2963	0.00590654886412	1.22796566	7071	6322	7132.7815	5738.4937	3.7776	3.3646057	-0.1670	-0.0496395549905	0.89067287	1450	1782	1657.2339	1542.4493	1.1104635	1.1391569	0.0368	0.0139535678972	1.02583918	1658	1424	1878.7618	1225.3092	1.0347463	0.7458587	-0.4723	-0.200438141897	0.72081319	2999	3257	3240.9197	2870.0063	1.9991744	1.5974521	-0.3236	-0.0668924528107	0.799055810	4747	6616	4939.2964	6022.8378	3.6234141	4.2780379	0.2396	0.134225540603	1.180664911	7156	7833	7212.622	7196.8806	4.8715005	5.1280243	0.0740	0.039607702434	1.05265812	2307	2787	2549.4895	2437.0903	1.873338	1.9460979	0.0550	0.189284375981	1.038839613	866	1615	1026.2441	1393.3433	0.9499176	1.1518144	0.2780	0.149974811645	1.212541314	5525	7055	5681.6156	6447.1951	4.2474772	3.7600714	-0.1758	-0.00975278899901	0.885248115	1024	1497	1197.5204	1288.5096	0.7773693	0.9192396	0.2418	0.130795684944	1.182500516	924	1536	1087.8516	1321.9679	0.7039287	0.9721234	0.4657	0.15679280172	1.38099717	437	749	546.5048	644.50894	0.3791885	0.4186956	0.1430	-0.0523238799472	1.104188618	2327	3204	2569.9682	2821.2405	1.4568869	1.4637321	0.0068	-0.0301931208676	1.004698419	689	1421	832.09933	1222.6508	0.5735486	0.7690687	0.4232	0.14128275854	1.340895320	1124	1545	1306.4924	1329.9236	0.9235374	0.8291581	-0.1555	0.124816450948	0.8978067!sample_table_end
