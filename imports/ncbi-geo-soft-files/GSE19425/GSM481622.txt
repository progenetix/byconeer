Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481622/suppl/GSM481622_EL692.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1997	2065	2007.7485	2025.9574	0.8922904	0.9264317	0.0542	0.0146529431082	1.03826242	2169	2203	2189.5682	2153.2049	1.3347175	1.2062227	-0.1460	0.00565566167161	0.90372883	1277	1466	1255.6413	1483.3117	0.5496364	0.7000584	0.3490	0.194211895324	1.27367534	21457	11570	19716.077	11172.843	7.6706852	4.8967134	-0.6475	-0.122191103059	0.63836715	10023	16137	9673.1542	15794.853	4.743606	7.961664	0.7471	0.0270843927112	1.6783996	16725	13825	15637.733	13443.145	7.4004315	6.9546433	-0.0896	-0.0144168429787	0.93976187	1378	2271	1361.2619	2216.2509	0.9893152	1.3888089	0.4893	0.129503015286	1.40380838	1377	1331	1360.2069	1362.4217	0.6689965	0.7441145	0.1535	-0.0150000093519	1.11228459	3649	4185	3686.6234	3994.9244	2.4468808	2.3451972	-0.0612	0.125142167678	0.958443510	14267	16420	13477.393	16087.436	6.5209143	8.3912851	0.3638	0.145277422728	1.286826411	4061	4634	4087.1893	4424.6189	2.1714433	2.5822427	0.2500	-0.0186583338568	1.189182612	3952	3965	3983.249	3787.5342	2.3202297	2.0859774	-0.1535	-0.000226232319489	0.899039113	1090	1370	1053.8205	1397.3741	0.6717942	0.8216727	0.2905	0.274135444151	1.223101714	1443	1923	1429.9765	1896.0278	1.2995758	1.5321781	0.2375	0.110642801083	1.178983215	914	889	851.2124	968.8969	0.5188234	0.595513	0.1989	0.194835445187	1.147814516	1213	1631	1187.9078	1633.9903	0.7263346	0.9088213	0.3234	0.086765290833	1.251243317	600	551	480.985	651.2507	0.2670986	0.3381417	0.3403	0.0589825101676	1.265980718	3638	4291	3675.7053	4096.2423	2.1890825	2.2009784	0.0078	0.0199459600881	1.005434219	707	741	599.8647	832.2327	0.3461271	0.4624829	0.4181	0.145438388156	1.336164820	2610	2430	2645.4353	2364.5431	1.0108409	1.0435583	0.0460	0.156083319056	1.0323665!sample_table_end
