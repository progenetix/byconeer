Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481683/suppl/GSM481683_JA949.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1409	1180	1357.4564	1217.2559	1.1434719	1.0238187	0.1595	-0.0928169708929	1.11686952	957	974	912.9159	1012.1893	0.8487391	0.9306194	-0.1329	-0.0286518804335	0.91201523	1353	1217	1302.7903	1254.4097	1.1044626	1.0346959	0.0941	-0.16280447368	1.06742724	2478	1873	2389.0549	1913.5802	2.8430018	2.3082554	0.3006	0.176542351989	1.23166695	5480	5452	5236.2016	5581.9401	4.1870702	4.6827062	-0.1614	-0.0183763114504	0.8941566	4388	3908	4209.3286	3991.1468	3.4103237	3.1576152	0.1111	0.0902471002101	1.08003147	718	537	679.8052	570.1753	1.1343076	1.0242417	0.1473	0.296814828417	1.10746088	812	742	771.7404	780.143	1.064424	1.0894513	-0.0335	0.0694060366576	0.97702769	1136	1157	1088.5796	1194.3076	0.9517457	1.0238426	-0.1053	0.0475358760848	0.929581910	1779	1827	1717.5918	1868.0136	2.6166776	2.776558	-0.0856	-0.105447263018	0.942417711	2707	2404	2609.4089	2451.937	3.9710133	3.682772	0.1087	-0.104437236116	1.078267412	681	551	644.5993	583.992	1.2549369	1.198283	0.0666	0.0628543430759	1.047279213	736	690	697.2596	726.9555	1.3139978	1.3803483	-0.0711	-0.060207349836	0.95193214	3622	3638	3483.7139	3714.8151	2.7039646	2.7494753	-0.0241	0.129239751933	0.983447515	555	459	523.0607	491.9378	0.8846237	0.8534015	0.0518	0.00603887212781	1.036585616	612	488	577.4347	521.0709	1.0741616	1.0482837	0.0352	0.0266340779101	1.024685917	692	537	655.065	570.1753	0.5782617	0.5108395	0.1789	-0.0450909249163	1.131983218	2156	1941	2079.2339	1980.9541	1.2489567	1.2487305	0.0003	-0.0216325606961	1.000181119	1183	1028	1134.5554	1065.6667	1.0362341	0.9446638	0.1335	-0.02254314607	1.096934320	868	691	826.3379	727.9823	0.7307644	0.6241805	0.2274	0.0869915970673	1.1707581!sample_table_end
