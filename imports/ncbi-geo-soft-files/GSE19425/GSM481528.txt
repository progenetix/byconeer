Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481528/suppl/GSM481528_DE491.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1314	1184	973.8535	1601.5321	0.5568147	0.7865452	0.4983	0.27725970756	1.41257982	3426	2587	2641.4018	3276.9375	1.5326805	1.895591	0.3066	0.371620750811	1.23678153	2207	2520	1647.0697	3199.2359	0.695663	1.2782618	0.8777	0.690175069006	1.83747264	14045	10556	12219.607	10527.492	5.0513616	4.2135538	-0.2616	-0.289792366436	0.83414215	15207	9207	13237.708	9402.019	5.7575929	3.9756588	-0.5343	-0.391028276441	0.69050716	10687	5707	9208.2782	6378.2845	4.4873423	2.8707881	-0.6444	-0.660236199473	0.63975247	4091	2071	3196.6283	2686.9578	1.4928903	1.2531855	-0.2525	-0.0730492327901	0.83943578	3416	1713	2633.0179	2255.8691	1.0168417	0.860439	-0.2410	-0.176032018676	0.84618769	1988	922	1478.612	1267.353	0.7443789	0.6715948	-0.1484	-0.0862710426824	0.902221710	11179	6352	9651.5641	6952.7553	3.7985493	2.8665536	-0.4061	-0.461994296536	0.754644311	8376	7467	7109.6299	7930.1401	2.6689341	3.1219028	0.2262	0.18083873772	1.169718912	10071	11630	8657.4579	11408.777	3.9758412	4.9982277	0.3302	-0.04419209263	1.257149713	3243	2224	2483.877	2862.1494	0.9140362	1.1289993	0.3047	0.119585263471	1.235180114	7365	5449	6170.177	6142.8988	4.0536043	3.6185506	-0.1638	-0.138504212379	0.892674815	2043	1391	1519.1587	1864.3972	0.5996987	0.7131912	0.2501	0.227104843811	1.189249116	1878	1595	1395.5915	2110.8363	0.623277	0.9041705	0.5367	0.221681863345	1.450671817	432	265	317.4483	377.5565	0.1944224	0.2157493	0.1502	0.220904936918	1.109693618	6270	2814	5166.7653	3537.8827	2.0624423	1.6019459	-0.3645	-0.356920258309	0.776722719	1099	627	815.7331	883.9441	0.4703156	0.4815678	0.0341	-0.0707369056155	1.023924720	1917	1170	1425.2501	1583.6973	0.5809877	0.6616322	0.1875	0.0708613554401	1.1388057!sample_table_end
