Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481964/suppl/GSM481964_MR394.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	11320	3543	9254.7801	4196.4383	2.3841288	1.0774121	-1.1459	-0.142979630197	0.45191022	4408	3381	3648.0852	4014.6929	0.9945096	1.1149709	0.1649	0.157359645172	1.12112633	3814	2781	3160.9416	3341.0371	0.9231322	0.9859126	0.0949	0.0514378133303	1.0680084	15123	8320	12327.268	9533.5813	3.6488658	2.7224044	-0.4226	-0.0494649957191	0.7460965	19894	11217	16142.978	12656.385	5.502937	4.189956	-0.3933	-0.0831678123107	0.76140366	10118	6415	8271.899	7403.9298	2.5138791	2.3048154	-0.1253	-0.0487899363776	0.91683617	2353	2362	1969.2391	2878.8606	0.6787465	0.9393058	0.4687	0.13924197267	1.38388318	4856	2670	4001.4598	3214.739	1.1095906	0.8925268	-0.3141	-0.371352033201	0.80437499	4906	1771	4044.1861	2214.208	1.0557527	0.5976672	-0.8209	-0.21652951595	0.566105310	9164	7075	7500.584	8145.7523	2.3256333	2.3397258	0.0087	0.114315580128	1.006059611	20872	12302	16902.682	13806.28	4.8541708	3.9133016	-0.3108	-0.49022802023	0.80617312	14026	8958	11433.077	10215.289	3.5160265	2.983108	-0.2371	-0.127029660435	0.848431613	6439	3331	5295.4441	3958.5166	1.6439439	1.1021114	-0.5769	-0.0974696016343	0.670406914	17294	10040	14061.476	11382.933	4.1234329	3.5701863	-0.2078	-0.199419812916	0.865828615	6551	3286	5385.9496	3907.9498	1.4556064	0.9940042	-0.5503	-0.0281677795825	0.682879816	3452	2378	2878.5559	2896.9938	0.8799886	0.8582943	-0.0360	-0.264999609441	0.97534717	1398	734	1152.9227	967.4072	0.3239835	0.2748041	-0.2375	0.0253109254419	0.848203918	6993	2698	5742.6983	3246.6242	1.6730494	1.0180676	-0.7166	-0.355151152889	0.608510219	4846	2012	3993.4121	2488.3949	1.1495091	0.7126017	-0.6899	-0.120579429398	0.619918220	2576	1314	2157.1213	1675.3991	0.6221861	0.4631171	-0.4260	-0.31580789164	0.7443385!sample_table_end
