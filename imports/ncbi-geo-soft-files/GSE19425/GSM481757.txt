Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481757/suppl/GSM481757_JBH527.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1913	1823	1889.288	1813.2227	1.2421684	1.1321811	0.1338	-0.0470727320909	1.09714642	1257	1261	1172.3838	1317.6777	0.8279173	0.8138654	0.0247	0.0566125206965	1.01726563	1811	1475	1778.3409	1507.4436	1.2042495	1.0284458	0.2277	-0.00229851397737	1.17094114	6942	6207	7145.9698	5698.367	4.3853134	3.7443087	0.2280	-0.141096977665	1.17119445	6946	10235	7150.1009	9256.8015	5.7578891	7.4846648	-0.3784	-0.195162161964	0.76929156	4318	5127	4413.4636	4742.2535	3.3223424	3.5645933	-0.1015	-0.126974298954	0.93203977	1077	754	973.8851	864.1776	0.9869214	1.0176852	-0.0443	-0.0796762072174	0.96977098	1410	1382	1342.0587	1424.2983	0.7839989	0.9443027	-0.2684	-0.141379298535	0.83024119	1556	2154	1500.0188	2112.7415	1.0342858	1.2456502	-0.2683	-0.191561056783	0.83031810	5774	5413	5929.5076	4990.404	3.3378238	3.2943544	0.0189	-0.0600525934315	1.013195111	7063	6539	7270.9386	5994.4786	4.1678605	3.9985843	0.0598	-0.0219862638861	1.04233412	3888	2770	3968.6356	2663.3806	3.4628531	2.7897538	0.3118	-0.0636009694067	1.241275513	1082	1163	979.7549	1231.9635	1.1745283	1.3459965	-0.1966	-0.187614171663	0.872608814	4022	5762	4106.6702	5303.4546	3.3606315	3.6816929	-0.1316	-0.0876198465727	0.912795215	1518	945	1459.5221	1041.1777	1.0842254	0.9072784	0.2570	0.0367396315266	1.195030616	1001	773	884.3939	881.8282	0.8047164	0.9276357	-0.2051	-0.0173776131377	0.867491817	777	734	633.2026	845.5359	0.4393321	0.5283077	-0.2661	-0.251638299212	0.831583818	1735	2215	1695.2169	2168.2991	1.4141657	1.5470111	-0.1295	-0.145884408592	0.914127719	1179	1321	1087.8397	1370.0459	0.7788869	0.8624528	-0.1470	-0.0630934248659	0.903106720	1920	1352	1896.9475	1397.5247	0.961051	0.7675323	0.3244	-0.113252777802	1.252131!sample_table_end
