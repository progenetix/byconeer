Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481938/suppl/GSM481938_MR364.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	7779	6899	7919.6272	6678.8792	2.8444914	2.325312	-0.2907	0.133228918465	0.8174792	2663	3600	2740.966	3486.0004	1.0948856	1.3650557	0.3182	-0.117815008111	1.24675653	2265	2009	2331.528	1958.4234	0.7537938	0.6271834	-0.2653	-0.0146628657842	0.83203584	4011	4887	4121.2848	4721.4278	1.3240487	1.4834235	0.1640	-0.187904183541	1.12036935	10377	11233	10503.755	10991.707	3.8307904	3.8042136	-0.0100	-0.170616982921	0.99306236	9397	9875	9527.1464	9627.1388	3.1300083	3.1777193	0.0218	0.0750684296915	1.01524317	2575	2792	2650.1738	2711.9331	0.7578064	0.8534097	0.1714	-0.0106322727361	1.12615818	2493	2640	2565.5102	2562.7457	0.7899715	0.7709941	-0.0351	-0.00895690380615	0.97597719	9669	10307	9798.7123	10061.933	3.6028557	3.5838199	-0.0076	0.00190655958253	0.994716510	11341	12139	11450.754	11908.513	3.5609612	3.5906374	0.0120	-0.101909250799	1.008333811	20884	19427	20656.735	19392.386	6.4921407	6.0438051	-0.1032	-0.0221580277368	0.930941812	5079	6902	5213.8083	6681.829	1.5294087	1.9997803	0.3869	-0.116632760629	1.307551213	3246	3010	3335.4468	2923.7248	1.0539912	1.0056901	-0.0677	-0.105457072269	0.954173214	5383	6792	5522.4778	6573.7277	2.2696165	2.5503386	0.1682	-0.206451804122	1.12368715	2482	2580	2554.1633	2504.9703	0.7635225	0.7271869	-0.0703	-0.0526342542454	0.952410616	2503	2564	2575.8289	2489.5615	0.6936033	0.7202796	0.0544	-0.174479901693	1.038460417	1211	1192	1253.8165	1167.753	0.4836061	0.439234	-0.1388	0.0373414534308	0.908247318	5519	5899	5659.4975	5700.6281	2.0918533	1.9787728	-0.0802	0.004612704672	0.945942419	1820	1764	1874.2056	1721.2173	0.7210298	0.6487184	-0.1525	-0.0690398253621	0.89971120	2168	1854	2232.4555	1809.6579	0.6738853	0.550493	-0.2918	0.0579287689951	0.8168942!sample_table_end
