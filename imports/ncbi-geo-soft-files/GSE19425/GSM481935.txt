Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481935/suppl/GSM481935_MR361.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5467	5409	5480.437	5370.3011	1.2348461	1.211208	0.0279	0.0622408260637	1.01951622	5604	5436	5615.6585	5397.3389	1.3551133	1.3178559	0.0402	0.00957334159175	1.02827123	5719	4567	5728.575	4521.2637	1.1847397	0.9376558	0.3374	0.00840513536441	1.26351244	12456	11333	12284.924	11295.374	2.5815515	2.3468378	0.1375	-0.0948518314168	1.10001275	21471	21616	21243.437	21429.273	4.5721352	4.6754998	-0.0323	-0.18258439092	0.97789236	12903	11542	12723.248	11504.74	2.7660655	2.5181976	0.1354	0.0257806432156	1.09843077	5095	4518	5115.5003	4470.9723	0.9309261	0.8957142	0.0556	0.0039523265722	1.03931168	3716	4014	3769.4341	3963.3442	0.750656	0.7911653	-0.0758	0.00393880227645	0.94879799	10051	10091	9950.1249	10057.424	2.2470552	2.2928345	-0.0291	0.0370331213734	0.980033810	13525	13182	13332.413	13141.87	2.9359352	2.9471716	-0.0055	-0.0919771754533	0.996187411	26429	25097	26292.378	24794.064	6.0930967	5.6889393	0.0990	-0.0149060151915	1.071042712	12127	10705	11969.69	10667.751	2.5430256	2.3164849	0.1346	-0.135079804709	1.09779513	8170	8550	8112.6565	8512.1809	1.8868376	2.0756802	-0.1376	-0.0847111116789	0.909021314	17094	16896	16863.878	16807.907	3.8371442	3.9229058	-0.0319	-0.132444921995	0.978138215	6033	6168	6034.699	6128.0542	1.2342688	1.2730301	-0.0446	-0.0181344026893	0.969551916	5421	6011	5435.0245	5971.4159	1.028555	1.1811908	-0.1996	-0.0821740980284	0.87077817	2855	2823	2922.9052	2776.2063	0.7007704	0.679893	0.0436	0.060572332276	1.030706818	7468	7297	7426.2194	7254.7654	1.6111087	1.594147	0.0153	0.00935949925811	1.0106419	4605	4770	4642.5095	4730.2433	1.1283929	1.154489	-0.0330	-0.0260166801919	0.977395920	2543	2652	2619.071	2604.7036	0.5523355	0.5369608	0.0407	-0.0582285195558	1.0286329!sample_table_end
