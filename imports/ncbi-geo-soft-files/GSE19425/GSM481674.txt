Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481674/suppl/GSM481674_JA924.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2569	2140	2552.7472	2123.8058	1.5018372	1.247257	-0.2680	-0.0956374808925	0.83048752	1652	1466	1631.0781	1477.0427	0.9591965	0.8516428	-0.1716	-0.109349091413	0.8878713	2060	1739	2038.5677	1738.2742	1.2686133	1.0834222	-0.2277	-0.011362425374	0.85402094	2654	2121	2638.4385	2105.2766	2.0554041	1.6280884	-0.3362	-0.14791623421	0.79210145	6732	5247	6738.9379	5111.9597	4.6307669	3.4758737	-0.4139	-0.206858069015	0.75060436	4302	4476	4288.4795	4371.4818	2.7631743	2.8124826	0.0255	0.154876487918	1.01784487	642	629	619.9805	660.1804	0.7691149	0.847076	0.1393	0.260221535952	1.10136478	838	848	817.4651	872.7015	0.7359593	0.7853586	0.0937	0.0170563163316	1.06712239	2604	2597	2588.0013	2562.0627	1.4102761	1.3829473	-0.0282	-0.114133986922	0.980621710	2900	3353	2885.9734	3293.7939	2.7240261	3.0749575	0.1748	-0.108738888304	1.128828211	8865	7387	8888.9448	7182.6599	9.0920859	7.4206184	-0.2931	-0.0726558117341	0.816162412	1194	989	1171.8825	1013.2826	1.4528565	1.2833582	-0.1790	-0.0745525406496	0.883334413	2184	2307	2163.6514	2286.5903	2.4291412	2.5793296	0.0865	-0.0503664777865	1.061827814	5298	5138	5287.6827	5006.4874	3.0861349	2.6879994	-0.1993	-0.158643303091	0.870992215	1626	1415	1604.8185	1428.1251	1.6880208	1.4673124	-0.2022	-0.120488838177	0.869250216	800	788	778.7515	813.933	1.0450284	1.1064029	0.0823	-0.0832856495771	1.0587317	1332	1332	1309.6185	1347.5421	0.7590045	0.763105	0.0078	-0.0157600009374	1.005402518	1966	2522	1945.0906	2490.9889	1.3019401	1.6161136	0.3119	0.113165189338	1.241311819	2064	2009	2042.599	1996.4366	1.3848125	1.3062306	-0.0843	-0.145357436191	0.943254520	723	613	700.9288	644.4887	0.5045665	0.4667923	-0.1123	-0.0138179189079	0.9251352!sample_table_end
