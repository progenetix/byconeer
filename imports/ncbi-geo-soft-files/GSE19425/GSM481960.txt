Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481960/suppl/GSM481960_MR388.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	8098	4649	7089.3588	5068.653	1.734636	1.2220156	-0.5054	-0.245637862717	0.70447962	6514	4962	5795.4991	5404.1273	1.5135277	1.3897164	-0.1231	-0.14269549889	0.91819693	5170	3261	4674.4967	3576.1263	1.040018	0.8017774	-0.3753	-0.103376536885	0.77092654	12067	7363	10389.573	8044.0517	2.4346961	1.9180608	-0.3441	-0.242117743528	0.7878035	20569	14092	17535.123	15377.728	4.0772013	3.544392	-0.2020	-0.181767509499	0.86931986	10790	6875	9338.7414	7503.1024	2.1838287	1.7342781	-0.3325	-0.197889917782	0.79414567	3108	2841	2854.5863	3135.5683	0.7327026	0.7781198	0.0868	-0.0374315956773	1.06198598	4115	2390	3759.5757	2671.1695	0.9291753	0.6745032	-0.4621	-0.240732454358	0.7259169	9228	7513	8018.577	8209.3036	2.0033426	1.9816227	-0.0157	-0.139947103772	0.989158210	10940	6055	9462.2054	6588.5208	3.2978052	2.3170617	-0.5092	-0.292031284253	0.702607211	15031	10094	12874.367	11023.588	4.1029523	3.5776907	-0.1976	-0.158268131122	0.871979612	8833	6131	7689.1466	6669.5545	2.0993608	1.8201182	-0.2059	-0.0973023850011	0.866986813	4811	4191	4376.1077	4561.8204	1.6842756	1.6325367	-0.0450	-0.105505964313	0.969281214	13570	11799	11643.418	12890.093	2.8535884	2.9487028	0.0473	-0.137923779984	1.033331515	4512	3444	4116.8813	3771.9981	1.138161	1.0212218	-0.1564	-0.216219832669	0.89725616	4394	3145	4013.4029	3450.9546	1.0247903	0.8837959	-0.2135	-0.230875444039	0.862416417	2336	1749	2142.7873	1997.2812	0.5743141	0.5327528	-0.1084	0.00465944183028	0.927633118	8791	5027	7654.6421	5473.7824	1.6102103	1.0864665	-0.5676	-0.600367601963	0.674735819	3738	2338	3422.0261	2616.9138	0.9793779	0.7359313	-0.4123	-0.205991485539	0.751427320	4072	2700	3719.8315	2990.8277	1.1199501	0.9274025	-0.2722	-0.338590650051	0.8280749!sample_table_end
