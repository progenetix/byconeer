Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9775!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481625/suppl/GSM481625_JA682.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	663	1279	950.872	953.4859	0.5584316	0.5314255	0.0715	0.103980572158	1.05081832	1284	1708	1707.2699	1262.6667	0.7490089	0.7406044	0.0163	0.172999216659	1.01134823	3214	3504	3886.3823	2607.2323	1.4395318	1.3219174	0.1230	0.222837939208	1.08897264	5175	7345	5947.3471	5712.8517	3.8139568	3.4948439	0.1261	0.0591427344284	1.09130965	12242	12461	12474.695	10131.811	5.4218834	5.7993259	-0.0971	-0.119518241154	0.93491616	2542	4410	3163.9454	3318.8519	2.3240128	2.349329	-0.0156	0.134246704289	0.9892247	993	1643	1356.8041	1215.1543	1.0310463	0.855453	0.2693	0.246569465476	1.20526358	888	1923	1226.4363	1419.1995	0.9103606	0.9966467	-0.1306	0.144687149461	0.91342359	2529	2686	3149.8646	1991.2921	1.3066957	0.9869737	0.4048	0.124973100504	1.323941710	4212	8377	4960.3641	6579.8869	4.3666135	4.3962724	-0.0098	-0.00556160527517	0.993253611	1134	3407	1526.1427	2537.2551	1.5468696	1.8172256	-0.2324	-0.282467640344	0.851225912	5325	6895	6095.1467	5335.1244	3.1487778	2.8168221	0.1607	0.0918046182223	1.117847613	734	1810	1039.8262	1336.5385	1.1530295	1.0354291	0.1552	0.157902214031	1.113576514	8646	7381	9279.1987	5742.9941	4.8658261	3.1830869	0.6123	0.0626547472819	1.528650115	626	1109	903.8531	828.1983	0.4907311	0.4491981	0.1276	0.231082997996	1.092460416	2835	3768	3480.4629	2809.9749	1.9361621	1.7240146	0.1674	0.0592342633794	1.123054317	321	561	475.1106	442.0055	0.2441395	0.2443459	-0.0012	0.0584615544884	0.999155118	2031	2994	2585.4826	2228.193	0.9863677	1.1767427	-0.2546	0.14227043569	0.838218619	892	1228	1231.2652	915.8629	0.4805149	0.4509171	0.0917	0.105594275795	1.06563920	2470	2841	3085.6519	2110.0313	1.1384528	1.0326645	0.1407	0.0174943794593	1.102442!sample_table_end
