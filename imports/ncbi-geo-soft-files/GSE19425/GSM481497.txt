Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481497/suppl/GSM481497_DE406.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2906	2386	2212.5035	3023.4057	1.594269	1.8383488	-0.2055	0.0178072002759	0.86722882	934	624	751.4692	825.8621	0.6264025	0.6434215	-0.0387	-0.115264290143	0.97354923	4298	2498	3128.0269	3166.6954	1.4434191	1.4652408	-0.0216	0.192637070963	0.98510714	4512	2213	3261.9463	2809.1791	1.9698916	1.5695584	0.3278	0.17345317068	1.2550615	13232	6222	9008.6356	7857.6515	2.9476972	3.2852895	-0.1564	-0.0869131087713	0.89724126	9960	6503	6849.4294	8225.2511	3.3293117	4.0195883	-0.2718	-0.0924229679916	0.82827187	3741	1783	2767.6347	2284.3137	1.1578731	1.1841468	-0.0324	-0.0422667058654	0.97781218	1202	886	968.2434	1137.5489	0.6973124	0.7326956	-0.0714	-0.211996956286	0.95170839	3881	1880	2860.4822	2404.0915	1.8974328	1.7652575	0.1042	0.135326560291	1.07487610	5128	5160	3667.1375	6496.5343	3.8491711	5.7290613	-0.5738	0.107185148122	0.671867711	7610	7219	5278.7646	9165.9077	4.8485596	7.2663337	-0.5837	0.232242253142	0.667263612	3168	1452	2388.9069	1842.9259	1.5070873	1.2508433	0.2689	0.230095514437	1.20485713	1589	1655	1263.5491	2116.9508	1.6008771	2.7821554	-0.7973	-0.0361156170968	0.57540914	3180	2230	2396.5569	2829.5234	1.7431625	2.0709391	-0.2486	0.0833778686622	0.841725615	2077	1417	1618.5146	1797.248	1.2034258	1.3077432	-0.1199	0.14004135166	0.92023116	7908	2524	5476.8162	3200.0628	2.6701871	1.8291825	0.5457	0.423891684429	1.459770717	984	804	793.2212	1037.2421	0.7521995	0.7673262	-0.0287	-0.0926217712492	0.980286518	8066	4416	5581.7591	5560.3797	1.8763333	2.3432182	-0.3206	0.0445233790434	0.800750619	1810	1957	1429.0331	2498.3987	1.411898	1.9903087	-0.4954	-0.0684302906582	0.709386420	1077	651	866.5495	857.4493	1.162064	0.8413067	0.4660	0.162320522669	1.3812608!sample_table_end
