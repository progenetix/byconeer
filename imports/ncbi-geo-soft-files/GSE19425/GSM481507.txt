Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481507/suppl/GSM481507_DE426.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4492	3998	4516.2347	3926.6775	1.0823795	0.9388388	0.2053	0.0155506632497	1.15289162	3280	3566	3334.8647	3500.1216	0.8423841	0.8560212	-0.0232	-0.0151683774146	0.98406923	6529	4859	6472.7065	4792.8806	1.5912488	1.1647141	0.4502	0.232595312203	1.3662144	8385	10612	8192.9885	10705.572	2.292865	3.0050241	-0.3902	-0.276252365037	0.76301055	13652	16538	12888.655	17165.029	3.4546545	4.1714868	-0.2720	-0.304444084569	0.8281596	10835	15448	10417.711	15936.156	2.6764105	4.0851593	-0.6101	-0.558285325284	0.65515457	2054	3130	2137.7896	3066.5513	0.8910031	1.2420786	-0.4793	-0.425349001226	0.71734848	2046	2352	2129.7385	2292.5764	0.6398074	0.7061552	-0.1423	-0.141284655063	0.90604369	6046	5772	6012.072	5693.8148	1.4563157	1.3199936	0.1418	0.0671721057867	1.103274810	13507	12562	12762.44	12775.555	5.2852474	5.4120077	-0.0342	-0.298554971662	0.976577911	17919	17967	16634.6	18770.399	6.494818	7.4719134	-0.2022	-0.437438892928	0.869230912	7040	8669	6942.5251	8673.0931	2.3025518	2.9055839	-0.3356	-0.195595295771	0.792457513	5795	5150	5763.9981	5084.1934	2.1202142	1.871127	0.1803	-0.0610003890328	1.133121414	13997	15525	13191.494	16022.623	2.9952748	3.4034562	-0.1843	-0.180866734563	0.880068515	4432	3729	4459.3769	3660.1567	1.5804908	1.3052484	0.2760	-0.070613710387	1.210873516	4063	3693	4096.5626	3625.0225	1.3931016	1.2103252	0.2029	-0.0144602531478	1.151014217	3624	3222	3663.7188	3158.5098	0.8688306	0.7414454	0.2287	0.00381650235591	1.171806518	7407	9354	7282.2013	9387.5135	1.837977	2.2243631	-0.2753	-0.416071339401	0.826293519	6100	5054	6064.2952	4988.3341	1.5404573	1.2478808	0.3039	0.0602993662355	1.234458620	2747	2144	2825.7441	2082.9323	1.0446828	0.8060395	0.3741	0.0775585795948	1.296069!sample_table_end
