Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481611/suppl/GSM481611_EL677.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3726	2798	3821.6221	2682.4925	1.4665871	1.1328722	0.3725	0.134956756598	1.29457412	1555	1136	1599.5119	1129.9419	0.9039057	0.6955923	0.3779	0.168211087994	1.29947613	1744	1562	1796.1839	1525.8691	0.5501719	0.5044982	0.1250	-0.0824957736807	1.09053294	21582	16451	21056.601	15750.69	7.3777796	6.0457306	0.2873	0.00530009157644	1.22032885	19058	29803	18715.827	28954.375	6.6858713	10.527814	-0.6550	-0.0543826189591	0.63506736	15757	15569	15612.818	14897.429	5.3199965	5.5871937	-0.0707	-0.0925058762646	0.95217687	1240	2112	1269.3857	2035.2042	0.8934231	1.2535594	-0.4886	-0.197976052659	0.7127098	1749	1868	1801.0931	1809.28	0.7444754	0.7561238	-0.0224	0.0305592638645	0.98459469	3088	2897	3172.838	2776.1613	1.8221602	1.7143445	0.0880	-0.0517724476821	1.062890310	11755	13342	11782.184	12743.199	6.9050198	7.1121292	-0.0426	-0.0601795078003	0.970879411	4978	6307	5101.2699	6003.4664	2.5447206	2.9209486	-0.1989	-0.321572766793	0.871196612	4368	4921	4479.6192	4691.3513	2.9144367	2.7725528	0.0720	-0.101767372489	1.051174413	801	712	796.032	742.8691	0.6797531	0.5629346	0.2720	0.141483670211	1.207516814	4450	4655	4564.1528	4436.0985	2.8890892	2.9378869	-0.0242	-0.0312675619304	0.983390115	844	922	842.1885	933.9507	0.5200733	0.5105595	0.0266	-0.00332307597926	1.01863416	991	944	1000.394	954.1958	0.6840287	0.5793768	0.2396	0.196671875792	1.180628417	428	267	363.9457	335.6557	0.2037495	0.2056394	-0.0133	-0.0230725658344	0.990809418	5851	5516	5959.4801	5258.6811	2.3832502	2.2310158	0.0952	-0.0417564375627	1.068235419	1193	1094	1219.6427	1091.7746	0.740641	0.7217837	0.0372	-0.00302904292134	1.026125920	1692	1576	1745.0809	1538.8489	0.9912491	0.8836898	0.1657	-0.121387363787	1.1217161!sample_table_end
