Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481672/suppl/GSM481672_JA922.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5102	3832	4890.6196	3823.0584	1.5225037	1.2269432	-0.3114	-0.0922366647978	0.80587212	2916	2359	2803.2433	2386.9256	0.8214254	0.7083584	-0.2137	-0.243882469728	0.86235273	3291	2627	3155.0567	2651.1647	1.2110671	1.0224553	-0.2442	-0.109458036169	0.84425994	5175	3842	4960.7852	3832.8018	2.151513	1.6493298	-0.3835	-0.284552708569	0.76659075	9124	6674	8788.7626	6575.9223	4.2011613	3.1817603	-0.4010	-0.306469758396	0.75735266	7569	10214	7254.8069	9960.6065	2.754743	3.7933372	0.4615	0.566628334213	1.37702047	1022	2016	1023.3586	2050.967	0.8095052	1.6161908	0.9975	0.940536484167	1.99651688	1516	2613	1493.6436	2637.3581	0.7804555	1.3586908	0.7998	0.713208119091	1.74089479	5145	6257	4931.9536	6174.4799	1.3467497	1.7307134	0.3619	0.1909547463	1.28510410	3105	3456	2979.2698	3451.8071	2.1440364	2.3977789	0.1614	-0.0198691034687	1.11834811	11995	9484	11666.838	9265.2273	7.9330507	6.3814239	-0.3140	-0.0960456702668	0.804409812	1578	1010	1554.0274	1048.7024	1.3539652	0.9044148	-0.5821	-0.598196420397	0.66797513	1552	1611	1528.7079	1645.677	1.6692583	1.7149214	0.0389	-0.109595878639	1.027355314	11245	9341	10919.542	9128.3187	3.0174371	2.514194	-0.2632	-0.184839848369	0.833221715	2126	2315	2076.6636	2343.3123	1.6148337	1.7867028	0.1459	0.0899180170431	1.106431516	1321	1258	1309.6785	1295.0747	1.0690422	1.0565084	-0.0170	-0.137255326534	0.988275617	2911	2628	2798.7076	2652.1522	0.8142247	0.7865347	-0.0499	-0.00618613194653	0.965992118	4206	4029	4024.9708	4014.938	1.4237661	1.4330704	0.0094	-0.00948015505241	1.00653519	4686	4287	4487.2385	4269.2678	1.4121939	1.3822296	-0.0309	-0.0554072443901	0.978781820	957	679	958.28	719.4115	0.5327943	0.3827307	-0.4772	-0.388577599667	0.7183461!sample_table_end
