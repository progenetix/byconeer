Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481662/suppl/GSM481662_JA912.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1004	795	1053.72	781.3589	0.9305525	0.6730414	-0.4674	-0.195186474803	0.72327082	776	650	818.247	648.3385	0.9669011	0.6954938	-0.4753	-0.42834992321	0.71930183	1479	1375	1545.9712	1308.2036	0.8858558	0.7629989	-0.2154	-0.00160528506931	0.86131274	4277	2252	4230.9086	2120.9266	2.7164287	1.3647816	-0.9930	-0.789370997318	0.50241765	11295	4757	10745.801	4450.6799	5.2138274	2.3093127	-1.1749	-0.869405613799	0.44292086	5813	5766	5658.116	5391.1039	3.5473562	3.3651975	-0.0761	0.0125792568033	0.94864947	1088	1660	1143.6288	1570.6111	1.0910879	1.5423714	0.4994	0.473212212374	1.41360868	1504	1552	1571.2875	1469.551	1.0152066	0.9526353	-0.0918	-0.135291768026	0.93836599	951	1076	1000.4809	1038.9816	1.1213858	1.0529816	-0.0908	-0.127715852792	0.939000210	3213	3287	3221.838	3062.7957	2.1227892	1.983029	-0.0983	-0.273118503088	0.93416211	9603	5638	9176.9546	5273.8736	5.7761063	3.4392597	-0.7480	-0.383564627307	0.595428712	2814	1981	2848.4499	1869.3609	1.8884578	1.2431219	-0.6032	-0.505660502414	0.658273613	1317	2344	1374.6927	2205.563	0.9450969	1.2550862	0.4093	0.0886351231566	1.327997314	2826	2203	2859.5289	2075.9914	3.3801023	2.2145392	-0.6101	-0.493171724663	0.655169315	1942	2074	2004.3594	1957.6662	1.0681628	1.0515259	-0.0226	0.0411476406338	0.984424716	1053	1128	1106.1937	1083.9909	0.8291558	0.8304552	0.0023	-0.0674864014804	1.001567217	620	595	653.8682	598.6586	0.7237504	0.6044879	-0.2598	-0.141557830081	0.83521618	1872	2494	1934.7138	2344.1561	1.1538964	1.3324337	0.2075	0.079663737314	1.154725519	931	1002	980.6785	972.2643	1.0975736	0.9811704	-0.1617	-0.131510785231	0.89394520	646	571	681.5848	577.3072	0.4973537	0.4022907	-0.3060	-0.102502987304	0.8088624!sample_table_end
