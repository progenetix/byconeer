Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481733/suppl/GSM481733_JBH405.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3833	3738	3864.1045	3678.3143	1.0917231	1.1252611	-0.0437	-0.0806881271465	0.97019542	2466	3396	2470.2289	3357.0673	1.1056853	1.290589	-0.2231	-0.152423892771	0.85672923	4597	3763	4650.2462	3701.4972	1.192341	1.0289354	0.2126	0.0016604517044	1.15881034	12856	15677	12912.288	14890.724	4.0011702	4.4930572	-0.1673	-0.264766979896	0.89052295	20732	23436	20381.449	22172.16	5.2158054	6.2369192	-0.2579	-0.356616242084	0.83627916	13204	14887	13243.971	14152.3	3.6369501	4.3266587	-0.2505	-0.276999805112	0.8405917	3506	3629	3534.3047	3575.8841	0.9422835	1.0313603	-0.1303	-0.159980916671	0.91363178	3267	3266	3290.4314	3235.1359	0.9677347	0.9168302	0.0780	-0.0648242477903	1.05552239	2080	3354	2081.3259	3317.6431	0.9252709	1.2042545	-0.3802	-0.218589185548	0.76833510	12736	14107	12798.945	13424.389	3.5858327	4.0650233	-0.1810	-0.0768085340615	0.882118611	10347	14808	10457.039	14078.464	2.7971589	3.9463757	-0.4966	-0.295341180715	0.708791812	9274	11630	9399.0516	11104.91	2.1101306	2.7773737	-0.3964	-0.14703102296	0.759757513	3079	3341	3096.3111	3305.44	1.1972412	1.1949339	0.0028	0.035675564326	1.001930914	5335	7620	5405.2303	7328.6432	3.0281164	3.4170617	-0.1743	-0.137339994879	0.886175515	2675	2441	2684.4644	2438.933	0.5805955	0.5614817	0.0483	0.0390049998776	1.034041716	3096	3159	3113.8743	3134.5996	0.8222301	0.853145	-0.0532	-0.00720783383053	0.963763617	1074	976	1051.7808	1031.4375	0.434239	0.3844566	0.1757	0.101424175122	1.129487618	3470	4882	3497.8258	4754.4893	1.5054973	1.7633668	-0.2281	-0.0922420322326	0.85376319	3226	2951	3248.1757	2934.8195	0.9972403	0.9461573	0.0759	0.0710820673665	1.0539920	2671	2312	2680.3023	2314.2743	0.8271559	0.7859719	0.0737	-0.0886367265979	1.0523988!sample_table_end
