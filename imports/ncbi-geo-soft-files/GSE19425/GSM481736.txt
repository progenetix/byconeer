Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481736/suppl/GSM481736_JBH408.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2004	2119	2023.8979	2107.4993	1.0237999	0.9956513	-0.0402	-0.0230960945734	0.97250572	3530	3796	3553.9896	3725.3484	1.959117	1.7770724	-0.1407	-0.12815758133	0.90707823	2197	2659	2216.3577	2626.2781	0.967607	1.0924337	0.1751	0.169597183888	1.12900564	11931	13134	11655.795	12822.512	4.3428618	4.751933	0.1299	0.107181665692	1.09419395	14202	15292	13760.405	14931.651	6.1923742	6.5277637	0.0761	0.0791727311444	1.05416176	5887	7599	5890.1175	7440.2057	3.0212386	3.5387074	0.2281	0.144855618559	1.1712777	3685	4074	3712.5945	3990.3894	1.0682224	1.1762264	0.1390	0.0900837878397	1.10110638	3267	3513	3286.7463	3453.4238	0.8974893	1.0045953	0.1626	0.0956405101775	1.11933969	2461	2824	2479.4253	2789.702	1.2475719	1.2339907	-0.0158	-0.0152639196116	0.989113910	12083	10926	11797.464	10674.661	3.402522	3.4117022	0.0039	-0.000753312304401	1.002698111	15837	15693	15257.869	15320.523	4.0136636	4.6033717	0.1978	0.140195440491	1.146925112	13398	12776	13010.868	12473.47	3.5867771	3.7672524	0.0708	0.0830206555807	1.050316913	4790	4595	4793.9183	4493.1094	1.4549399	1.3665939	-0.0904	0.0421778372871	0.939278614	5949	7608	5950.8306	7449.1373	3.876926	4.2012678	0.1159	-0.047728273264	1.083659515	2979	3326	3003.3009	3272.9616	0.7517304	0.8310723	0.1448	0.0901514190225	1.105545716	4009	4017	4033.5898	3935.649	0.9336127	1.014582	0.1200	0.0541692956292	1.086726817	766	910	751.7667	946.8556	0.408634	0.4498974	0.1388	0.0548375048328	1.100978718	2450	3622	2468.558	3558.5783	1.4805938	1.7374256	0.2308	0.16071667382	1.173465419	1268	1478	1275.8454	1491.6002	0.6701535	0.7138754	0.0912	-0.0581778691403	1.065241620	2780	2366	2800.439	2344.6279	0.8246656	0.7731434	-0.0931	0.00295622519875	0.9375234!sample_table_end
