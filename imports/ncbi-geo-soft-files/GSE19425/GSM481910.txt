Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481910/suppl/GSM481910_MR324.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5556	4072	5288.187	4268.1442	1.5316829	1.2159668	-0.3330	0.208391400867	0.79387632	4065	5014	3849.3188	5221.7251	1.4440159	1.9598913	0.4407	0.196792341715	1.35725053	3001	2942	2822.2753	3121.4143	0.8262462	0.9022176	0.1269	0.0825252045877	1.09194764	15551	16999	14798.365	17361.238	4.0570065	4.7167854	0.2174	-0.0664904640319	1.1626275	21172	18717	19978.585	19130.191	6.1676253	5.8362973	-0.0797	-0.102056547136	0.94627946	12546	10652	11981.887	10917.615	3.9490739	3.5074054	-0.1711	0.0345163394065	0.88815897	2913	2783	2737.9968	2958.2466	1.161383	1.1566243	-0.0059	0.0685410826469	0.99590268	3986	4086	3771.401	4282.3982	1.039994	1.1788078	0.1808	0.145414779278	1.13347569	2920	2474	2744.9343	2639.8996	0.9960615	0.9707281	-0.0372	0.0770916105718	0.974566310	13066	12310	12474.124	12589.513	4.0480245	4.0850509	0.0131	-0.101766381681	1.009146711	12122	9871	11579.303	10122.221	3.5072752	3.0931267	-0.1813	-0.308239273819	0.881917312	8496	12540	8120.1492	12823.38	3.0481965	4.554094	0.5792	-0.166120958073	1.49402913	3397	3368	3200.429	3560.7747	1.3947916	1.5072403	0.1119	0.0502918862966	1.080620414	7894	9432	7536.2338	9680.5093	3.9419835	4.8958096	0.3126	0.00563568653206	1.24196615	2552	2667	2385.178	2839.7785	0.7648616	0.8762428	0.1961	0.0259552247163	1.145622716	1930	2774	1794.8603	2949.075	0.6668169	1.0295254	0.6266	-0.102422290453	1.543940317	1665	1283	1546.0627	1401.3978	0.5493983	0.4976823	-0.1426	0.219818047882	0.90586818	4628	4372	4395.6492	4574.3103	2.0043135	1.8954611	-0.0806	0.0703845188999	0.945690919	2372	1965	2215.6201	2110.625	0.7649217	0.7393943	-0.0490	0.0179323096129	0.966627320	3091	2609	2908.0744	2780.1898	0.748888	0.7643363	0.0295	-0.142518737499	1.0206283!sample_table_end
