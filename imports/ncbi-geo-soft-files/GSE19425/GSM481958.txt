Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481958/suppl/GSM481958_MR384.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	7973	3975	6639.3404	4623.2194	1.6431763	1.1257088	-0.5457	-0.214656742546	0.68508092	7341	4179	6139.5604	4852.0699	1.6595116	1.2638158	-0.3930	-0.210322874357	0.76155893	3474	2129	2990.0206	2496.854	0.8542525	0.7148142	-0.2571	-0.0274451749825	0.83677154	13528	7709	11053.633	8901.8649	2.9140424	2.5115127	-0.2145	-0.152946010364	0.86186555	14511	10417	11833.353	11948.51	4.4427265	4.2814693	-0.0533	0.0562105989905	0.96370316	8728	5578	7231.4386	6499.6452	2.1789755	1.9544153	-0.1569	0.0323502773322	0.89694237	2073	1764	1832.8319	2071.8764	0.6479136	0.6433262	-0.0103	-0.0518163236098	0.99291968	3945	2103	3379.4597	2467.6106	0.9136852	0.7137972	-0.3562	-0.558414388023	0.78122879	6761	4594	5660.2856	5334.1985	1.4582193	1.3344036	-0.1280	-0.243312932066	0.915091110	15423	9599	12557.365	11035.937	3.8168646	3.4819198	-0.1325	-0.0562425294114	0.912246111	17536	10993	14248.465	12591.266	4.1126821	3.7302124	-0.1408	-0.10863565994	0.907002312	9479	7256	7830.5041	8396.0028	2.1355436	2.2382189	0.0677	0.0772886721568	1.048079213	6693	4133	5604.1452	4800.5475	1.5619044	1.2897608	-0.2762	-0.174517724445	0.825761614	11560	8526	9477.6759	9823.6197	3.1100506	2.9793994	-0.0619	-0.111298266253	0.957990615	4719	3104	4011.1912	3630.2672	1.0534103	0.9337399	-0.1740	-0.204722720851	0.886397116	3543	3051	3048.1183	3568.6005	0.8542456	0.9437791	0.1438	-0.121311990576	1.104809917	1770	1302	1573.9331	1546.2072	0.4244865	0.409302	-0.0526	0.209564534646	0.964228518	5399	3292	4562.4817	3846.1484	1.5409495	1.2241199	-0.3321	-0.225098739335	0.794393219	4430	2562	3779.5671	2995.9347	0.9508485	0.7537391	-0.3352	-0.128058472288	0.792701520	5819	3676	4900.0126	4282.1817	1.0764002	1.0071406	-0.0959	-0.102432017204	0.9356563!sample_table_end
