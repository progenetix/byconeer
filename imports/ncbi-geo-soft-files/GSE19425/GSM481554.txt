Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481554/suppl/GSM481554_EL176.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2997	2233	2781.1074	2350.1416	1.8712731	1.5116591	-0.3079	-0.000780492696633	0.80782392	1218	889	1095.1005	1002.6673	0.6978599	0.6113354	-0.1910	-0.146512015372	0.87601453	3508	2580	3263.2188	2700.7871	2.0116918	1.567115	-0.3603	-0.222168070849	0.77900354	6324	5401	5863.535	5556.6318	3.5669987	3.2799717	-0.1210	0.00528499874843	0.91953265	20213	13576	18079.778	13743.395	14.274789	10.083764	-0.5014	-0.363596103452	0.70640376	6691	6970	6194.5804	7134.4347	4.3863791	4.7056095	0.1014	0.0442854147496	1.07277777	1656	1596	1521.3124	1706.6065	1.0028994	1.059944	0.0798	-0.0318925220077	1.05687978	2043	1278	1891.5876	1388.8539	1.5422391	1.1856337	-0.3794	-0.353182259143	0.76877429	6081	5735	5641.1979	5893.9329	3.2210985	3.2636993	0.0190	-0.00859237499654	1.013225610	11005	9062	10049.562	9234.9693	9.4404882	9.7977108	0.0536	-0.0100843267993	1.037839411	12222	8833	11123.83	9005.9641	10.670011	9.5483372	-0.1602	-0.225763701263	0.89487612	2390	1336	2220.4758	1447.2073	2.2702224	1.5888126	-0.5149	-0.300307018715	0.699848913	1607	1084	1473.9632	1193.9039	1.9584284	1.7053765	-0.1996	-0.351717595273	0.870788314	12241	8720	11140.678	8892.7349	9.4953126	7.3346183	-0.3725	-0.296533745812	0.772446215	1046	884	930.0803	997.9399	0.8982713	1.0555209	0.2327	0.0805627083766	1.17505816	2312	2135	2146.6623	2251.3654	1.9937707	2.231481	0.1625	-0.108334277248	1.119226517	837	559	714.2468	661.4118	0.4592764	0.4151916	-0.1456	-0.141837710291	0.904012418	2510	2016	2333.1373	2130.5571	2.1701878	1.8898926	-0.1995	-0.204106140526	0.870842919	2919	2599	2709.1348	2719.965	1.744305	1.7274196	-0.0140	-0.0452719674039	0.990319720	2821	2101	2618.9511	2216.9369	1.6738702	1.514621	-0.1442	-0.108303748984	0.9048617!sample_table_end
