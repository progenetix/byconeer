Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481763/suppl/GSM481763_JBH535.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1681	2091	1881.8811	1861.5474	0.9225669	0.8572104	0.1060	-0.00213531097984	1.07624322	2426	2682	2686.3787	2384.4423	1.4429327	1.1419993	0.3374	0.179553470615	1.26351453	983	1227	1119.5545	1092.7918	0.5406167	0.5226253	0.0488	0.0711850638661	1.03442494	9198	8606	9666.6343	7800.2511	4.5040505	3.7042552	0.2820	0.0226743243081	1.21591255	12158	14942	12615.365	13731.355	6.5072535	7.1783135	-0.1416	-0.0488677927794	0.90651566	6062	7297	6481.9971	6586.7806	3.3979944	3.4152542	-0.0073	-0.0155051141677	0.99494627	1777	1961	1984.4626	1743.1249	1.1925135	1.1299387	0.0778	0.0106548236326	1.05537888	1690	1819	1891.4036	1614.4902	0.8735633	0.8023598	0.1227	-0.00321743348379	1.08874269	2665	3329	2943.1214	2964.1219	1.5097561	1.3337253	0.1789	0.102473239575	1.131984310	6113	6981	6533.2473	6292.2508	3.2278038	3.3294993	-0.0448	0.0135761701526	0.969456211	8265	8391	8725.2344	7598.971	4.2764141	3.9840011	0.1022	0.1358478028	1.073396812	3256	3249	3573.0241	2891.9051	2.0710152	1.8424597	0.1687	-0.0350096533232	1.124049113	1050	1584	1193.4656	1407.9686	0.6349803	0.8276114	-0.3822	-0.0657120831972	0.767244514	5218	6503	5624.2499	5851.5192	3.6318994	3.0453168	0.2541	-0.0572527304888	1.192617915	1096	1344	1243.7087	1193.1925	0.6609286	0.6980902	-0.0789	0.0206003393699	0.946766716	949	1373	1081.5926	1219.4886	0.5979789	0.7578147	-0.3418	0.0355395975765	0.789083217	540	880	626.696	793.6779	0.3386294	0.3909753	-0.2074	-0.0178811264702	0.866114518	2285	3580	2534.9864	3194.4798	1.3668217	1.5127459	-0.1463	-0.0697585276659	0.903536819	770	1230	886.1107	1095.2786	0.4907735	0.5477875	-0.1586	0.0285195056603	0.895919520	1652	1612	1851.1802	1432.6403	0.8564099	0.679765	0.3333	0.0828992946769	1.2598617!sample_table_end
