Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481468/suppl/GSM481468_DE363.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3785	1586	3286.1727	1813.3394	2.1594929	1.1819621	-0.8695	-0.323703431172	0.54733312	1015	923	847.6662	1110.2675	0.923026	0.9861032	0.0954	0.109604877426	1.06833743	5216	2250	4515.9719	2508.7692	2.2445799	1.4208109	-0.6597	-0.199963447621	0.63299634	4543	3162	3946.4509	3426.6569	2.2685947	2.2187546	-0.0320	0.0783052791391	0.97803045	10869	7680	9040.1089	8251.6814	4.7899884	4.9818432	0.0567	-0.0546311927384	1.04005326	8122	5908	6886.823	6300.2129	3.4899491	3.5732548	0.0340	-0.0288259704431	1.02387017	1944	1670	1678.0135	1901.7612	1.4293597	1.3711253	-0.0600	0.0165945881147	0.95925838	1461	974	1242.711	1165.1077	0.6357957	0.6424951	0.0151	-0.0536815663304	1.0105379	992	924	827.2771	1111.3587	0.8763874	0.9856923	0.1696	0.0616979616553	1.12472210	6665	4738	5696.0687	5067.5703	3.3717391	2.8874331	-0.2237	-0.178522691883	0.856363111	15832	10193	12767.394	11107.642	6.7681903	6.2669231	-0.1110	-0.256442120112	0.925937712	2933	2687	2552.1095	2952.3731	1.669777	1.9121584	0.1955	0.217042191751	1.145157913	1872	1860	1614.023	2099.6323	1.5780002	1.5708825	-0.0065	-0.0470563511038	0.995489414	2968	2889	2583.0439	3154.6084	2.6722323	2.7770814	0.0555	-0.0168520157033	1.039236515	3689	1992	3204.4635	2238.0342	1.7438927	1.2042754	-0.5341	-0.216335193487	0.690567316	1795	1283	1545.8865	1495.15	1.1230191	0.972814	-0.2071	-0.134160648667	0.866248817	1829	696	1576.1614	866.9706	1.5232968	0.674995	-1.1742	-0.589821237564	0.443114518	2772	1551	2410.3565	1776.3255	1.6580296	1.2558318	-0.4008	-0.283366227237	0.757424219	2345	1260	2034.2379	1470.9118	1.9892834	1.1884023	-0.7432	-0.536385452361	0.597402220	1263	800	1071.9956	976.9572	0.6181693	0.5147747	-0.2641	0.0740026661366	0.8327406!sample_table_end
