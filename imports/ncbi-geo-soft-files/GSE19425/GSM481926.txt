Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481926/suppl/GSM481926_MR350.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4785	2871	4491.8626	3100.856	1.1618749	0.803422	-0.5322	-0.0316497078785	0.69148752	5013	4804	4709.4074	5012.5213	1.3476564	1.456521	0.1121	0.0983149835149	1.08078063	4875	3342	4577.7186	3561.1347	1.1710677	0.9280835	-0.3355	0.0837053157209	0.79251064	15724	15574	14993.237	15770.184	3.8122836	4.051091	0.0877	-0.18883376791	1.06264155	24859	21931	23542.389	22171.801	6.5800886	6.2861189	-0.0659	-0.232200168417	0.95532446	13527	12867	12921.49	13032.016	3.6282737	3.7273518	0.0389	-0.0350016123024	1.02730727	2751	2569	2523.3954	2790.9274	0.9955474	1.0329858	0.0533	0.0837039543485	1.03760598	4239	3240	3958.7771	3463.599	1.02238	0.912077	-0.1647	-0.0406596910083	0.89211169	7634	4871	7272.5197	5079.1485	1.9484619	1.3817693	-0.4958	-0.0598334299716	0.70915910	11158	10787	10658.151	10933.39	3.7743579	3.8777644	0.0390	0.0512914895361	1.027397111	13990	8463	13357.956	8631.2259	4.0410362	2.6757316	-0.5948	-0.385386279086	0.6621412	7867	9632	7499.504	9785.2837	2.5566187	3.2225306	0.3340	-0.227712297245	1.260465913	3394	2690	3141.7704	2917.2214	1.5564251	1.339705	-0.2163	-0.0359364002992	0.860757814	15457	14335	14741.769	14515.489	4.8119059	4.7597795	-0.0157	-0.220582993463	0.989167215	3504	2679	3245.6366	2905.7499	0.9991824	0.8675273	-0.2038	0.0129084444855	0.868237216	2725	2697	2498.239	2924.521	0.8238486	0.9338232	0.1808	-0.0926376010055	1.133488917	2297	1550	2099.0197	1727.6154	0.6072246	0.5056735	-0.2640	0.245055668058	0.832761818	6120	5359	5785.3825	5566.5078	1.7734894	1.67194	-0.0851	0.0279124350658	0.942740319	2813	1857	2583.4356	2054.482	0.7928073	0.6289339	-0.3341	0.0484249514839	0.793299920	3033	1964	2793.8714	2167.6509	0.97541	0.788545	-0.3068	-0.0890083361962	0.8084242!sample_table_end
