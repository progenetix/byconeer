Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481874/suppl/GSM481874_MR284.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2788	2950	2911.3974	2861.8492	0.6956832	0.6706138	-0.0529	0.0737643063571	0.96396432	5936	4520	5889.5109	4458.0544	1.4640663	1.0827655	-0.4353	-0.359808909199	0.73956043	5557	4298	5534.1874	4235.115	1.2089429	0.8953592	-0.4332	-0.140382464618	0.74061334	14199	8486	13308.556	8588.7908	2.7909287	1.8033496	-0.6301	-0.447290650511	0.64614675	17247	13538	16103.23	13807.202	3.8502967	3.1011934	-0.3121	-0.259289250846	0.80544276	9484	9333	9071.8651	9480.2433	2.212498	2.1866233	-0.0170	-0.0566820054741	0.98830527	3323	3745	3429.6647	3661.3541	0.8422844	0.8453927	0.0053	-0.0278012917049	1.00369038	4060	3560	4142.1369	3470.8537	0.7931254	0.7003704	-0.1794	-0.265001568404	0.88305139	6023	6576	5969.3604	6607.6246	1.4013394	1.4943421	0.0927	0.00880568375111	1.066366910	19312	16568	18054.381	16913.953	3.5299835	3.6750293	0.0581	0.0061829628116	1.041089611	28057	22032	26287.965	22513.547	5.1157709	4.8805453	-0.0679	-0.0610602442603	0.954019512	12778	9228	12029.838	9370.2151	2.7056544	2.1173343	-0.3537	-0.331155134415	0.78255913	7491	7245	7273.9139	7294.3511	1.6917598	1.7875078	0.0794	0.0396813909218	1.056596614	8520	8421	8202.4717	8519.872	3.0430407	2.5909505	-0.2320	-0.22013427746	0.851434715	4784	4927	4818.0863	4878.4382	1.0265023	1.0842036	0.0789	0.0327799140259	1.056211616	4870	4853	4898.4848	4801.4953	1.0509663	1.0182549	-0.0456	-0.137359417254	0.968874917	1895	2084	2022.9456	2015.722	0.4806316	0.4762075	-0.0133	0.0121537183373	0.990795318	4440	5654	4499.4899	5634.2514	1.5892033	1.5133806	-0.0705	-0.0815544712426	0.952288819	5144	5082	5151.7438	5037.4071	1.1074446	1.140782	0.0428	0.0423878510551	1.03010320	4426	3284	4486.6266	3192.689	0.7814487	0.6398059	-0.2885	-0.0493059085136	0.8187433!sample_table_end
