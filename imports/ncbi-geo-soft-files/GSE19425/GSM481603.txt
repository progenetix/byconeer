Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481603/suppl/GSM481603_EL669.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2285	2172	2343.2207	2105.4613	0.866392	0.808596	0.0996	0.0341283620171	1.07147692	1134	1527	1187.427	1480.4936	0.6322421	0.7653705	-0.2757	-0.468952272664	0.82606013	1872	1955	1933.0889	1896.583	0.582947	0.609365	-0.0639	-0.114249649281	0.95664654	13345	15393	13075.85	15126.214	4.2454658	5.4043571	-0.3482	-0.489760581047	0.78556355	12839	28550	12608.918	28595.221	4.1960957	9.6556734	-1.2023	-0.612232833334	0.4345736	9110	11807	9066.1741	11531.619	3.1084557	4.3342581	-0.4796	-0.450011209784	0.71718287	1362	3075	1421.9449	2992.5395	0.7090086	1.3593159	-0.9390	-0.543308577179	0.52159228	1766	2722	1828.1908	2645.318	0.6323873	0.9563366	-0.5967	-0.460677322934	0.66126019	1891	2487	1951.807	2410.4898	1.0231951	1.2189555	-0.2526	-0.45529204935	0.839403110	10613	12587	10508.133	12301.419	4.781098	5.6713081	-0.2463	-0.155725540444	0.843032611	7103	8608	7111.6439	8387.6476	2.7632451	3.3766478	-0.2892	-0.381289777687	0.818339712	4546	6361	4601.9858	6190.9364	1.9781011	2.5538216	-0.3685	-0.550780486231	0.774565113	886	1056	936.45376	1026.3846	0.5000162	0.4889712	0.0322	0.0893550945673	1.022588214	4785	6594	4841.3603	6416.6236	2.9274645	3.7005784	-0.3381	-0.285061522026	0.791082915	1320	1510	1379.8737	1463.946	0.5478851	0.5439904	0.0103	0.055634922021	1.007159616	1039	1698	1090.6917	1647.7641	0.5109849	0.7115303	-0.4776	-0.0358618860344	0.718149217	217	186	208.16524	201.22474	0.107052	0.1029565	0.0563	-0.04525408841	1.039778918	3767	4401	3816.1154	4284.22	1.5110875	1.7441928	-0.2070	-0.269030571247	0.866353419	941	972	992.03448	946.11855	0.5420916	0.5161278	0.0708	-0.0562956020945	1.050304920	1790	1716	1851.9995	1665.464	0.827734	0.7841793	0.0780	-0.121307235746	1.0555416!sample_table_end
