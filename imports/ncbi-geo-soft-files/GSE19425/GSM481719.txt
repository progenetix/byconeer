Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481719/suppl/GSM481719_JBH217.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3700	4658	4197.6231	4120.5696	0.996627	0.8858991	0.1699	-0.00433638458983	1.12498922	4456	5038	5017.0647	4469.2031	1.4323495	1.2632755	0.1812	0.0855399584682	1.13383783	4893	5073	5470.4686	4501.4428	1.0843707	0.8513499	0.3490	0.169284559192	1.27370734	13421	16027	14161.183	14701.377	2.9077052	2.8966943	0.0055	0.0074248788577	1.00380115	20152	27509	20778.463	25912.489	3.6585113	4.4499255	-0.2825	-0.274880476904	0.82215116	9908	13446	10679.569	12258.814	2.442951	2.6600943	-0.1229	-0.0605668777373	0.91837017	6172	6496	6811.3813	5807.04	1.0024427	0.9463596	0.0831	0.0570616193146	1.05926198	2852	3405	3280.1767	2994.8578	0.5958906	0.5472038	0.1230	0.0749288661825	1.08897379	3560	4660	4047.7822	4122.3973	1.116951	1.1189546	-0.0026	-0.0207880604457	0.998209410	20612	20747	21227.053	19288.93	3.6231526	3.4418375	0.0741	-0.0186307268667	1.052679711	21809	23509	22372.926	21969.969	3.8181035	3.7992076	0.0072	0.022070898033	1.004973612	8690	9296	9438.7005	8355.0509	1.4469624	1.4414038	0.0056	0.233473839282	1.003856313	6808	6506	7486.1915	5816.2237	1.2656539	1.052208	0.2665	0.0673282562481	1.202855314	6473	9165	7135.85	8233.8528	2.3767242	2.475162	-0.0585	-0.0303713751124	0.960229715	6204	6499	6845.9421	5809.793	1.0421529	0.9385607	0.1510	0.0653477217078	1.110373416	8831	8831	9581.9454	7926.6695	1.6091396	1.5390454	0.0643	0.0417036177149	1.045543917	1452	1454	1733.4949	1288.0735	0.4716524	0.3378121	0.4815	0.231914045637	1.396197518	5687	8961	6298.2665	8046.2	1.3045758	1.5064962	-0.2076	-0.126831493785	0.865966919	3882	4473	4392.766	3952.025	1.1226342	1.005203	0.1594	0.0298055211067	1.116823320	4664	5527	5236.2715	4918.7639	0.8637948	0.8191389	0.0766	0.0433653646547	1.0545157!sample_table_end
