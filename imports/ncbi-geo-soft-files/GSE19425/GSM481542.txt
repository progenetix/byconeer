Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481542/suppl/GSM481542_EL162.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1561	1262	1517.0327	1299.8497	0.9003301	0.7523117	-0.2591	-0.0438078744729	0.83559532	1807	1614	1753.5407	1655.9117	1.3154941	1.2191959	-0.1097	-0.086593740461	0.92679693	1676	1397	1628.4693	1436.6532	0.8215612	0.6820246	-0.2685	0.0729565509637	0.83015674	9451	7360	8845.0571	7601.2252	4.8170473	3.9063996	-0.3023	-0.294554328741	0.81095315	16404	15134	14930.213	16006.281	7.4379907	7.6829765	0.0468	-0.301639402196	1.03293716	8925	6881	8372.4232	7094.1336	4.5268764	3.6526895	-0.3096	-0.209060836015	0.80688967	1460	1634	1418.0651	1675.8881	0.8403301	0.9296555	0.1457	-0.118064594421	1.10629798	1760	1490	1708.9469	1531.4197	0.9398649	0.8195899	-0.1976	-0.248223487442	0.87202949	2572	2343	2489.0951	2396.3855	1.8148325	1.7318382	-0.0675	-0.225344556027	0.954268810	3822	3931	3675.9156	4026.3337	2.3479561	2.683318	0.1926	0.0231981402334	1.142831411	5761	3217	5478.9633	3292.1829	3.3009577	2.0320633	-0.6999	-0.636063367622	0.615598112	2170	1587	2101.7469	1628.9492	1.2305722	0.9483791	-0.3758	-0.163261764271	0.770681413	1818	1546	1763.9734	1587.9834	1.1920222	1.1277078	-0.0800	-0.00322548725875	0.94604614	3884	2817	3734.2551	2876.842	2.5887831	2.0603817	-0.3294	-0.270410216981	0.795888115	1578	1380	1533.5974	1419.2489	0.8195077	0.7817215	-0.0681	-0.00206737658185	0.953891616	1632	1680	1585.997	1721.8642	0.8098063	0.8490155	0.0682	0.0524714027574	1.04841817	777	696	758.1584	729.3203	0.5627644	0.5349861	-0.0730	0.0877501296047	0.950639518	2971	2183	2861.74	2233.1902	1.3967487	1.0681341	-0.3870	-0.140310417421	0.764728919	999	777	972.8913	810.8348	0.7761708	0.6409988	-0.2761	-0.0257586825948	0.825847520	2266	1714	2195.2983	1755.8266	1.1750054	0.9808359	-0.2606	0.0123894606986	0.8347501!sample_table_end
