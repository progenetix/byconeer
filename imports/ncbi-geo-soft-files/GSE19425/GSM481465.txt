Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481465/suppl/GSM481465_DE362.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3741	3693	3882.8036	3506.3491	1.4326047	1.3311502	0.1060	-0.0702893107539	1.07621562	1619	1735	1726.5085	1627.1521	0.7922583	0.7157498	0.1465	0.121394498039	1.10689293	4399	3771	4541.3539	3582.5608	1.5816668	1.3090919	0.2729	0.0121538613965	1.20821684	7022	5678	7128.1778	5463.6594	2.7804042	2.1869277	0.3464	0.298240577283	1.27137465	14261	11451	14092.192	11251.777	5.0656292	4.1987703	0.2708	0.263142844336	1.20645546	8602	9919	8680.0521	9705.107	3.1065748	3.6883038	-0.2476	-0.225707674358	0.84227737	1733	2386	1845.6952	2242.3572	1.025796	1.1389103	-0.1509	-0.159615323392	0.9006828	1632	1860	1740.0597	1744.3239	0.6562303	0.6863211	-0.0647	-0.0249119551351	0.95615649	3064	3819	3206.264	3629.4122	1.5023792	1.6079898	-0.0980	-0.0346010665546	0.934321410	7231	8468	7334.6563	8242.0077	3.2762191	3.6910367	-0.1720	-0.179067327523	0.887614911	23138	20989	22382.893	21068.272	9.1711615	9.1258884	0.0071	-0.0442056147131	1.00496112	2472	2590	2606.6717	2438.1005	1.335443	1.1762031	0.1832	0.226919577679	1.135384713	1624	1861	1731.7211	1745.2698	2.2468415	2.3187439	-0.0454	0.0203340712695	0.968990814	8249	8365	8342.2004	8138.2438	3.7536986	3.5325893	0.0876	0.12714538804	1.062591315	4553	4497	4695.4155	4290.2589	2.0599415	1.8573638	0.1493	0.0298380242324	1.109067316	2328	2710	2458.4885	2554.6992	1.2945909	1.2515282	0.0488	0.0400983266815	1.03440817	2116	2301	2240.5702	2162.258	0.9404241	0.8896531	0.0801	-0.0417001548246	1.057068318	3281	4174	3421.6182	3974.2941	1.2105693	1.4486732	-0.2590	-0.181880720755	0.8356419	2662	3243	2801.5275	3071.9635	1.2996463	1.3579053	-0.0633	-0.116528527975	0.957096420	1206	1095	1297.835	1031.23	0.5800434	0.4769638	0.2823	0.0500003848412	1.2161163!sample_table_end
