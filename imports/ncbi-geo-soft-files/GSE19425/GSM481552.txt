Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481552/suppl/GSM481552_EL174.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4183	4338	4286.4351	4194.6338	1.9169819	1.8363762	-0.0620	0.0170530371278	0.95795172	1733	1587	1806.7807	1530.2555	0.7325793	0.6262804	-0.2262	-0.136816038529	0.85489773	3627	3157	3725.288	3037.4889	1.6367656	1.2772572	-0.3578	-0.413061072691	0.78035434	12373	10437	12104.341	10287.812	5.3106621	4.3548251	-0.2863	-0.200598485949	0.82001545	23685	18969	22292.101	19042.457	11.946274	9.4111456	-0.3441	-0.357695220399	0.78778916	9173	8154	9132.089	7973.35	4.6443245	3.8543053	-0.2690	-0.272417469633	0.82989577	1748	1900	1821.9216	1827.4701	0.9361591	0.8635999	-0.1164	-0.257818071384	0.92249268	3017	2852	3116.7621	2745.7813	1.3051613	1.1414178	-0.1934	-0.184114752858	0.87454159	5155	5084	5257.3673	4920.8658	1.8328603	1.7728847	-0.0480	-0.0771258802929	0.967277510	13341	11673	13001.863	11558.583	6.0175052	5.4870126	-0.1331	-0.10566093976	0.911841711	17775	14682	17021.853	14666.955	7.5831133	6.7084148	-0.1768	-0.241220569043	0.884651712	10938	9118	10784.732	8947.8093	5.0402645	4.0288199	-0.3231	-0.338475065909	0.79932713	5897	5449	5976.1102	5274.4219	2.764607	2.4833985	-0.1548	-0.287132142581	0.898282614	16565	14253	15927.678	14226.604	7.1720537	6.4484815	-0.1534	-0.269624737425	0.899112215	2954	3548	3052.6332	3417.0497	1.2775235	1.4272345	0.1599	-0.0302559692183	1.117188416	4814	5512	4921.2131	5336.1065	2.1334351	2.2232346	0.0595	-0.168664146588	1.042091417	815	669	845.9937	664.6153	0.3678217	0.2911104	-0.3374	-0.194048042978	0.791444318	4451	4437	4557.8327	4292.387	2.4653813	2.2535602	-0.1296	-0.093128209563	0.914081819	2668	2667	2760.3345	2567.4389	1.1986143	1.1482416	-0.0619	-0.0509580542672	0.957974220	5242	4684	5341.7531	4534.2047	1.9112748	1.7619766	-0.1173	-0.0764890822342	0.9218855!sample_table_end
