Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481660/suppl/GSM481660_JA814.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2976	3101	3053.9319	2932.7127	1.3064637	1.1965468	-0.1268	-0.0354494796905	0.91586682	2928	2746	3006.2095	2596.8634	1.2945427	0.9301905	-0.4768	-0.256458509181	0.71854753	2176	1792	2250.6259	1717.3879	1.2362137	0.9988059	-0.3077	-0.107179707456	0.80795574	5773	3101	5737.383	2932.7127	3.2319044	1.6925692	-0.9332	-0.593386750897	0.52370645	8607	5062	8398.125	4762.0856	5.1373437	3.0568474	-0.7490	-0.553092888246	0.59502486	5118	4228	5119.5608	3986.7948	2.8224475	2.298096	-0.2965	-0.166114207868	0.81422097	717	614	756.9121	628.2807	0.7731539	0.7752956	0.0040	0.0317627402447	1.00277018	1232	1073	1294.9876	1055.6265	0.7615314	0.5905738	-0.3668	-0.170269789046	0.77550819	3768	4353	3829.6048	4100.5143	1.6252281	1.4150193	-0.1998	-0.110006230946	0.870658810	6706	7606	6616.5977	7212.856	2.6071348	2.5158235	-0.0514	-0.381583795756	0.964976311	14066	10762	13460.708	10287.301	5.8921926	4.3808824	-0.4276	-0.174088430145	0.743506312	3171	2053	3246.8099	1953.8575	1.9392078	1.3558922	-0.5162	-0.435717386621	0.69919913	4233	4245	4280.0831	4002.1162	1.6911126	1.682845	-0.0071	-0.0546217230472	0.995111114	9126	7292	8881.9793	6906.9168	3.4052602	2.3677734	-0.5242	-0.342296892554	0.695328215	2676	3129	2755.3663	2958.801	1.3454095	1.4150864	0.0728	-0.0450524626403	1.051788616	1223	1245	1285.9201	1214.6451	0.87613	0.9504394	0.1174	-0.0402478099769	1.084815517	1836	2276	1916.6769	2161.6148	0.8179033	0.774093	-0.0794	-0.0803505331728	0.946435818	3209	3449	3283.5663	3260.2357	1.5212405	1.4891301	-0.0308	-0.169526811253	0.97889219	2497	3451	2575.4346	3262.1609	1.2107829	1.290613	0.0921	0.233546361065	1.065932520	1357	1386	1425.7647	1342.1464	0.5746825	0.4584698	-0.3259	-0.122119566067	0.7977792!sample_table_end
