Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481907/suppl/GSM481907_MR321.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6209	6166	6381.3814	5826.6055	1.5406342	1.3062811	0.2381	0.167327994396	1.17940482	5594	6173	5803.3141	5833.5499	1.4942644	1.2695665	0.2351	0.107012623762	1.17698793	6828	4840	6968.3017	4532.6526	1.4264135	0.9911271	0.5253	0.102310364677	1.43918324	15102	12381	14444.923	12075.632	3.152868	2.7925141	0.1751	-0.0760618269169	1.12904285	31432	24030	28923.823	23887.075	6.0967964	5.5212081	0.1431	-0.0949244634658	1.10425046	11394	13617	11116.809	13333.404	2.3658389	3.0554251	-0.3690	-0.226451958661	0.77430767	5326	5246	5558.4869	4936.9512	1.1267223	1.1057024	0.0272	-0.0102773897333	1.01901048	3072	3886	3349.3796	3608.0431	0.7404009	0.8441803	-0.1892	-0.0527697955762	0.87706499	6504	9172	6662.5806	8868.3015	1.6511789	1.7778984	-0.1067	-0.00175681466771	0.928725110	9603	12073	9539.2473	11764.399	2.7078012	3.403277	-0.3298	-0.254123040596	0.795645311	30838	25308	28390.149	25202.942	7.1510232	6.9658761	0.0378	-0.0454915502373	1.026579212	14329	10607	13750.854	10273.438	2.9972539	2.4195486	0.3089	-0.0479324806871	1.238765713	8131	9905	8165.765	9583.5355	2.3861732	2.6588155	-0.1561	-0.0939465796448	0.897457214	17764	19585	16812.38	19373.014	4.3423818	4.4438504	-0.0333	-0.133161874115	0.977166515	5811	5741	6001.171	5424.1506	1.3122112	1.2797313	0.0362	0.0222500487943	1.025380216	6274	5793	6443.421	5472.5819	1.2676757	1.1923479	0.0884	0.0618277535757	1.06317617	2687	3851	2978.1591	3574.2851	0.7707427	0.8108412	-0.0732	0.00217034406718	0.95054718	7858	8838	7918.0036	8526.5047	1.7487502	1.940981	-0.1505	-0.0735059888828	0.900962119	5650	6177	5854.4608	5837.5123	1.5910082	1.3262839	0.2626	0.121751617695	1.199598520	4042	3456	4313.3807	3190.2084	0.849555	0.6374647	0.4144	0.128588245602	1.332709!sample_table_end
