Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481813/suppl/GSM481813_MR065.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5584	5149	5480.6043	5195.9288	1.4660231	1.3397271	0.1300	0.0875926440187	1.094272	3599	3919	3563.7405	3959.3963	0.9883917	1.0607896	-0.1020	-0.0366264094777	0.9317513	4941	4223	4865.0808	4269.1416	1.298792	1.1369082	0.1921	0.00727603168574	1.14238964	9750	8919	9501.2599	8951.9062	2.5639193	2.4550256	0.0626	-0.155932972313	1.04435545	13914	13415	13536.428	13438.249	3.5366111	3.6030016	-0.0268	-0.19047195572	0.98157366	9123	8175	8888.3345	8207.7849	2.4546962	2.3137794	0.0853	0.0965224323421	1.06090337	2631	2451	2643.7178	2461.4773	0.6776916	0.6087595	0.1548	0.150466873207	1.11323378	2256	2429	2280.5839	2439.0761	0.5888761	0.6355721	-0.1101	-0.0167798964038	0.92652929	7223	7284	7062.481	7322.1322	1.8428712	1.8306804	0.0096	-0.0304558027356	1.006659210	13647	12221	13275.382	12253.835	3.1790965	3.1606734	0.0084	-0.0223756441787	1.005828811	20915	19149	20390.918	19143.167	4.8838623	4.9196904	-0.0105	-0.0681433761798	0.992717412	7476	7274	7299.0621	7312.1394	1.838614	1.6935911	0.1185	0.0705290564443	1.085630413	11288	11829	10995.093	11864.937	2.33995	2.4386327	-0.0596	-0.0190366276777	0.959533614	10594	10970	10327.447	11012.944	2.8356977	2.9634694	-0.0636	-0.0919650279314	0.956884415	6525	6084	6390.7603	6128.4808	1.5550202	1.544131	0.0101	0.0573652849782	1.00705216	4489	4949	4426.307	4997.038	1.0737047	1.0802105	-0.0087	0.0347208519355	0.993977317	2266	2397	2290.082	2406.4944	0.6288165	0.6370896	-0.0189	-0.0989650098994	0.987014218	6716	5223	6578.1302	5269.4846	1.6874606	1.3878582	0.2820	0.233120135972	1.21587419	4467	5226	4405.1124	5272.4655	1.2577491	1.4072497	-0.1620	-0.0659599438461	0.89376420	2926	2533	2924.7441	2544.8886	0.6764306	0.6206532	0.1242	0.10101423589	1.0898689!sample_table_end
