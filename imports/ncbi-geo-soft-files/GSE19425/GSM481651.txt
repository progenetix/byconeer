Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481651/suppl/GSM481651_JA807.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2481	1940	2250.3994	2122.9199	1.2279232	1.2083684	0.0232	-0.27288698372	1.01618282	1277	1291	1160.3324	1445.7057	0.7735787	1.055515	-0.4483	-0.603619563096	0.73289223	2430	2177	2204.8837	2367.9699	0.9920493	1.0495302	-0.0813	-0.19532078089	0.94523174	3805	5149	3457.7277	5307.0519	1.6116736	2.5538297	-0.6641	-0.91707359914	0.6310815	7482	10876	6801.4823	10952.467	3.0106969	4.5632597	-0.6000	-0.880303221122	0.65976896	5986	4639	5453.8099	4805.082	2.5992785	2.2875474	0.1843	0.000779133436089	1.1362737	2590	1833	2350.9856	2014.4507	0.9742839	0.7409525	0.3950	0.221349388068	1.31490728	1465	1412	1329.3347	1572.7162	0.5903178	0.7204229	-0.2874	-0.372924974707	0.81940469	1520	1487	1380.3186	1651.1367	0.8992	1.179239	-0.3911	-0.440708939724	0.762525610	4829	5149	4395.6953	5307.0519	2.0785632	2.6919958	-0.3731	-0.307687882856	0.772127211	11205	10043	10185.269	10122.443	4.8452078	5.0863472	-0.0701	-0.381441806395	0.952590812	3697	5234	3360.5364	5390.7852	1.3873348	2.1910156	-0.6593	-0.712381185097	0.633192513	2893	3716	2631.6799	3897.3016	1.0660436	1.6228382	-0.6063	-0.483650045357	0.656900714	3233	4328	2942.8085	4502.3787	1.935584	3.1387064	-0.6974	-0.863571579619	0.61668215	3862	3960	3509.0152	4142.3186	1.3949941	1.6825696	-0.2704	-0.143379910969	0.829085516	2168	3028	1967.6753	3227.2996	0.7791892	1.225567	-0.6534	-0.457464206782	0.635778517	1419	1032	1286.5512	1177.7112	0.8136702	0.8096733	0.0071	-0.0899400517144	1.004936518	2495	3029	2262.8902	3228.2631	1.1540378	1.5408582	-0.4170	-0.514449662811	0.748957819	2030	1873	1839.4781	2055.1404	1.1589043	1.4357323	-0.3090	-0.141027026508	0.807186920	775	586	712.373	691.2791	0.3795247	0.4123005	-0.1195	-0.336424841129	0.920505!sample_table_end
