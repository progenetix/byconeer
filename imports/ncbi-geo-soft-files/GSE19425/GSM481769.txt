Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481769/suppl/GSM481769_JBH541.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1975	1867	2095.6294	1730.9326	1.2779432	1.0705089	0.2555	0.0468144167419	1.19377162	1670	2120	1777.0244	1962.0472	1.1048173	1.1569057	-0.0665	-0.163429226064	0.95497613	822	920	890.4335	863.55852	0.5477048	0.5617589	-0.0366	0.00461586846588	0.9749824	5107	5407	5298.1163	4983.8595	2.9540854	3.1549191	-0.0949	-0.276699761949	0.93634265	5844	9113	6036.587	8402.491	4.0595452	6.109722	-0.5898	-0.318760729002	0.66444026	5972	6279	6165.7124	5782.2218	4.0994937	4.0832053	0.0057	-0.147008259057	1.00398917	884	1121	957.3355	1045.7667	0.8024266	0.9609856	-0.2601	-0.176497353487	0.83500378	1324	1565	1422.5092	1456.7527	0.7762839	0.8732411	-0.1698	-0.241194393627	0.88896859	3173	3548	3341.3175	3271.03	1.9100573	1.733623	0.1398	0.0511904046799	1.10177210	5200	6786	5391.8598	6253.7601	3.2297188	3.8359625	-0.2482	-0.0661433827081	0.841957811	8291	8856	8483.0472	8164.5813	4.8425039	4.9919995	-0.0439	-0.13846762381	0.970052912	1978	1903	2098.7325	1763.8119	1.6279328	1.528574	0.0909	-0.104585643936	1.065000913	1019	1428	1099.2996	1328.5811	0.8958331	1.0671812	-0.2525	0.0892021239219	0.839438614	1601	2437	1706.9784	2252.5724	1.5655117	1.6906741	-0.1110	-0.215852760718	0.925968915	1133	1172	1219.8835	1093.23	0.8185641	0.8071589	0.0202	0.0572854229435	1.0141316	714	919	775.883	862.63828	0.5816993	0.7404005	-0.3480	-0.0429333684722	0.785654817	413	594	455.521	565.22318	0.2957399	0.3465915	-0.2289	0.0321145293045	0.853280818	2008	2804	2129.7628	2592.2115	1.5566933	1.8075476	-0.2155	-0.0980113906917	0.861218419	949	1334	1026.5628	1241.5388	0.5763052	0.6771548	-0.2327	0.0157885625226	0.851068620	1722	1638	1829.9291	1522.3065	0.9850202	0.79477	0.3096	0.0285610900549	1.2393776!sample_table_end
