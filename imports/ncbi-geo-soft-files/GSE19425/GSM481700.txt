Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481700/suppl/GSM481700_JBH100.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	732	875	736.5094	867.9857	0.9633329	1.09552	0.1855	0.129491145728	1.13721852	593	756	586.648	757.457	1.0338441	1.2468267	0.2702	0.243241448601	1.20601053	980	876	998.9326	868.9092	1.0193287	0.8943204	-0.1888	-0.111663679167	0.87736214	3805	3692	3858.3122	3531.3331	3.2792424	3.0717466	-0.0943	-0.00788259630431	0.93672455	4294	4877	4337.2724	4674.9024	4.5360357	4.7853945	0.0772	0.0154106453996	1.05497296	2247	2839	2299.6909	2710.1737	2.6008017	3.0276173	0.2192	0.142511988715	1.16410937	1462	1586	1499.89	1527.4429	0.9831642	1.0122749	0.0421	0.168251916071	1.02960928	1146	1306	1173.808	1265.6982	0.7963566	0.889955	0.1603	0.212816085522	1.11753339	770	876	777.9724	868.9092	1.3702173	1.4130341	0.0444	0.046019374432	1.031248210	4630	5275	4667.2315	5065.1159	2.7307727	3.0980077	0.1820	-0.0150754365142	1.134480311	7662	7287	7584.4259	7045.9652	4.4901638	4.4307581	-0.0192	-0.0591781534406	0.986769812	3205	3174	3262.0303	3032.5163	1.8149801	1.7289082	-0.0701	-0.106958720694	0.952576913	2247	2403	2299.6909	2296.3948	1.4007069	1.4179178	0.0176	-0.121064603292	1.012287314	1105	1500	1130.4367	1446.5077	2.5619287	2.9395204	0.1984	-0.0303373402428	1.147385715	2271	2506	2324.2208	2392.7978	1.2432475	1.3252784	0.0922	0.0540731369423	1.065981216	1469	1727	1507.1698	1659.3547	0.8433851	0.9596834	0.1864	-0.0469556098862	1.137894817	430	330	408.0086	363.323	0.6710003	0.5645668	-0.2492	-0.0876508141173	0.841380918	793	830	802.674	826.3608	1.2264394	1.1516551	-0.0908	-0.149919151533	0.939023219	702	687	704.3298	694.3879	1.0845458	1.0249469	-0.0815	-0.216455944227	0.945047220	1011	721	1031.3854	725.5917	0.7270373	0.5343604	-0.4442	-0.0392807672687	0.7349835!sample_table_end
