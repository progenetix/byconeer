Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481595/suppl/GSM481595_EL657.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2155	2031	2201.7917	1974.5365	0.8319075	0.7582896	0.1337	-0.124529327949	1.09708412	2676	2356	2721.3778	2294.371	1.2253699	1.0000712	0.2931	0.031253743115	1.22528263	1045	1311	1083.6916	1278.4068	0.4410738	0.5190517	-0.2349	-0.261452169895	0.84976854	14206	13784	13946.488	13557.59	5.1950104	5.2940938	-0.0273	-0.0767272684967	0.98128415	14172	18976	13914.179	18837.647	6.2991724	8.5823977	-0.4462	0.0136802108905	0.73396416	12367	10223	12210.742	9995.4056	5.4649748	4.6152101	0.2438	0.262468036873	1.18412267	1418	1769	1462.7152	1724.5667	1.0150209	1.1163993	-0.1373	0.149263658454	0.90919168	1550	1864	1595.7547	1815.0142	0.7483866	0.9047503	-0.2737	-0.138453411052	0.82717479	3784	3839	3833.8035	3742.3837	1.7749675	1.6326406	0.1206	0.025889050611	1.087175810	13503	14621	13282.448	14407.639	6.0198524	6.7780197	-0.1711	-0.0810733980892	0.888143211	5275	5796	5312.0649	5642.5807	2.6079758	2.8592547	-0.1327	-0.125096166515	0.912117312	4071	4857	4115.4681	4733.217	2.3495102	2.6382568	-0.1672	-0.27673506613	0.89055413	849	1072	884.7849	1046.8219	0.4889384	0.560033	-0.1959	-0.244331678962	0.873052814	3260	3365	3309.4585	3275.6502	2.3464458	2.2329373	0.0715	-0.148784443174	1.050833715	829	910	863.8287	891.6415	0.4964283	0.5163498	-0.0568	-0.158325994632	0.961418516	820	1260	854.3993	1229.2683	0.5193111	0.717464	-0.4663	-0.256732308278	0.723814817	419	420	429.7493	427.7011	0.182316	0.1775426	0.0383	-0.114502758427	1.026885818	3777	3831	3826.9506	3734.6006	1.8158458	1.7371082	0.0640	-0.059597565295	1.045326819	765	1007	797.262	984.5538	0.3470689	0.4251218	-0.2927	-0.136719425805	0.816398720	2836	2836	2881.2433	2759.8844	1.087485	1.0795074	0.0106	-0.146289168538	1.0073901!sample_table_end
