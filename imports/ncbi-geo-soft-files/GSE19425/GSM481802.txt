Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481802/suppl/GSM481802_MR044.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4265	5375	4775.6977	4657.0631	1.6845866	1.4141218	-0.2525	-0.192867781293	0.83944742	1515	3333	1833.7629	2841.0639	0.7888738	0.9434834	0.2582	0.184453090051	1.19598773	4927	4659	5464.1023	4018.6959	1.4830967	1.1219872	-0.4026	-0.232884654465	0.75651654	7701	9216	8181.5342	8130.4319	2.0836971	2.4141179	0.2124	0.179991359095	1.15857435	19862	16578	19248.063	15107.646	4.079439	4.1897034	0.0385	0.0735863675213	1.02702936	12580	13047	12784.562	11732.031	4.0459899	3.587968	-0.1733	-0.0576864631747	0.88679617	5434	6602	5975.6087	5735.7198	1.8254793	1.6813596	-0.1186	-0.0455710305181	0.9210518	3160	4051	3636.2026	3479.5668	0.9305057	1.0398326	0.1603	-0.0269259956164	1.11749199	8826	9856	9258.4437	8724.8683	2.901187	2.6619842	-0.1241	-0.00125631188957	0.9175510	14688	17819	14708.669	16303.231	5.5143785	5.6591495	0.0374	0.00190266944499	1.026253411	13394	13253	13525.614	11928.938	3.7326802	3.8933035	0.0608	-0.0531932908988	1.043031612	3891	6280	4410.9936	5441.2169	1.3986964	1.7587182	0.3304	0.11430585072	1.257398113	3422	5598	3916.6357	4856.1761	2.0271041	1.8624676	-0.1222	-0.107210382883	0.918782414	3712	7811	4226.8313	6841.9998	1.8328264	2.2040644	0.2661	0.0721626151284	1.202549515	4017	3523	4535.9088	3010.3206	1.1307784	0.9004459	-0.3286	-0.204224359508	0.796306216	5325	6078	5867.8032	5264.7026	1.7665608	1.5461832	-0.1922	-0.144908368886	0.875250517	950	2111	1165.8874	1812.9356	0.5639595	0.5931734	0.0729	-0.0383210392054	1.051801318	4831	8370	5364.3788	7342.3197	1.8009317	2.177796	0.2741	0.0862467989185	1.209260719	5593	5199	6131.5909	4496.8389	1.6286767	1.4261033	-0.1916	-0.266076972151	0.875620920	1861	2590	2226.9141	2218.9622	0.8028899	0.7393427	-0.1190	-0.0512959250158	0.9208519!sample_table_end
