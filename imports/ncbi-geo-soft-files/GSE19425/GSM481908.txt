Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481908/suppl/GSM481908_MR322.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	11003	7458	9607.6669	8355.8716	1.5122939	1.3831201	-0.1288	0.167327994396	0.91458422	9647	8065	8443.7963	9028.4173	1.3527351	1.4194037	0.0694	0.107012623762	1.04928433	8445	5329	7427.1189	6011.665	1.166061	1.022461	-0.1896	0.102310364677	0.87685044	22690	14303	19673.46	15812.955	3.0256138	2.6389682	-0.1973	-0.0760618269169	0.87220915	34401	20727	29856.368	22788.838	4.8630269	3.943493	-0.3024	-0.0949244634658	0.81091326	18263	11702	15840.576	12989.06	2.5776609	2.2618016	-0.1886	-0.226451958661	0.87746287	5130	3947	4558.6891	4480.2131	0.9389866	0.8556243	-0.1341	-0.0102773897333	0.91122098	6001	3926	5322.6329	4456.8642	0.8000293	0.7202515	-0.1516	-0.0527697955762	0.90028139	18623	15325	16154.266	16907.018	2.3801094	2.4581963	0.0466	-0.00175681466771	1.032808110	17057	15963	14804.717	17590.295	2.8691769	3.4666385	0.2729	-0.254123040596	1.208234411	44811	29986	39327.357	32820.996	7.043432	6.2568693	-0.1708	-0.0454915502373	0.888326712	15329	10685	13331.052	11891.739	2.8430763	2.4546359	-0.2119	-0.0479324806871	0.863373213	6574	7548	5811.2615	8456.0855	1.4696796	1.8381906	0.3228	-0.0939465796448	1.250742314	23515	19508	20391.229	21440.884	3.8950058	3.6187282	-0.1061	-0.133161874115	0.929068715	6702	5961	5923.381	6713.0942	1.1560899	1.3087146	0.1789	0.0222500487943	1.13201816	5475	5228	4863.8236	5899.2414	0.9684548	1.1279473	0.2199	0.0618277535757	1.164687517	4706	4454	4189.9161	5034.8424	0.6635437	0.8006271	0.2709	0.00217034406718	1.206592818	10650	8985	9311.7859	10044.857	1.5919163	1.6558094	0.0568	-0.0735059888828	1.040135919	7070	7227	6245.3684	8098.6726	1.060471	1.3338812	0.3309	0.121751617695	1.257819520	4996	3094	4440.0093	3517.4685	0.7088333	0.5735279	-0.3056	0.128588245602	0.8091152!sample_table_end
