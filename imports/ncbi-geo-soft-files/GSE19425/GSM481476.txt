Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481476/suppl/GSM481476_DE371.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5249	2599	3980.029	3228.4724	1.2900412	1.3098659	0.0220	-0.100155377165	1.01536752	1946	1610	1584.2948	1988.7614	0.8819582	0.9199549	0.0609	0.126740843785	1.04308223	7547	3565	5599.2358	4446.5774	1.9167274	1.9226207	0.0044	0.00445134198367	1.00307474	8607	3895	6343.1742	4865.2014	2.1916708	2.2500978	0.0380	0.084614969746	1.02665875	14304	7555	10313.028	9521.4059	4.5970715	4.5000837	-0.0308	-0.0363884344262	0.97890236	10109	4590	7389.6805	5755.3469	2.6099264	2.5774831	-0.0180	-0.0461904060479	0.98756937	1367	1006	1142.2277	1251.5872	1.0085581	0.7635243	-0.4015	-0.123576473358	0.75704558	2199	972	1776.0181	1210.9139	0.6348564	0.5569074	-0.1890	-0.0659216611371	0.87721799	4724	3262	3598.1401	4070.2959	2.0148408	1.7898699	-0.1708	-0.27332636351	0.888343110	10790	7589	7863.4012	9565.5566	3.8802723	4.8556294	0.3235	-0.113550647808	1.251363111	31796	14995	21913.93	19390.426	9.9278368	10.166617	0.0343	-0.093430741826	1.024051612	2622	2162	2084.043	2662.5197	1.4476515	1.5727253	0.1196	0.0578348009744	1.086397713	4143	4290	3183.0516	5374.3948	2.6037726	3.4568805	0.4089	0.02127204966	1.32764314	6208	5828	4658.0092	7294.4345	3.339129	3.5445049	0.0861	-0.060428435574	1.061505815	5100	3879	3872.2055	4844.6118	2.134817	2.6269053	0.2993	0.0825809291798	1.230506116	2929	2683	2308.9724	3332.0131	1.6905043	1.931043	0.1919	-0.0827575508402	1.142288117	2803	2050	2216.3291	2526.2078	1.0244442	1.0803788	0.0767	0.0312288956189	1.054618	7036	3819	5239.0238	4767.4385	1.8500553	1.9700037	0.0906	0.00351732744103	1.064835119	3533	2815	2751.707	3497.9359	1.4347834	1.5852318	0.1439	-0.0593715106238	1.10485820	2395	1229	1922.0987	1525.9447	0.8704086	0.7167558	-0.2802	0.010154798049	0.8234705!sample_table_end
