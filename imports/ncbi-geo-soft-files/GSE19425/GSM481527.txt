Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481527/suppl/GSM481527_DE492.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1520	2085	1797.5128	1775.2103	0.6796445	0.653684	0.0562	0.27725970756	1.03971412	3088	2976	3478.2132	2574.9545	1.5910414	1.1755375	0.4367	0.371620750811	1.35345863	3027	2803	3415.7464	2417.9369	1.1874005	0.8380912	0.5026	0.690175069006	1.41679144	12643	13409	10966.368	13782.351	3.917103	4.8828959	-0.3180	-0.289792366436	0.80220895	12493	12526	10864.81	12841.051	4.0170712	4.7698	-0.2478	-0.391028276441	0.84218866	7366	10980	7187.4496	11181.189	2.7436756	4.3837573	-0.6761	-0.660236199473	0.6258737	3055	3440	3444.8682	3014.4805	1.3345535	1.2396625	0.1064	-0.0730492327901	1.07654588	1919	2765	2238.4312	2383.5988	0.7608659	0.8217821	-0.1111	-0.176032018676	0.9258739	1545	2116	1825.8544	1802.4386	0.7487991	0.7614107	-0.0241	-0.0862710426824	0.983436510	7584	10194	7355.8463	10310.068	2.7142858	3.8863881	-0.5179	-0.461994296536	0.698408311	9993	8170	9120.7829	8051.1816	3.1312686	2.8505329	0.1355	0.18083873772	1.098485312	12075	13704	10580.384	14088.295	3.8765433	5.1812904	-0.4185	-0.04419209263	0.74818113	2333	3042	2683.4072	2635.2399	0.9168811	0.9595018	-0.0656	0.119585263471	0.955580314	6356	6926	6396.8579	6687.9619	3.1237848	3.3787982	-0.1132	-0.138504212379	0.924525415	2436	2803	2792.1534	2417.9369	0.9207479	0.7992503	0.2042	0.227104843811	1.152014416	1939	2698	2260.634	2323.4119	0.805439	0.8592827	-0.0934	0.221681863345	0.937338717	629	704	774.6172	630.5138	0.3404638	0.2781481	0.2916	0.220904936918	1.22403818	3246	4671	3636.3309	4231.0014	1.3773038	1.7546204	-0.3493	-0.356920258309	0.784958219	920	1553	1119.8151	1319.2061	0.5004664	0.5652373	-0.1756	-0.0707369056155	0.885409320	1287	1912	1536.5465	1623.2231	0.5779288	0.5965698	-0.0458	0.0708613554401	0.968753!sample_table_end
