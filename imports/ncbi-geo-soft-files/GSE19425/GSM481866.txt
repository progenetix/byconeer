Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481866/suppl/GSM481866_MR270.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6253	4776	6120.0296	4844.1868	1.4991446	1.1583631	-0.3721	-0.22360846197	0.77268272	5624	5343	5514.2259	5413.3604	1.3939859	1.3022687	-0.0982	-0.0483705958942	0.93420513	5039	3367	4945.0136	3415.5738	1.1682347	0.8226304	-0.5060	-0.317081899295	0.70416544	12287	9355	11956.25	9480.1709	2.9229521	2.35282	-0.3130	-0.11390515674	0.80494655	16773	14104	16364.371	14223.538	3.8381369	3.3835455	-0.1819	-0.0492375076027	0.88155946	8408	6986	8194.6764	7083.7764	2.0368813	1.7670283	-0.2050	-0.127364789264	0.86751667	2946	2530	2916.081	2572.819	0.7052252	0.6204058	-0.1849	-0.187392343467	0.87972738	3004	2865	2972.6046	2908.1576	0.7216412	0.7285915	0.0138	-0.0539682846944	1.00963139	7616	6877	7431.6818	6973.2943	1.792586	1.6093985	-0.1555	-0.131289279502	0.897808210	9918	8281	9656.7752	8398.181	2.6851127	2.3645119	-0.1834	-0.174255411587	0.880600611	18794	16332	18372.218	16406.39	4.8746895	4.5896564	-0.0869	-0.109117471073	0.941527912	10251	7535	9977.91	7641.1198	2.3920172	1.8385549	-0.3797	-0.32417104625	0.768621113	7316	6286	7146.74	6380.8033	1.7980838	1.5738884	-0.1921	-0.277906851084	0.875314314	13484	12749	13122.759	12866.671	3.1506249	2.8398536	-0.1498	-0.132247338367	0.90136215	5759	5492	5644.1737	5566.0194	1.327659	1.3590582	0.0337	-0.044320951779	1.023650116	4169	3932	4104.9121	3987.1142	0.9530907	0.933347	-0.0302	-0.198069325734	0.979284617	2226	1878	2213.3688	1911.3651	0.5547271	0.4610532	-0.2668	-0.264369828241	0.831135118	6991	6667	6834.7283	6762.2107	1.4095585	1.3366522	-0.0766	-0.126073547637	0.948277219	4154	4098	4090.3829	4154.694	1.0605532	1.038181	-0.0308	-0.134018476083	0.978905120	3478	2855	3438.0842	2898.1724	0.8540421	0.730318	-0.2258	-0.166848692374	0.8551311!sample_table_end
