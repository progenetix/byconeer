Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481905/suppl/GSM481905_MR319.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6905	5602	6334.7833	5924.6352	1.3524767	1.3379735	0.0156	0.0560755825592	1.01083972	6807	5394	6252.1858	5697.3508	1.4585689	1.291659	0.1753	0.0771270316751	1.12922133	6398	4651	5912.0543	4912.2806	1.2601161	1.0920903	0.2065	-0.0570824858883	1.15385714	17540	10932	15093.662	11669.186	2.9300783	2.5541015	0.1981	-0.0645502398279	1.14720515	20687	14662	17685.214	15680.982	4.6975914	4.0537949	0.2126	-0.0601340682252	1.15881336	11849	10186	10462.475	10873.932	2.4529899	2.6560806	-0.1148	-0.0993200943421	0.92353757	2860	3104	2810.2215	3238.8897	0.9809651	0.8135289	0.2700	0.111142315487	1.20581478	4605	4113	4376.1244	4331.2582	0.776418	0.8738834	-0.1706	-0.0434511156049	0.88846879	9989	10783	8896.8151	11510.337	1.9138752	2.3798411	-0.3144	-0.105602853062	0.804202910	14344	13568	12506.214	14497.393	2.6528411	3.5402732	-0.4163	-0.297382932418	0.749332311	41837	29522	35862.441	31100.711	6.9130352	7.1852155	-0.0557	-0.0922700847095	0.962119412	13391	9457	11729.927	10095.882	2.6822977	2.1651235	0.3090	-0.0478741221069	1.238865913	7109	8295	6510.1726	8856.7224	1.784653	2.2298597	-0.3213	-0.176558757265	0.800343214	15442	15560	13396.918	16650.837	3.8546274	3.7944067	0.0227	-0.105141486831	1.015870915	7015	6145	6429.1254	6528.4453	1.2396775	1.4100098	-0.1857	-0.0886995805047	0.879197816	4131	5043	3948.3482	5335.0176	1.0063465	1.1919809	-0.2442	-0.104479470609	0.84426417	2598	3008	2574.4131	3138.0094	0.5976764	0.7188249	-0.2663	-0.0943825692234	0.831463118	7191	7481	6580.822	7986.7671	1.6530728	1.7525491	-0.0843	-0.0404274444923	0.943239119	4374	5290	4168.7042	5588.2092	0.9076122	1.2109943	-0.4160	-0.217546192195	0.749476920	4248	3215	4054.4351	3356.8976	0.7690609	0.7196872	0.0957	-0.0307287013028	1.0686044!sample_table_end
