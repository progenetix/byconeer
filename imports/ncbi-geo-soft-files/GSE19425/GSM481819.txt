Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481819/suppl/GSM481819_MR071.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6994	4561	6335.7439	4976.1989	1.3685309	1.0341573	0.4042	0.463677589974	1.32332942	5385	4611	4931.2669	5029.4531	1.1911342	1.0606288	0.1674	0.170537984532	1.12304533	4787	4074	4398.442	4447.1584	0.8950742	0.9111492	-0.0257	-0.131465365647	0.98235744	14686	12122	12973.771	12862.745	2.5491519	2.7413706	-0.1049	-0.208007958122	0.92988225	19205	15872	16795.873	16764.396	3.344726	3.4631325	-0.0502	-0.285178178957	0.96580946	9689	9999	8706.557	10618.33	1.9092936	2.3886964	-0.3232	-0.378798639913	0.79930357	3217	3421	3041.2367	3747.6266	0.6241015	0.7524734	-0.2699	-0.499736769251	0.82948	4218	3164	3910.209	3463.1895	0.7389815	0.7273172	0.0230	0.049189388861	1.01603739	6205	5765	5654.82	6235.8222	1.3344347	1.2483624	0.0962	0.128545223691	1.068948110	15285	13458	13480.389	14241.387	2.6364434	3.0328649	-0.2021	-0.0496587277861	0.869291411	19522	15576	17069.255	16457.226	3.2440001	3.4588579	-0.0925	-0.0624883402585	0.937881812	9924	9843	8910.5539	10454.067	1.8165264	2.1715434	-0.2575	-0.192686891973	0.836513913	7124	7019	6447.9022	7532.835	1.3377285	1.4906284	-0.1561	-0.0602536942538	0.897425914	12864	11876	11428.422	12602.162	2.8567282	2.5192336	0.1814	-0.0114110513753	1.133967115	8377	5111	7535.127	5568.5042	1.4301164	1.1028428	0.3749	0.428491040357	1.296754416	4942	4616	4530.8072	5034.7751	0.9385411	1.0390212	-0.1467	0.0537928228113	0.903293517	2064	2247	2024.3949	2453.6563	0.4839622	0.522438	-0.1104	0.0256397722863	0.926353318	8192	7044	7371.8792	7558.6837	1.4730179	1.4850295	-0.0117	0.178185582553	0.991911519	4484	4022	4142.8599	4391.2163	1.0358874	0.9540625	0.1187	0.159023178308	1.085764620	5033	3145	4610.8466	3442.7794	0.9001735	0.7323705	0.2976	0.215197970214	1.229123!sample_table_end
