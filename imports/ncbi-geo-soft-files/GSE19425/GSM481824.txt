Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481824/suppl/GSM481824_MR092.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3785	2416	3383.4842	2680.8749	1.3038833	1.0500827	-0.3123	-0.335005362201	0.80535022	3681	2491	3292.9867	2763.4399	1.2219313	1.0550312	-0.2119	-0.0907192354686	0.86341283	2658	1956	2391.1588	2173.4894	0.9525898	0.8620574	-0.1441	-0.0797750664769	0.90496194	12597	9657	11097.943	10279.446	4.3488033	4.1085493	-0.0820	-0.0348878603101	0.94475395	15849	11776	13865.274	12437.253	6.0634418	5.1744389	-0.2287	0.0042888105156	0.85338316	8414	7281	7479.2766	7810.8587	3.3155031	3.4080497	0.0397	0.0454179470546	1.02791337	1889	1845	1706.2582	2054.2184	0.8421958	0.854669	0.0212	0.167349191892	1.01481038	2818	2349	2529.9243	2606.9588	1.0611493	1.1178765	0.0751	-0.0659465636596	1.05345829	6929	4086	6168.8119	4472.2303	2.1258739	1.581183	-0.4271	-0.211776426674	0.743780210	10030	7570	8887.6903	8118.6315	4.3060918	3.9036276	-0.1416	-0.175974842325	0.90653611	9250	4841	8209.9378	5263.8592	3.727562	2.4495031	-0.6057	-0.810225250927	0.657132712	6027	5157	5385.2922	5591.6423	2.4447819	2.442444	-0.0014	-0.14495365536	0.999043713	2593	2246	2333.8583	2491.5579	1.2835319	1.2056505	-0.0903	-0.219921775592	0.939322614	12101	9783	10673.439	10407.046	4.0839476	3.8712145	-0.0772	-0.109491110313	0.947909915	2131	1638	1921.0313	1833.0923	0.8647347	0.7979797	-0.1159	-0.216785059739	0.92280316	2440	2336	2198.7963	2592.3908	0.9765914	1.0489636	0.1031	-0.0846219646806	1.07410717	1573	1061	1416.3716	1209.5508	0.5474636	0.4765921	-0.2000	-0.0370760102354	0.870545718	4630	2578	4135.8884	2856.4435	1.7319457	1.1349961	-0.6097	-0.544816530908	0.6553319	2281	1641	2057.1768	1836.3179	0.8508759	0.7733373	-0.1379	-0.182712534558	0.90887220	3328	2085	2986.6947	2312.7927	1.1139832	0.9227453	-0.2717	-0.280270993138	0.8283297!sample_table_end
