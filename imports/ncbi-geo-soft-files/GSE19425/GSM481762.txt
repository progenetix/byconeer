Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481762/suppl/GSM481762_JBH532.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1574	1520	1579.7806	1514.7413	0.8143798	0.7825587	-0.0575	0.0995893023378	0.96092592	1594	2213	1599.2754	2179.6481	1.0468553	1.2504966	0.2564	0.0958003597647	1.19452673	1247	1181	1252.048	1193.9329	0.6403916	0.6517509	0.0254	0.169672988699	1.0177384	11319	8420	10901.104	8014.7467	5.1974089	4.2222852	-0.2998	0.0756161441926	0.81238275	16166	14223	15263.937	13305.345	8.9106901	8.0774815	-0.1416	-0.0940339025283	0.90649336	6871	6616	6756.2674	6324.2137	3.9038358	3.8619673	-0.0156	-0.0112752400329	0.9892757	2033	1925	2045.5561	1902.3534	1.3608281	1.2110863	-0.1682	-0.0713138707804	0.88996278	2224	2164	2233.8653	2131.9362	1.0058131	1.0628601	0.0796	0.040084996706	1.05671729	1731	1838	1737.7421	1821.0018	1.1063951	0.9891812	-0.1616	-0.0160232187502	0.894057810	9083	8502	8832.9522	8090.9142	4.4694612	4.2597447	-0.0693	-0.0205485420556	0.953077911	7961	7709	7791.5449	7348.0426	3.5630645	3.7297612	0.0660	0.0109648355262	1.046784612	6306	5103	6220.8954	4906.4563	3.0066758	2.4891318	-0.2725	0.10178331419	0.827868313	1704	1944	1709.5948	1920.0925	0.8830765	0.9471576	0.1011	0.0649276764992	1.072565614	4674	5381	4633.0885	5167.6917	3.9381857	3.6266778	-0.1189	-0.166015985436	0.920900615	1734	1630	1740.8705	1621.2049	0.7562875	0.7619344	0.0107	0.11815769463	1.007466616	1510	1863	1517.9198	1844.4001	0.7458898	0.9470129	0.3444	0.063455587998	1.269641917	326	318	289.38376	363.92624	0.1804562	0.2095671	0.2158	0.014615525977	1.161318418	2383	2485	2396.7168	2442.9648	1.5938932	1.5566702	-0.0341	0.119019055029	0.976646419	696	915	693.55367	938.79429	0.4269334	0.5109251	0.2591	0.14117745186	1.196732420	1776	1421	1784.7367	1419.8973	0.8990031	0.7231492	-0.3140	0.0601013539857	0.8043901!sample_table_end
