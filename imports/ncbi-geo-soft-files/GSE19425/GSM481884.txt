Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481884/suppl/GSM481884_MR298.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6731	4089	6184.8228	4131.1225	1.7941006	1.3685046	-0.3907	0.0819006421854	0.76278032	12087	6321	10225.952	6413.375	1.3510633	1.2983997	-0.0574	0.0770416913243	0.96102063	3224	2072	3219.7831	2099.5873	1.1187454	0.7342363	-0.6076	-0.090697127888	0.65630334	13984	10621	11600.824	10720.999	3.4678845	3.1704181	-0.1294	-0.0997083950961	0.91422255	13629	13994	11346.354	14142.842	4.2699721	4.7442541	0.1520	-0.138390717789	1.11107386	5062	5981	4816.6024	6062.1673	1.8744939	2.4157501	0.3660	-0.0753736324478	1.28874797	1319	2186	1392.8451	2211.2811	0.6566154	0.7005858	0.0935	-0.0579220756604	1.06696518	3001	2835	3012.6009	2868.344	0.8507771	0.8214678	-0.0506	-0.0256678472839	0.965559	14481	8081	11955.634	8165.4846	1.4990223	1.5384678	0.0375	-0.062691950662	1.026314210	9971	9697	8637.1627	9792.2758	2.3121923	2.6693809	0.2072	-0.201567461216	1.154480511	21971	16285	17206.905	16525.593	4.3165105	4.4558743	0.0458	-0.103588372538	1.032286212	9873	7381	8563.0853	7484.4354	3.1226505	2.1971647	-0.5071	-0.179574947568	0.703621713	4231	4628	4098.7784	4688.5157	1.7119751	1.5356741	-0.1568	-0.104769732413	0.89701914	26738	12728	20443.997	12853.598	3.4139012	3.2055097	-0.0909	-0.162748093698	0.93895815	4325	3581	4181.8324	3615.821	1.0954035	0.8902123	-0.2992	-0.0103760233642	0.812679816	2562	3196	2599.8729	3230.1324	0.958791	0.9056263	-0.0823	-0.105236287123	0.944550217	4782	2344	4577.8103	2374.0569	0.6752225	0.5345445	-0.3371	-0.0338940205176	0.791656818	2858	2556	2874.2615	2587.7384	1.6089398	1.4485638	-0.1515	-0.0822973069082	0.900321919	8586	4107	7605.2495	4149.4869	1.0855418	0.9394723	-0.2085	-0.0579120587186	0.865440920	4205	2694	4075.7729	2725.8246	1.0264476	0.7636089	-0.4268	-0.0183001416846	0.7439336!sample_table_end
