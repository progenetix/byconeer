Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481590/suppl/GSM481590_EL652.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3955	3400	4178.0374	3169.6413	1.1062855	0.8315953	-0.4118	-0.159644120735	0.75170042	3383	3808	3589.3457	3550.4393	1.3648391	1.1542106	-0.2418	-0.111578524778	0.84567523	2762	1976	2949.0427	1847.2748	0.6604012	0.541814	-0.2855	-0.23675112141	0.82043164	20963	16027	20284.088	15618.209	4.6531886	4.1362697	-0.1699	-0.111595873233	0.88891085	13266	18583	13286.363	18278.527	4.3131178	6.3940668	0.5680	-0.139368696679	1.48246976	14945	10542	14853.919	10032.727	3.5866152	3.1109409	-0.2053	-0.0707399814642	0.86737517	2113	3429	2269.6366	3196.3936	1.1656939	1.4088183	0.2733	-0.163540958853	1.20856628	3236	3103	3433.5362	2900.5766	0.8762602	0.7706934	-0.1852	-0.0882298149578	0.87952579	3006	3568	3195.9242	3324.5857	1.1992124	1.0571296	-0.1819	-0.00781885838297	0.881519910	15718	16022	15564.932	15613.131	5.0246526	4.9273062	-0.0282	-0.124215817198	0.980626211	10687	6630	10837.087	6237.0831	3.2383292	1.8834546	-0.7819	-0.753022268625	0.58161312	6119	5352	6374.3197	5017.4953	2.6794244	1.9642029	-0.4480	-0.401252959831	0.733068913	2195	2254	2356.9504	2106.2917	0.986085	0.7996391	-0.3024	-0.27770898068	0.810923114	5256	5816	5501.5878	5456.3435	2.2317126	1.936687	-0.2046	-0.232688201439	0.86780315	1862	1958	2004.0612	1830.8106	0.7439734	0.6376863	-0.2224	-0.174411373886	0.857135916	1612	2168	1744.2823	2025.4233	0.719998	0.7673577	0.0919	-0.161172816303	1.065777517	590	610	624.2126	611.7975	0.2178561	0.189764	-0.1992	-0.0306665986741	0.871052218	5077	5096	5319.5171	4771.4776	1.5841241	1.5038661	-0.0750	-0.00168936029305	0.94933619	2366	2559	2537.9387	2389.1597	0.9081519	0.776164	-0.2266	-0.227364854176	0.854663220	3284	2763	3484.4117	2578.8767	1.1604543	0.8876608	-0.3866	-0.129010537873	0.7649253!sample_table_end
