Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481942/suppl/GSM481942_MR368.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4470	5130	4380.2622	5211.2233	1.6590468	1.9296428	0.2180	0.0931204048992	1.16310332	2793	3552	2788.9971	3587.9494	1.0555403	1.3647726	0.3707	-0.0366979295174	1.29296113	2652	2792	2655.921	2791.7434	1.0999017	1.1256377	0.0334	-0.0326356419934	1.02339854	10197	9529	9856.6899	9695.1255	4.3651781	4.222723	-0.0479	-0.232813804195	0.96736565	12801	12113	12368.79	12322.214	5.2616424	5.119323	-0.0396	-0.162411506961	0.97295156	3465	2783	3424.0403	2782.3091	1.7049656	1.3463077	-0.3407	-0.0361712385895	0.78963927	1564	1614	1624.2056	1548.3195	0.644484	0.5969861	-0.1104	-0.0685775516143	0.92630088	1074	1296	1158.0407	1218.0258	0.4820882	0.5011862	0.0560	-0.0645417458092	1.0396159	2656	2698	2659.6913	2693.2727	0.9651017	0.9880274	0.0339	-0.0540366406778	1.023754710	10456	8512	10106.18	8660.5464	4.2646869	3.7869695	-0.1714	-0.0781522322417	0.88798311	6112	4795	5953.9641	4869.2769	2.4287663	2.0221855	-0.2643	-0.18324080103	0.832597812	8306	8476	8042.8857	8624.2403	3.2251257	3.4372787	0.0919	-0.145158523035	1.065781313	4064	3823	3992.5782	3866.7661	1.5175794	1.5273498	0.0093	0.118000967954	1.006438114	6672	8192	6484.1797	8337.4204	2.6335764	3.3915502	0.3649	-0.215043270326	1.287811615	3481	3331	3439.2254	3353.5059	1.2944181	1.2876821	-0.0075	0.0829119624538	0.99479616	2387	2832	2405.705	2833.4038	0.972038	1.1352177	0.2239	-0.108847351379	1.167873817	650	772	735.9179	696.8375	0.2885257	0.2737075	-0.0761	0.0475117262284	0.948641518	5357	5112	5229.0008	5192.7238	1.989904	1.9034373	-0.0641	0.0739843005384	0.956547319	1542	1473	1603.1717	1401.1973	0.655496	0.5870758	-0.1590	0.0716255312556	0.895620720	1725	1898	1778.0399	1848.6353	0.7754478	0.8365652	0.1094	-0.0804689032681	1.0788156!sample_table_end
