Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481891/suppl/GSM481891_MR305.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4239	4833	4259.2637	4774.4181	1.4015296	1.6162303	-0.2056	-0.0545167514877	0.86715962	3034	3011	3084.6222	2961.0522	1.2186237	1.177696	0.0493	0.0141055851372	1.03475233	3865	3111	3895.8932	3058.3358	1.0865445	0.863303	0.3318	0.00558941212475	1.25858994	19133	16679	18241.661	16579.153	4.2425355	3.9590024	0.0998	-0.113717026687	1.07161735	21160	21383	20128.751	21207.79	5.7949287	6.1148881	-0.0775	-0.205225778399	0.94767536	13973	9739	13447.518	9686.004	4.3046305	3.1459489	0.4524	0.184255789028	1.36830917	4400	3676	4418.69	3621.9021	1.1353305	0.8527946	0.4128	0.182559334648	1.3313068	4288	4722	4307.8721	4661.3598	0.9068959	1.0174638	-0.1660	-0.0411318370603	0.89132999	3266	4153	3309.4933	4092.1699	1.1640835	1.461961	-0.3287	-0.112773702244	0.79624810	14213	13749	13672.709	13674.522	3.1047139	3.3943908	-0.1287	-0.153567887296	0.914660111	17105	17979	16377.501	17876.335	3.6928006	4.2839404	-0.2142	-0.171525514909	0.862010312	16290	14672	15607.057	14588.709	3.511019	3.109788	0.1751	-0.114847346846	1.12902213	5210	6153	5188.0808	6093.2171	1.269199	1.5307223	-0.2703	-0.151051164721	0.829150514	5627	7888	5589.7869	7811.5441	3.5280541	4.4710732	-0.3417	-0.287374269911	0.789084415	3771	3947	3806.4762	3886.4379	0.7792862	0.8041289	-0.0453	-0.01846614814	0.969106116	3058	4232	3107.8547	4170.7163	0.6830113	0.8524396	-0.3197	-0.142206643047	0.80124317	1230	1119	1271.3145	1131.4359	0.5123241	0.4680257	0.1305	0.103989834503	1.094649518	3241	2992	3285.2139	2942.7285	1.7911323	1.4356279	0.3192	0.161319906437	1.247629919	2090	2419	2148.8017	2384.8402	0.7886576	0.9117914	-0.2093	-0.11417658432	0.864953920	3925	3733	3952.9032	3676.7185	0.8129914	0.8343292	-0.0374	-0.097280947977	0.9744252!sample_table_end
