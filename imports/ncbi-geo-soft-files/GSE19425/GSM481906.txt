Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481906/suppl/GSM481906_MR320.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	9957	6443	9554.5886	6549.1983	1.5267694	1.0991924	-0.4740	0.0560755825592	0.71994662	7931	7469	7673.9897	7597.6884	1.2598847	1.2924825	0.0369	0.0771270316751	1.02587363	9189	6110	8839.795	6208.1117	1.4840848	1.0987419	-0.4337	-0.0570824858883	0.74034984	16013	14025	15149.443	14394.536	2.4634854	2.5164224	0.0307	-0.0645502398279	1.02148875	22175	17049	20861.3	17556.274	3.8338495	3.3320494	-0.2024	-0.0601340682252	0.86911336	12850	13284	12244.396	13619.781	2.1438781	2.5040981	0.2241	-0.0993200943421	1.16802267	3908	4511	3911.2607	4569.5272	0.7892958	0.8423378	0.0938	0.111142315487	1.06720188	4755	4096	4710.4449	4137.0048	0.7813684	0.7192577	-0.1195	-0.0434511156049	0.92051049	13880	12863	13197.056	13175.803	2.0443705	2.1046264	0.0419	-0.105602853062	1.029474110	14446	15952	13717.586	16406.156	2.9924281	3.4525964	0.2064	-0.297382932418	1.153777511	39790	31582	37018.414	32991.934	7.2159204	6.5778192	-0.1336	-0.0922700847095	0.911570412	13049	10187	12428.656	10417.373	2.3447879	1.9885208	-0.2378	-0.0478741221069	0.8480613	9176	8588	8827.7648	8755.0328	2.1153195	1.9507988	-0.1168	-0.176558757265	0.922224214	21601	18438	20328.358	18992.908	3.4450999	3.3498447	-0.0405	-0.105141486831	0.972350515	8804	7833	8482.578	7976.4759	1.563305	1.4478383	-0.1107	-0.0886995805047	0.926139416	7237	6729	7031.5866	6841.0342	1.2760538	1.2261661	-0.0575	-0.104479470609	0.960904717	4997	4492	4939.4189	4550.1065	0.80269	0.7680621	-0.0636	-0.0943825692234	0.956860118	10374	10775	9942.9727	11014.719	1.7327448	1.9466417	0.1679	-0.0404274444923	1.12344419	8180	7366	7907.3635	7490.3478	1.3625046	1.3114366	-0.0551	-0.217546192195	0.96251920	3711	2695	3724.336	2690.2231	0.769288	0.5401259	-0.5102	-0.0307287013028	0.7021115!sample_table_end
