Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481889/suppl/GSM481889_MR303.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4563	4095	4535.6925	4096.9494	1.2611442	1.0895729	0.2110	0.153783679281	1.15746652	6040	4873	5993.2725	4879.3502	1.9939918	1.5204308	0.3912	0.185052572313	1.3114653	3640	2753	3632.3936	2756.6252	0.8667609	0.6391752	0.4394	0.0593965364432	1.35606134	20465	16877	19655.832	17233	4.608382	4.0399683	0.1899	-0.0686537295815	1.14069755	20338	19156	19536.824	19575.915	5.4475944	5.2551809	0.0519	-0.140518681973	1.0366146	11093	13045	10830.216	13253.599	2.665773	3.2282234	-0.2762	-0.180034545693	0.82577097	3406	4078	3398.0844	4080.222	0.8200452	1.0002808	-0.2866	-0.167176628749	0.81981498	4601	4353	4572.1383	4353.6293	0.9986658	1.0135976	-0.0214	0.0311468676074	0.98526849	3189	3770	3181.1245	3776.3101	0.9974666	1.1039176	-0.1463	-0.0215646245767	0.903569710	14281	11738	13834.815	11896.628	3.8081618	3.5699179	0.0932	-0.0426197839577	1.066736511	15561	13142	15037.686	13355.701	3.9296366	3.7847419	0.0542	-0.0373135213469	1.038283912	15128	11843	14631.526	12004.305	3.4175491	2.9894553	0.1931	-0.105844420296	1.143201213	3963	3553	3951.5237	3560.116	1.1596653	1.1221404	0.0475	0.00782354711909	1.033440514	12099	11689	11775.298	11846.394	4.1650407	3.8096315	0.1287	-0.0521604385027	1.093292215	3672	3099	3663.904	3108.3972	0.8337043	0.7486258	0.1553	0.0818159926985	1.113646116	3422	3188	3414.0822	3197.5338	0.7948476	0.7622952	0.0603	0.047801776963	1.042703217	928	858	933.2691	885.7242	0.3065748	0.2825144	0.1179	0.0977125906759	1.08516518	6978	6779	6885.2075	6800.3733	1.7665938	1.601748	0.1413	0.0723864211162	1.102916119	1949	1810	1952.9996	1823.8739	0.6775043	0.6093239	0.1530	0.0669861903413	1.11189520	3619	2823	3611.3582	2826.5149	0.8512729	0.7275791	0.2265	0.0346662054204	1.1700074!sample_table_end
