Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481849/suppl/GSM481849_MR241.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4320	4619	4453.0744	4445.3393	1.6367265	1.6400307	-0.0029	-0.0834126372659	0.99798522	3159	2967	3318.8582	2795.0134	1.151029	0.9536317	0.2714	0.381578305648	1.20699533	4932	4609	5050.6837	4435.1425	1.7710875	1.6265594	0.1228	-0.0776726574542	1.0888554	6663	5904	6731.7374	5731.3783	2.6127253	2.3172167	0.1732	0.19640699162	1.12752745	9249	7563	9290.2669	7377.3298	3.2707122	2.6825134	0.2860	0.246415019463	1.21927156	5265	5368	5368.9287	5201.3229	1.9224705	1.9582317	-0.0266	-0.101977779737	0.98173797	1778	2091	1929.2444	1941.3527	0.55045	0.5648634	-0.0373	-0.0409970284404	0.97448338	1149	1605	1265.8455	1479.2933	0.4789189	0.5787568	-0.2732	-0.208913272121	0.82749599	5936	7040	6011.5388	6857.704	1.9485155	2.1889063	-0.1678	-0.195291791124	0.890177610	12347	12965	12351.71	12741.948	4.6785311	4.8882365	-0.0633	-0.0657558415348	0.957099911	15406	18418	15354.252	18274.727	5.9328179	7.2658093	-0.2924	-0.338756526555	0.816539112	6270	6661	6341.789	6478.3139	1.925965	2.0245942	-0.0721	0.0372881713875	0.951284413	9476	11253	9514.9248	11031.518	2.901587	3.344627	-0.2050	-0.206180358669	0.867536814	9664	9664	9700.3231	9455.6834	3.1050654	2.9784456	0.0601	0.028351741475	1.04251215	7632	7628	7696.7179	7442.2708	2.3864189	2.3954803	-0.0055	-0.00598834243441	0.996217316	5209	6149	5315.5159	5970.9318	1.539186	1.7736895	-0.2046	-0.164262655705	0.867787717	2673	3151	2839.3574	2977.4832	0.9868494	1.0317971	-0.0643	-0.233247946031	0.956437418	4326	5963	4459.0069	5789.3177	1.3029526	1.7315547	-0.4103	-0.352805627162	0.752475519	4601	5277	4729.7606	5109.5519	1.6884578	1.8082114	-0.0989	-0.173925341565	0.933772320	1987	2403	2143.976	2241.5896	0.7568044	0.8009969	-0.0819	-0.222353906702	0.9448281!sample_table_end
