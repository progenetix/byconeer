Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481596/suppl/GSM481596_EL658.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3334	2495	3293.4484	2505.4135	1.2092973	0.9275109	-0.3827	-0.124529327949	0.76698332	2214	2196	2191.1851	2208.7783	1.1719885	0.9988578	-0.2306	0.031253743115	0.8522763	1727	1288	1703.5202	1317.7965	0.6456939	0.52883	-0.2880	-0.261452169895	0.81901044	15739	12974	15258.611	12983.475	4.9872466	4.569531	-0.1262	-0.0767272684967	0.91624325	14047	18983	13654.909	19090.333	6.9946095	9.712363	0.4736	0.0136802108905	1.38854976	10505	11933	10269.109	11932.079	4.1301515	5.0186951	0.2811	0.262468036873	1.21513587	1670	2469	1647.6966	2479.482	1.2577486	1.701391	0.4359	0.149263658454	1.35272738	2635	2448	2603.3092	2458.5354	0.8965066	0.8945384	-0.0032	-0.138453411052	0.99780459	2319	2628	2295.4303	2636.1862	1.2050491	1.1489251	-0.0688	0.025889050611	0.953425910	14963	14042	14531.694	14055.778	6.4940994	6.5346881	0.0090	-0.0810733980892	1.0062511	6497	5568	6370.2602	5555.4608	2.6122736	2.4079781	-0.1175	-0.125096166515	0.92179412	5278	3932	5185.3849	3933.8366	3.1361344	2.399514	-0.3862	-0.27673506613	0.765118313	1630	1315	1608.6193	1344.0639	0.9690167	0.7910217	-0.2928	-0.244331678962	0.816313714	4519	4072	4449.3898	4074.4632	2.5948226	2.0090767	-0.3691	-0.148784443174	0.774263615	1263	958	1239.4112	997.4875	0.6484438	0.5415494	-0.2599	-0.158325994632	0.835152416	1155	1145	1131.5034	1179.7948	0.6903667	0.6681656	-0.0472	-0.256732308278	0.967841417	454	302	395.8779	364.5873	0.194581	0.1616742	-0.2673	-0.114502758427	0.830883818	5248	4507	5156.1773	4510.4454	2.2850218	2.0125976	-0.1831	-0.059597565295	0.880778219	1505	1729	1484.0071	1749.3708	0.7676169	0.7779092	0.0192	-0.136719425805	1.013408120	2476	1837	2448.7368	1856.2831	1.1901553	0.9645641	-0.3032	-0.146289168538	0.8104523!sample_table_end
