Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481808/suppl/GSM481808_MR060.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4917	5089	4854.0554	5129.8339	1.3099983	1.2994581	-0.0117	0.0644945405798	0.9919542	3697	4120	3701.8361	4112.855	1.0240048	1.05457	0.0424	-0.0279153246942	1.02984863	3871	3396	3866.3715	3371.0969	1.0902249	0.942071	-0.2107	0.0345683153796	0.86410714	11155	9599	10538.19	9950.6468	2.9992001	2.8559987	-0.0706	-0.0256475808486	0.95225345	14817	9896	13879.311	10269.236	3.9153542	2.9291638	-0.4187	-0.224981225557	0.74812226	7956	7880	7642.4243	8100.8355	2.2766922	2.3566886	0.0498	0.0242500252755	1.03513717	2714	2512	2758.6042	2481.4182	0.6799779	0.614456	-0.1462	-0.205459049354	0.9036418	2298	2664	2346.5304	2632.1794	0.6039448	0.7024661	0.2180	0.105073923423	1.16312959	5754	5669	5634.2944	5744.6703	1.475248	1.4123714	-0.0628	-0.0362029408412	0.957378910	12776	10123	12003.916	10513.867	2.9647625	2.709664	-0.1298	-0.119432198756	0.913956511	20743	14007	19272.694	14659.907	4.7908822	3.8567051	-0.3129	-0.166560145401	0.805009312	7864	9304	7559.5993	9637.6018	1.8425234	2.4375602	0.4038	0.200525194596	1.322946613	8712	7904	8324.3192	8126.7032	2.027157	1.978753	-0.0349	-0.0416770186524	0.976122214	10996	10997	10393.666	11445.775	2.9210095	2.8689131	-0.0260	0.00711482306751	0.982164915	5969	5908	5832.3261	5997.2233	1.3457178	1.4477664	0.1055	0.118105454297	1.07583216	4194	4562	4175.0939	4579.6268	0.9921214	1.1283033	0.1856	0.0490510642208	1.137263417	1895	1731	1953.2231	1711.3313	0.5373623	0.4390692	-0.2914	-0.139947056083	0.817082118	5542	6224	5438.5555	6332.1196	1.4709949	1.5701323	0.0941	0.0530194182137	1.067394719	4177	4035	4158.7176	4022.7796	1.1606767	1.0697574	-0.1177	-0.0349884127092	0.92166720	2438	2290	2485.7716	2261.3197	0.6485039	0.6204909	-0.0637	-0.101408001616	0.9568036!sample_table_end
