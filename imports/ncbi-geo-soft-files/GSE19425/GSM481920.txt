Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481920/suppl/GSM481920_MR344.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2094	1430	1947.0913	1568.8034	1.0769487	0.8581857	-0.3276	-0.118091102391	0.79686782	4073	3692	3952.3793	3719.2178	2.3618751	2.25056	-0.0696	0.0358856823488	0.952873	2578	1912	2436.5129	2021.1724	1.2362927	1.0287587	-0.2651	-0.115477159712	0.8321324	6821	7119	6622.9929	7133.8155	3.5313407	3.840561	0.1211	-0.202855321535	1.08756465	9395	8810	9046.9309	8860.6255	5.5974459	5.3371609	-0.0687	-0.289354767107	0.95349936	6183	7024	6012.9035	7038.2755	3.286639	3.8837794	0.2408	0.0298267188804	1.18168737	1208	1098	1040.8123	1240.7215	0.8058284	0.9431757	0.2271	0.0795053664848	1.17044248	1778	1753	1619.2866	1872.9022	0.9457848	1.1029098	0.2217	0.0471079589277	1.16613199	2266	1363	2119.486	1504.1623	1.2016108	0.8662382	-0.4721	-0.0872330382337	0.720897510	5815	5037	5658.4721	5044.7867	3.6436295	3.2789734	-0.1521	-0.0569622970732	0.899919611	3553	3406	3431.7946	3446.4849	2.2271625	2.2474676	0.0131	-0.203565212419	1.00911712	2709	3174	2570.3567	3226.4102	1.936997	2.39812	0.3081	-0.312106265898	1.238060813	1735	1264	1571.9852	1405.5115	1.3235653	1.1733821	-0.1738	-0.101826667379	0.886531314	5173	4412	5034.5591	4421.0378	3.8185051	3.29825	-0.2113	-0.294141640227	0.863754215	1268	950	1093.4511	1096.9982	0.7725997	0.7496313	-0.0435	-0.0551430231191	0.970271416	1491	1140	1302.3667	1280.8457	0.9567256	0.9211741	-0.0546	-0.17877000685	0.962840417	2063	1556	1915.7531	1687.3152	1.1137524	0.988721	-0.1718	0.141897700679	0.887738618	2897	2230	2764.7579	2323.6645	1.9173652	1.5965007	-0.2642	0.0783443598497	0.832653419	1591	1190	1410.7656	1330.2376	0.8155571	0.776314	-0.0711	-0.164716753964	0.951881920	1981	1249	1830.7853	1390.2063	1.058453	0.8217966	-0.3651	-0.16881258056	0.7764129!sample_table_end
