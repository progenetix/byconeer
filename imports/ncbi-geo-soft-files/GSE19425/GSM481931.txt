Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481931/suppl/GSM481931_MR357.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3842	3871	3786.4327	3926.7075	1.0714746	1.1152811	-0.0578	0.0193936321895	0.96072152	4791	4253	4693.8619	4320.6473	1.342001	1.2643319	0.0860	0.032468066372	1.06143093	4181	3185	4111.6157	3231.6052	1.1689136	0.9118086	0.3584	0.018868005658	1.28197254	11120	10912	10622.807	11058.588	2.6364351	2.737496	-0.0543	-0.190746092817	0.96308275	15606	15432	14866.234	15546.789	4.6967337	4.9989432	-0.0900	-0.211440801124	0.93954536	9479	7814	9112.8275	7935.6704	2.7449945	2.4174911	0.1833	0.0497050611215	1.13547247	3146	2842	3115.0861	2881.4233	0.933102	0.873638	0.0950	0.0236377488931	1.06806478	3720	4095	3670.5454	4159.0389	0.7992931	0.9028408	-0.1757	-0.046021000052	0.8853099	4929	4942	4820.513	5006.7071	1.2983114	1.3886609	-0.0971	0.00305254071289	0.934937610	16171	13982	15413.774	14123.608	3.0665564	2.8797046	0.0907	-0.0438723449418	1.064885711	23029	29985	22093.492	29618.628	4.7226923	6.3029842	-0.4164	-0.272626762717	0.749278712	10897	10776	10415.426	10920.791	2.5062281	2.6304009	-0.0698	-0.237266647343	0.952793113	7253	8000	7013.9322	8122.0777	1.5650082	1.8562661	-0.2462	-0.139020775569	0.843094714	9358	10246	8999.3017	10387.433	3.2906923	3.997444	-0.2807	-0.256843387011	0.82319915	5631	5317	5491.848	5390.4562	1.186219	1.172649	0.0166	0.0124701306697	1.01157216	3493	4365	3453.8751	4430.5979	0.8453837	1.0799354	-0.3533	-0.158995957075	0.782809417	2094	2033	2103.338	2064.3157	0.5948846	0.5986415	-0.0091	0.034214165567	0.993724418	5221	4912	5099.373	4976.1799	1.739865	1.6987702	0.0345	0.0189671091657	1.024190919	3773	3834	3720.903	3888.1061	0.9979389	1.0727044	-0.1042	-0.0616387118741	0.930301920	3399	3533	3362.3669	3580.9348	0.6060401	0.6455762	-0.0912	-0.124179762168	0.9387583!sample_table_end
