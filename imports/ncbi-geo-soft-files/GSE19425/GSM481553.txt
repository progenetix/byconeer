Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481553/suppl/GSM481553_EL175.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5088	4231	5040.7518	4125.945	3.7518437	3.0341101	0.3063	-0.000780492696633	1.23655492	701	773	721.7741	757.9538	0.437276	0.4693275	-0.1021	-0.146512015372	0.93170773	2040	2362	2071.1741	2301.1158	2.0021855	2.1222778	-0.0840	-0.222168070849	0.94341354	3366	3225	3360.8184	3141.9981	2.8290777	2.5824393	0.1316	0.00528499874843	1.0955065	13830	16641	13203.539	16130.497	11.426949	13.362569	-0.2258	-0.363596103452	0.85514626	2629	2806	2648.9811	2731.3074	2.8111615	2.8361755	-0.0128	0.0442854147496	0.99118047	1175	1400	1210.9624	1362.4159	0.9423061	1.0409235	-0.1436	-0.0318925220077	0.90525988	896	1208	928.7959	1174.3779	0.6706228	0.8412285	-0.3270	-0.353182259143	0.79719459	5934	6072	5850.9165	5910.8986	3.193215	3.2742167	-0.0361	-0.00859237499654	0.975260710	6090	6368	5999.7232	6197.6117	3.8660174	4.0687904	-0.0738	-0.0100843267993	0.950163811	19977	23588	18719.379	22748.602	12.855664	15.731882	-0.2913	-0.225763701263	0.817172712	6010	6433	5923.4318	6260.4315	4.1590486	4.4136828	-0.0857	-0.300307018715	0.94230813	5192	7306	5140.8875	7114.9205	2.7952704	3.9636154	-0.5038	-0.351717595273	0.705232514	15618	18178	14824.695	17606.91	11.125234	12.963088	-0.2206	-0.296533745812	0.85822415	2538	2771	2562.4818	2696.9958	1.7047837	1.7915338	-0.0716	0.0805627083766	0.951577716	3114	4295	3117.7609	4188.8893	2.1491276	2.7951422	-0.3792	-0.108334277248	0.768879517	1352	1524	1388.4778	1483.4418	0.856838	0.942905	-0.1381	-0.141837710291	0.908721518	2595	3079	2616.5695	2999.0649	2.0905818	2.4159677	-0.2087	-0.204106140526	0.865318619	2941	3064	2949.3056	2984.3714	1.8811817	1.9836389	-0.0765	-0.0452719674039	0.948348920	2502	2561	2528.2938	2494.0648	1.360509	1.4305037	-0.0724	-0.108303748984	0.9510699!sample_table_end
