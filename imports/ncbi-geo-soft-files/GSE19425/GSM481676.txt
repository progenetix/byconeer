Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481676/suppl/GSM481676_JA926.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5214	4219	5054.4566	4251.8125	1.6758908	1.4009214	-0.2586	-0.0432043267344	0.83592642	2469	2268	2403.8141	2312.3671	0.8659603	0.8036384	-0.1078	-0.0896152076689	0.92803143	4162	3427	4044.5023	3465.3138	1.2774199	1.1159112	-0.1950	-0.0470872798751	0.87356654	5009	2921	4856.1529	2965.045	1.9931803	1.2268969	-0.7001	-0.406730512602	0.61554745	14246	9040	13891.864	9030.8716	4.3626193	2.8722254	-0.6030	-0.366522047547	0.65837186	9011	8182	8765.0412	8184.4841	2.7200347	2.5888619	-0.0713	0.0460770859758	0.95177537	1396	1189	1365.6732	1224.9886	0.8168668	0.7685998	-0.0879	0.162139382495	0.9409128	1485	1208	1454.0275	1244.3321	0.7383359	0.639878	-0.2065	-0.188515948281	0.8666499	4820	5025	4674.9069	5049.2726	1.6443111	1.6915318	0.0408	0.0296766319385	1.028717610	3514	4121	3423.7562	4152.2065	2.6551366	3.0897814	0.2187	0.042249573246	1.163699611	8580	7347	8346.5295	7355.4815	6.0936466	5.3728741	-0.1816	-0.130556705547	0.881717412	1874	1413	1830.0827	1452.9754	1.2570148	1.0148495	-0.3087	-0.31292280589	0.807348913	1968	2145	1920.4524	2190.1258	1.8008945	2.0411206	0.1806	-0.0242353591929	1.133392714	10870	8966	10588.61	8957.0385	3.1498587	2.4699991	-0.3508	-0.228595022477	0.784161915	2625	2714	2557.4684	2755.9076	1.6026415	1.7724199	0.1453	0.0588894417531	1.105936616	1752	1832	1711.5516	1874.6605	1.066729	1.1991036	0.1688	-0.0781835912104	1.124093917	2255	2344	2197.724	2387.9046	0.7773349	0.822377	0.0813	0.0424130674637	1.057944318	5445	5628	5279.2983	5646.1657	1.4605227	1.5242601	0.0616	-0.0234578844174	1.043640119	3102	3211	3022.806	3253.1141	1.3969524	1.4516383	0.0554	-0.057946344881	1.039146620	691	550	676.1588	584.4442	0.5626479	0.4709866	-0.2565	-0.0845005763472	0.8370893!sample_table_end
