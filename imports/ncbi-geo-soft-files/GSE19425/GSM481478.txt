Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481478/suppl/GSM481478_DE385.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3017	2808	2885.511	2901.5657	1.1968477	1.2547074	0.0681	0.105235145435	1.04834332	1982	2566	1875.5529	2658.7936	1.1028865	1.4469288	0.3917	0.434275399693	1.3119473	2630	2393	2509.6175	2483.1961	1.3156446	1.3941121	0.0836	0.232462694931	1.05964174	6859	6021	6526.6586	6145.5415	2.9798483	3.0820635	0.0487	0.122114879332	1.03430215	12648	12606	11908.013	12981.159	6.5581569	7.1088252	0.1163	0.00226671205993	1.08396696	4877	4283	4665.0154	4392.9839	2.6267044	2.6147172	-0.0066	-0.0451568073427	0.99543637	1260	1117	1170.8022	1208.7039	1.075088	0.9676511	-0.1519	-0.113205432654	0.90006698	1641	1547	1544.5374	1636.7703	0.6266063	0.6969716	0.1535	0.0386315714235	1.11229589	1709	1728	1609.7211	1816.0253	0.9289278	0.9607769	0.0486	0.1216317478	1.034285710	7781	7515	7390.8434	7670.6459	3.1598368	3.3470656	0.0830	0.140809406778	1.059252611	15956	14885	14907.633	15381.439	6.348499	6.8147065	0.1022	0.0453052650987	1.073435812	2239	2049	2126.3969	2138.5318	1.6250834	1.4467635	-0.1677	-0.0903698862132	0.890270313	2870	3177	2744.7118	3276.7531	1.8811271	2.0593404	0.1306	0.0372409328908	1.094737514	4967	5568	4751.2212	5687.5248	2.9244385	3.2300965	0.1434	0.125931679223	1.104518415	2266	2688	2152.6228	2780.8992	1.2978948	1.5286116	0.2360	0.236945760098	1.177762216	1338	1621	1245.6251	1710.0131	0.972594	1.1812792	0.2804	0.182910401266	1.214565417	1421	1237	1327.4641	1326.8313	0.7071314	0.6742657	-0.0687	-0.0221946538043	0.953522518	2446	2663	2328.4916	2755.742	1.4547894	1.7380652	0.2567	0.138545953258	1.194719419	2084	2184	1976.004	2273.6066	1.018764	1.1340049	0.1546	0.0698092478811	1.113118320	1947	1520	1840.7434	1610.0205	0.7266946	0.6891797	-0.0765	0.13304553549	0.9483759!sample_table_end
