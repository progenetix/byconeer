Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481565/suppl/GSM481565_EL627.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1798	1940	1855.6777	1881.0207	0.735344	0.7492048	-0.0269	-0.170097148675	0.98149922	1672	1710	1727.3921	1659.0414	0.8091071	0.7571729	0.0957	-0.0714351247877	1.06858953	1695	1556	1750.9322	1511.4217	0.7064668	0.6128438	0.2051	0.152957884828	1.1527684	10662	13718	10596.47	13343.733	4.0332507	5.3452871	-0.4063	-0.325703477896	0.75454335	8489	23197	8509.2022	22922.015	4.1815644	9.7435012	-1.2204	-0.461541060133	0.42916446	9254	11282	9242.8903	10934.777	4.2473332	5.0461199	-0.2486	-0.283767730349	0.84170287	1648	2528	1702.9671	2443.1501	0.8561434	1.2239783	-0.5157	-0.266940841123	0.69947598	1383	1925	1436.1669	1866.5739	0.7520747	1.0261002	-0.4482	-0.279920487154	0.73294479	3524	3652	3599.6983	3525.7034	1.6637573	1.5702341	0.0835	-0.189914243423	1.0595610	12553	15861	12377.841	15495.012	5.0293559	6.5723382	-0.3860	-0.208141946581	0.765230811	5719	6038	5795.7036	5830.9635	2.7957394	2.9218647	-0.0637	-0.204581185949	0.956833912	6367	8176	6432.4249	7897.7244	2.8057233	3.4302959	-0.2900	-0.237240951699	0.817924513	1175	1242	1224.884	1212.0924	0.5987368	0.5872787	0.0279	0.138685262634	1.019510514	3792	5027	3862.9549	4861.2035	2.3501606	2.7170393	-0.2093	-0.241870041962	0.864971115	1090	1233	1137.5006	1203.5593	0.5901613	0.6417302	-0.1209	0.0338223018824	0.919640916	1490	1843	1545.2718	1787.6019	0.6515656	0.7527119	-0.2082	-0.00701241222714	0.865624217	427	400	443.5821	407.7312	0.2014981	0.1828218	0.1403	-0.00611506542391	1.102155718	3592	4128	3666.9487	3979.9227	1.6269978	1.6614658	-0.0302	-0.141209539807	0.979254519	1069	959	1116.0378	941.3184	0.5090686	0.4251377	0.2599	0.164607764154	1.197420420	2966	2992	3039.8565	2892.8816	1.0459003	1.061111	-0.0208	-0.144929679991	0.9856653!sample_table_end
