Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481566/suppl/GSM481566_EL628.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2738	2304	2766.409	2283.1463	0.9134189	0.7351422	-0.3133	-0.170097148675	0.80482482	3502	3150	3535.7847	3094.4839	1.3265918	1.124393	-0.2386	-0.0714351247877	0.84758023	1688	1863	1712.9004	1858.1304	0.5545054	0.5946393	0.1008	0.152957884828	1.07237794	11313	9582	11195.615	9338.4653	3.8448021	3.2441189	-0.2451	-0.325703477896	0.84376745	13236	16727	13014.814	16436.851	4.4799779	5.505246	0.2973	-0.461541060133	1.22885566	9107	7673	9084.5313	7462.7468	3.2671722	2.6191963	-0.3189	-0.283767730349	0.80167077	3130	3435	3163.8489	3370.9426	1.0806677	1.0670997	-0.0182	-0.266940841123	0.98744478	2561	2359	2586.2372	2335.5572	0.8566612	0.7928827	-0.1116	-0.279920487154	0.92554999	3607	2768	3642.2936	2726.7177	1.3170635	0.9553035	-0.4633	-0.189914243423	0.725328310	13041	12600	12830.707	12282.347	4.375215	4.2844294	-0.0303	-0.208141946581	0.9792511	13022	9775	12812.757	9524.1395	4.1607297	3.274634	-0.3455	-0.204581185949	0.787033512	7012	6287	7025.3194	6126.3304	2.3049749	2.0282414	-0.1845	-0.237240951699	0.879940713	1214	1516	1243.4252	1522.3182	0.3911422	0.4649858	0.2495	0.138685262634	1.188789714	8068	7237	8065.8603	7035.6247	3.143634	2.5990227	-0.2745	-0.241870041962	0.826757415	1455	1679	1481.974	1679.661	0.4680818	0.5334165	0.1885	0.0338223018824	1.139579716	2160	2439	2177.3223	2411.6556	0.6503928	0.7440882	0.1942	-0.00701241222714	1.144059717	508	451	519.6318	476.3178	0.190625	0.1714965	-0.1526	-0.00611506542391	0.899653718	4321	4034	4356.9106	3937.9167	1.4722294	1.2361276	-0.2522	-0.141209539807	0.839629719	946	1001	979.3392	1018.2244	0.3576924	0.3752899	0.0693	0.164607764154	1.04919720	2846	2374	2876.3633	2349.8335	0.9539287	0.7916443	-0.2690	-0.144929679991	0.8298778!sample_table_end
