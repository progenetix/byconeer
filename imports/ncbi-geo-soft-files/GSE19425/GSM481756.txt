Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481756/suppl/GSM481756_JBH526.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2247	2252	2286.4017	2191.464	0.9610098	0.9623492	0.0020	0.0667126445088	1.00139362	1845	2445	1870.5584	2372.1717	0.9096768	1.0807556	0.2486	0.165054586748	1.18806543	2021	1942	2053.7944	1901.8673	0.8687717	0.8672357	-0.0026	0.12124117336	0.99823194	11570	9228	11480.737	8835.9011	5.1416125	4.3771959	-0.2322	0.0356063157815	0.85132745	13992	14684	13808.993	14030.854	6.3593669	6.7688949	0.0900	0.0195537593103	1.06439766	8161	6498	8171.631	6222.0168	3.7099122	3.0248986	-0.2945	-0.287532881554	0.81535587	1381	1546	1396.4176	1524.9729	1.1914194	1.1186533	-0.0909	-0.0943581567313	0.93892488	1909	1573	1936.1987	1550.1663	0.986905	0.8547288	-0.2074	0.0050056810613	0.866079	2802	3195	2842.446	3079.3345	1.334528	1.3354413	0.0010	-0.00944280478698	1.000684310	4201	4217	4258.7885	4053.4492	2.7712867	2.8093205	0.0197	-0.0394008856709	1.013724211	5425	5755	5487.8795	5509.6264	3.2864242	3.6087409	0.1350	0.0659827974653	1.098075112	4054	4770	4110.4003	4580.5746	3.0651797	3.3516369	0.1289	0.360792498149	1.093455213	2017	1333	2049.6521	1324.3579	1.8333862	1.2057799	-0.6045	-0.394548867048	0.657679114	8153	9126	8163.9429	8737.8582	4.4258523	4.1367896	-0.0974	0.0200156798336	0.934687615	1230	1280	1243.2248	1275.0475	0.7889329	0.8767437	0.1523	0.111189599411	1.111303216	884	1284	889.4015	1278.7738	0.7059312	0.9174916	0.3782	0.168889095182	1.299689817	827	977	832.066	985.6887	0.3948936	0.4540186	0.2013	0.00440790616293	1.149723918	3559	3872	3609.8191	3723.1215	1.5566598	1.5486467	-0.0074	0.00175584510358	0.994852419	1119	1404	1129.9586	1391.122	0.6005416	0.6990539	0.2191	0.0529533613947	1.164039120	1554	1363	1575.0269	1352.5343	0.9064893	0.7562259	-0.2615	0.0231862148518	0.8342358!sample_table_end
