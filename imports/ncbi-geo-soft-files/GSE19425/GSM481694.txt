Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481694/suppl/GSM481694_JBH094.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	7519	8365	7777.0465	7988.8239	1.4231631	1.2316793	-0.2085	-0.160633119219	0.8654522	5946	7559	6185.0705	7230.9559	1.2799461	1.278809	-0.0013	0.0355098971299	0.99911163	6657	6294	6929.9039	6025.6759	1.1849308	1.0135919	-0.2253	-0.15991662008	0.85540184	8510	9833	8785.243	9391.5699	1.4787086	1.5149313	0.0349	-0.0073111153938	1.02449625	17917	18937	18292.338	18096.787	3.4098427	3.5541908	0.0598	0.0440980654489	1.04233286	12744	13985	13076.224	13348.685	2.3867068	2.4023384	0.0094	0.0172306736935	1.00654947	5440	5499	5660.2856	5267.9069	1.0158704	1.0671383	0.0710	0.0990607178788	1.05046698	4970	5388	5186.2702	5161.8107	0.7737793	0.7649014	-0.0166	0.0121839035205	0.98852659	12650	15348	12980.974	14634.428	2.5670963	2.5112021	-0.0318	-0.0258159918238	0.978226710	17585	16109	17956.538	15366.762	2.6900134	2.4299247	-0.1467	-0.230498649676	0.903313211	25341	23489	25656.069	22473.476	3.8930962	3.4962892	-0.1551	-0.07563811888	0.898074212	6399	6540	6665.0781	6264.2239	1.096073	1.131078	0.0454	-0.031670280013	1.031936713	10788	8437	11099.362	8054.7374	1.7795706	1.500812	-0.2458	-0.262513958037	0.843356314	6948	8974	7218.3128	8557.1912	1.9607224	2.0154048	0.0397	-0.0136319839709	1.027888915	8672	7200	8950.7623	6888.695	1.3753095	1.1487438	-0.2597	-0.0982095911308	0.83526216	6745	6010	7017.6456	5751.3251	1.1164977	0.9983008	-0.1614	-0.234003648107	0.89413617	3634	3785	3834.1069	3628.63	0.7685881	0.6107912	-0.3315	-0.0799816651679	0.794692618	6186	7262	6440.5766	6946.883	1.4273999	1.2643421	-0.1750	-0.213802395577	0.885765919	6653	7632	6925.801	7301.2621	1.2942702	1.1677724	-0.1484	-0.16280161506	0.902263220	5175	4615	5392.1632	4428.0972	0.7546823	0.6406654	-0.2363	0.00291000874535	0.8489206!sample_table_end
