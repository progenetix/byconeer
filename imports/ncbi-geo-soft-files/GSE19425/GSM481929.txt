Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481929/suppl/GSM481929_MR353.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6090	4604	5645.8534	4890.5589	2.5500499	2.3202855	0.1362	0.11641013965	1.09902422	2219	1783	2085.392	1906.7817	0.8909145	0.8713188	0.0321	0.00550605696312	1.02248973	4273	3511	3971.0586	3745.1792	1.8144388	1.7391401	0.0611	-0.129740148675	1.04329654	4528	2860	4207.0491	3056.1374	1.8074441	1.3372727	0.4347	0.0537167936752	1.35158985	8703	6571	8042.8397	6966.4279	4.0967988	3.5118418	0.2223	-0.0553235625892	1.1665676	4010	3682	3730.0054	3923.9673	1.774009	1.9035637	-0.1017	-0.0927860614971	0.9319417	4386	5438	4075.1316	5773.3286	1.3067862	1.4946892	-0.1938	-0.120772927205	0.87428638	2016	1997	1895.2522	2138.2535	0.7792003	0.9071284	-0.2193	-0.0678038507369	0.85897469	5776	4806	5357.1703	5104.769	2.1950866	2.2354819	-0.0263	0.038427331601	0.981929910	7131	5767	6594.3292	6121.3838	2.4103127	2.3017516	0.0665	-0.0559775852187	1.047164611	24015	16626	21421.774	17936.633	8.2134171	7.1152322	0.2071	0.0391218256352	1.154342812	6274	4305	5814.327	4570.8609	1.8280332	1.3873583	0.3980	-0.00340826364717	1.317635913	7365	7396	6809.7965	7844.0399	1.7830536	1.8072949	-0.0195	-0.0256450108499	0.98658714	7424	5142	6864.3519	5460.9454	3.6112599	3.0173804	0.2592	0.0131028901888	1.196819615	5572	4725	5170.4917	5018.754	1.7743126	1.6906399	0.0697	0.0390159526942	1.049491716	5080	5291	4721.3962	5618.4012	1.4439159	1.5396725	-0.0926	-0.0286809749178	0.937807117	1529	1370	1446.0587	1462.6238	0.6200687	0.666491	-0.1042	-0.0133232911005	0.930348218	4303	3498	3998.553	3731.425	2.2509532	2.1135702	0.0909	0.0471518035849	1.065000419	3908	3424	3636.5182	3653.1159	1.6067849	1.7000944	-0.0814	-0.050243187277	0.945115120	2412	1903	2260.1253	2036.4352	0.7639345	0.7414347	0.0431	-0.0570279734367	1.0303463!sample_table_end
