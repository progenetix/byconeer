Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481946/suppl/GSM481946_MR372.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4144	2980	4434.5884	2859.7784	1.558293	0.9821825	-0.6659	0.0395929642847	0.63029382	4020	4781	4296.503	4361.6209	1.5559947	1.5967244	0.0373	0.0547565304684	1.0261763	2771	3202	2890.8642	3047.1534	1.0310587	1.0717485	0.0558	0.0973094171666	1.0394644	8624	10799	9303.3445	9427.3475	3.4371095	3.4095815	-0.0116	-0.0269828220596	0.99199095	9092	11926	9800.2356	10420.652	3.8809178	3.9980809	0.0429	-0.03608452325	1.03018956	5188	7290	5604.204	6456.9048	2.1045498	2.3892165	0.1830	0.0835923174421	1.13526247	1712	2424	1723.7947	2386.1666	0.6022453	0.8319241	0.4661	0.209991538657	1.3813718	2105	2201	2145.8118	2190.2104	0.7628359	0.7649854	0.0041	-0.0707702554384	1.00281769	3456	2821	3652.987	2726.8152	1.1997752	0.9173926	-0.3872	-0.163664480918	0.764637110	7115	8212	7699.0671	7217.4524	2.9561868	2.6834808	-0.1396	-0.101695060792	0.907750711	15380	16016	16143.594	14140.751	6.1718178	5.3426763	-0.2081	-0.0621305322837	0.865656812	8179	12201	8831.4445	10666.998	2.9424146	3.5656805	0.2772	-0.0589060872673	1.211821213	4236	4452	4537.1418	4092.3689	1.5342492	1.3519964	-0.1824	-0.187608700301	0.881210414	9012	11059	9715.312	9655.4675	3.7183258	3.7296726	0.0044	-0.157827613779	1.003051515	4251	4308	4553.8746	3978.1126	1.4536371	1.236025	-0.2340	-0.154357439913	0.850298216	2926	3572	3068.5348	3360.2672	0.9866803	1.0881634	0.1412	-0.148675766529	1.10285317	1049	888	1040.7691	938.5956	0.3916855	0.3503224	-0.1610	0.155305736527	0.894397118	4567	5714	4908.0147	5129.6871	1.6872118	1.739747	0.0442	-0.0332001201167	1.031137319	2788	2319	2910.3786	2294.6697	1.0490065	0.8294854	-0.3387	-0.195008234204	0.790734220	1747	1592	1761.9609	1627.5276	0.6840153	0.6310204	-0.1163	-0.0840839562675	0.9225238!sample_table_end
