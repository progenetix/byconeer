Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481748/suppl/GSM481748_JBH516.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2382	2368	2324.018	2409.7176	0.8178175	0.8661644	0.0829	0.14984426041	1.0591172	3324	3521	3242.982	3535.1576	1.1859206	1.2592521	0.0866	0.14851597141	1.0618353	2218	2154	2166.5639	2199.4087	0.8294323	0.8975235	0.1138	0.186136668631	1.08209384	10770	8688	10560.162	8508.2609	4.3726889	3.7770063	-0.2113	0.0433169247083	0.8637725	13955	13578	13693.927	13083.87	5.6786549	5.8892386	0.0525	-0.00494060603308	1.03708336	8387	6779	8209.93	6673.5883	3.3624917	2.9015426	-0.2127	-0.158661742168	0.86291447	2077	1975	2027.8982	2020.022	1.0932076	1.1245659	0.0408	-0.0168647146782	1.02868468	2053	1788	2004.3336	1832.4142	0.8653367	0.8264653	-0.0663	-0.00323884765964	0.95507949	4141	4061	4051.2812	4064.7101	1.3857185	1.3495587	-0.0381	0.00424810286474	0.973905310	7336	7635	7174.5062	7497.2943	3.5971181	3.6459504	0.0195	-0.0630480742787	1.013575311	7720	6228	7550.7081	6151.3582	3.5263153	3.0072718	-0.2297	-0.209626868255	0.852808512	4643	4015	4540.9035	4019.2517	2.5264701	2.2928482	-0.1400	0.040017362722	0.907530313	1400	1666	1366.5461	1711.1265	0.9509828	1.0480241	0.1402	-0.0353134564085	1.102043114	8638	8719	8457.4808	8537.5544	3.6172834	3.16514	-0.1926	-0.0138560963576	0.875004715	1484	1544	1448.2573	1591.0978	0.7586906	0.8463661	0.1578	-0.0098828064201	1.115561616	1512	1760	1475.9845	1804.5644	0.770467	0.9832934	0.3519	-0.0580304943569	1.276230417	1036	1202	1017.7336	1255.5814	0.3723196	0.4481021	0.2673	0.119398676981	1.203541518	3363	3040	3281.1529	3073.3495	1.2650165	1.1570939	-0.1287	-0.152658354018	0.914686719	1690	1927	1650.363	1971.6406	0.6197697	0.7082076	0.1924	0.00683169541463	1.142694720	1736	1497	1694.8014	1545.4236	0.7568624	0.6460078	-0.2285	0.032612785606	0.853534!sample_table_end
