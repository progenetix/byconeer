Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481967/suppl/GSM481967_MR451.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6146	5936	5480.2123	6498.9572	1.1412833	1.4396967	-0.3351	-0.307811384117	0.79272482	6918	7295	6176.9948	7884.502	1.3974112	1.9045452	-0.4467	-0.28635607033	0.73372433	4724	3741	4208.4817	4169.2807	0.8552669	0.8954087	-0.0662	-0.335904764188	0.95516934	12314	13947	11102.442	14668.802	2.4587215	3.3993096	-0.4673	-0.450265247893	0.72330035	17811	19980	16101.802	20730.327	3.416043	4.6974653	-0.4596	-0.479933325636	0.72720986	13706	11617	12365.818	12331.901	2.5176011	2.7299485	-0.1168	-0.117656311084	0.92221567	3253	3317	2897.8477	3706.4283	0.8207327	0.9141896	-0.1556	-0.131305207438	0.89777088	3002	3128	2673.1598	3504.36	0.7019335	0.9677304	-0.4633	-0.362535648848	0.725349	8289	7728	7441.4121	8330.3071	1.6024002	1.9088058	-0.2524	-0.188893643369	0.839477910	9251	8211	8299.0491	8827.3102	3.3222509	3.5315078	-0.0881	-0.235446161388	0.940745711	9198	10511	8251.0125	11212.337	2.7243341	3.8661025	-0.5050	-0.497990727802	0.70467212	5399	8264	4803.9778	8883.0552	1.5061189	2.5995032	-0.7874	-0.745481443455	0.579387213	2849	3520	2536.597	3927.9023	1.2788868	1.6420732	-0.3606	-0.424125418297	0.778824514	11553	14529	10402.422	15250.1	2.3695023	3.7105467	-0.6470	-0.640319703351	0.638585815	2995	2553	2666.953	2882.6918	0.7537325	0.8334104	-0.1450	-0.230983770739	0.904395416	2792	3167	2485.8984	3545.8306	0.7649458	1.0007375	-0.3876	-0.350914869635	0.76438217	2418	1943	2157.9217	2219.3844	0.4984763	0.546536	-0.1328	-0.165226111034	0.912064918	6260	6665	5581.7964	7247.1381	1.1613513	1.5282396	-0.3961	-0.471131891531	0.759927519	2791	2536	2485.0108	2864.4896	0.6227679	0.7496883	-0.2676	-0.339635468443	0.830702520	2190	2159	1956.189	2459.0829	0.8541793	0.9578227	-0.1652	-0.201290082657	0.8917927!sample_table_end
