Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481499/suppl/GSM481499_DE408.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2595	1739	1908.0523	2216.3016	1.1199006	1.2694473	-0.1808	0.0836342503662	0.88219542	2082	909	1518.3723	1283.9447	1.2561019	0.8730109	0.5249	-0.0139949769917	1.43881593	4558	1401	3398.8104	1843.8347	1.8370981	1.2600155	0.5440	0.43291142351	1.45799644	3872	1527	2876.255	1988.1896	1.8657484	1.6840648	0.1478	0.0487344851475	1.1078845	9756	5846	7129.7891	6968.2884	3.8889571	4.026716	-0.0502	-0.134171763417	0.96578886	5531	3671	4127.2043	4414.7138	2.479348	2.936316	-0.2440	-0.077746637462	0.84437377	3816	1163	2835.1107	1579.8055	1.9746072	1.0438644	0.9196	0.451666160057	1.89163198	1163	476	742.2106	767.0799	0.5642493	0.6743142	-0.2571	-0.270294782855	0.83677519	1738	1455	1233.4571	1905.5183	1.062658	1.3485289	-0.3437	-0.0318782741317	0.788012810	3042	2105	2246.3597	2632.7379	2.3352441	3.0453169	-0.3830	0.186607804977	0.766831211	8935	5041	6551.9158	6014.2455	5.4423222	5.9281304	-0.1234	0.228137977978	0.918050412	3090	1431	2282.4268	1877.8617	1.5739725	1.3892148	0.1801	0.121574726545	1.132994313	1808	1581	1293.7835	2049.1908	1.5615139	2.2175267	-0.5060	0.0723998675806	0.704169214	5414	3851	4041.9844	4627.0172	2.6749976	2.6843156	-0.0050	0.0248199253386	0.996528715	3205	1709	2369.7105	2184.2927	1.5939828	1.5295458	0.0595	0.20465258233	1.042128216	2079	1337	1516.0586	1771.4272	1.1131129	1.2050993	-0.1146	-0.212210750802	0.92366917	1029	948	625.7665	1330.4901	0.5483461	0.8331944	-0.6036	-0.269545920823	0.658125118	3874	2037	2877.7256	2552.247	1.4123017	1.5427654	-0.1275	0.0189857615072	0.915435219	1520	1343	1040.6684	1778.0763	0.9746783	1.3328436	-0.4515	-0.134127463256	0.731277420	1197	420	771.5664	700.1251	0.7915384	0.7454226	0.0866	-0.0439199523206	1.0618653!sample_table_end
