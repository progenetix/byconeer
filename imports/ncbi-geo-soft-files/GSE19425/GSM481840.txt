Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481840/suppl/GSM481840_MR166.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4381	4233	4329.8623	4263.9944	1.2757333	1.2054959	-0.0817	-0.045662159795	0.94494342	3252	3486	3226.9395	3516.2476	0.9854877	1.0381718	0.0751	0.00154271429632	1.05345993	4086	3548	4039.4449	3578.8762	1.2345112	1.05884	-0.2215	-0.171125617572	0.85769984	9612	8147	9366.8914	8221.6906	3.0910678	2.6148147	-0.2414	-0.109862651186	0.8459265	15921	14985	15399.742	15174.878	5.3710294	4.9232257	-0.1256	-0.0254625085964	0.91662616	8649	9957	8453.0297	10049.744	2.7581829	3.1107183	0.1735	0.0991034158389	1.12781437	3148	2844	3124.1274	2866.1606	0.8846993	0.8082302	-0.1304	-0.0308318677246	0.91356488	3123	3531	3099.4576	3561.7053	0.8926882	1.033268	0.2110	0.173089174364	1.15747929	6538	6420	6420.8535	6481.0947	1.7466935	1.7263958	-0.0169	-0.0871175599885	0.988379410	17579	16587	16980.168	16795.921	3.7868543	3.8808749	0.0354	0.00233138592217	1.024828111	16773	15199	16206.5	15387.953	3.8579218	3.8495045	-0.0032	0.00557072949003	0.997818112	9410	8118	9176.0794	8192.3166	2.245132	2.0239415	-0.1496	-0.211076946951	0.901479913	10206	9422	9928.6646	9502.2567	1.895205	1.8968407	0.0012	-0.0889637901617	1.00086314	10223	10072	9944.7555	10167.625	3.2703596	3.20444	-0.0294	-0.0869135991008	0.979843315	4570	4373	4512.8463	4402.9746	1.0366138	1.0323408	-0.0060	-0.1140434404	0.99587816	4641	4557	4581.5533	4584.6915	1.1447634	1.1530844	0.0104	-0.142973242283	1.007268717	2020	1518	2016.0709	1543.3131	0.6210303	0.4611926	-0.4293	-0.386004458489	0.742624918	5264	5423	5194.1502	5462.3048	1.7282845	1.7028969	-0.0213	-0.2269910861	0.985310419	3713	3435	3677.3392	3464.5505	1.0549942	0.9686937	-0.1231	-0.129778394971	0.918198120	4124	3720	4076.6281	3751.1451	0.9716213	0.9340193	-0.0569	-0.116728584986	0.9612997!sample_table_end
