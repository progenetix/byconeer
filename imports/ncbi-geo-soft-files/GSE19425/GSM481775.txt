Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481775/suppl/GSM481775_JBH549.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1150	1282	1255.888	1173.6781	0.9440265	0.8947672	0.0773	0.0029421156597	1.05505252	1299	1423	1412.3715	1304.305	1.1852727	1.0408937	0.1874	0.0472919858409	1.13870673	1048	1063	1149.7709	971.81426	0.6728105	0.6056014	0.1518	0.164578932137	1.11097894	7807	6285	7865.9588	5910.5716	4.7278497	3.8500241	0.2963	0.0135497300331	1.22800525	13183	13878	12950.234	13328.522	7.2084466	8.1430398	-0.1759	0.0186700630461	0.88522796	4829	4972	4967.3466	4645.5964	3.145549	3.2212325	-0.0343	-0.0651663328558	0.97650487	1611	1832	1730.8682	1680.3595	1.0442019	1.0543045	-0.0139	-0.0060734848006	0.99041788	1499	1590	1614.3786	1458.1795	0.8731187	0.8581046	0.0250	-0.0911268499543	1.01749679	1975	2305	2110.7316	2127.0773	1.6284532	1.5539305	0.0676	0.00218028366461	1.047957510	4160	5404	4303.2527	5061.2626	2.7456702	3.1430498	-0.1950	-0.0375165263371	0.873568711	12394	10474	12210.16	9989.9641	7.1474294	6.1184042	0.2243	0.143667563481	1.168185212	3992	3755	4137.0639	3490.1452	2.6358348	2.1886843	0.2682	0.063934719801	1.20430113	1576	2485	1694.1283	2293.7748	1.0968261	1.2924334	-0.2368	0.00874201646808	0.848651914	4718	4867	4858.8119	4544.9586	5.043201	4.166081	0.2756	0.0986188477519	1.210538415	1654	2031	1776.2738	1867.5175	0.9507674	1.0175352	-0.0979	-0.043350848818	0.934382916	1157	1767	1263.4508	1619.4541	0.6926299	0.9090034	-0.3922	0.0343557513998	0.761966217	431	623	495.99784	569.16077	0.4109331	0.4602228	-0.1634	-0.0177285949447	0.892900518	2153	2412	2292.056	2226.3461	1.4696441	1.4656361	0.0039	-0.0131541627568	1.002734619	603	992	683.21246	907.47722	0.5795133	0.7420805	-0.3567	-0.0277179458071	0.780930520	1145	1222	1250.4848	1117.4686	0.8251825	0.6772325	0.2851	-0.0430683878862	1.2184627!sample_table_end
