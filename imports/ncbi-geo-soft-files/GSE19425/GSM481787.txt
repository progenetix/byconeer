Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481787/suppl/GSM481787_MR025.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1715	1733	1675.2601	1771.6494	0.7904287	0.8024715	-0.0218	-0.13697809469	0.98499292	1570	1574	1534.7035	1610.4582	0.7957834	0.7779881	0.0326	-0.0190635114934	1.02287353	2078	2168	2020.4439	2219.8247	0.8965808	0.999417	-0.1567	-0.00676253035548	0.89710384	12771	10912	12093.807	11175.304	5.6548312	5.3079834	0.0913	0.0817789143864	1.06534455	21504	18186	20255.672	18533.185	9.5356904	9.0913545	0.0688	0.0916945541171	1.04887456	9122	5669	8653.1409	5850.4925	4.089749	2.8446758	0.5237	0.432088290861	1.43768547	3023	1971	2916.832	2018.1638	1.2111601	0.9120188	0.4093	0.3280824131	1.3279998	2692	2764	2603.6866	2844.1964	1.2884483	1.4277439	-0.1481	-0.0157847963549	0.90243659	2091	2036	2032.7553	2084.0629	0.9869886	0.931102	0.0841	0.040058617023	1.06002210	7564	6202	7190.5622	6398.6517	4.1828711	3.7677819	0.1508	0.134028085539	1.11016811	5208	4039	4967.2519	4169.901	2.8854407	2.4161286	0.2561	0.135263903955	1.194241312	5842	6167	5562.7081	6362.8407	2.6217558	3.0620793	-0.2240	0.00577090851447	0.856201113	1690	1609	1651.1714	1645.7155	0.7900842	0.7917846	-0.0031	-0.026200178121	0.997852514	8282	9060	7866.5665	9299.7696	4.0124692	4.5058741	-0.1673	-0.0542144353195	0.890497415	1880	1656	1832.7506	1693.0131	0.7629401	0.7315825	0.0605	0.0931527296764	1.042862616	1725	1851	1684.8944	1894.9784	0.7341963	0.8581549	-0.2251	-0.170648826199	0.855552117	514	405	492.3426	446.5861	0.2514467	0.2164331	0.2163	0.076248222083	1.161775318	3940	3847	3789.0877	3972.892	1.8152635	1.9347486	-0.0920	0.00413517987036	0.938242519	869	1017	857.0467	1043.8546	0.4500689	0.5108739	-0.1828	-0.109264851629	0.880978420	914	1026	900.7441	1052.8065	0.467562	0.5286177	-0.1771	-0.0702598950986	0.8844993!sample_table_end
