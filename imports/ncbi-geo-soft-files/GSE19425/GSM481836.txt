Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481836/suppl/GSM481836_MR160.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5346	4669	5073.5085	4880.3787	1.3629447	1.2754855	-0.0957	-0.158029392209	0.93583072	4868	3701	4619.8962	3872.0762	1.0764005	0.8929654	-0.2695	-0.195697254751	0.82958473	4423	3946	4207.655	4129.7989	1.2497035	1.2224228	-0.0318	0.0458962580723	0.97817024	13336	8382	12520.152	8746.5956	4.0068878	2.7439531	-0.5462	-0.383250805117	0.6848095	20513	13734	19236.428	14176.723	5.6789873	4.0470089	-0.4888	-0.295399570992	0.71262866	9765	7440	9187.5504	7769.0924	2.9462318	2.4072964	-0.2915	-0.178315692491	0.81707647	2522	2110	2427.1377	2205.1245	0.7021328	0.621895	-0.1751	-0.279026914094	0.88572278	2937	2183	2814.5759	2281.6314	0.8903226	0.7192852	-0.3078	-0.40451723056	0.80789279	6117	4981	5804.3713	5216.2751	1.3037731	1.1501747	-0.1808	-0.0821894622903	0.882189210	11068	7870	10395.411	8215.6946	3.2504121	2.6118778	-0.3155	-0.37274210282	0.803552811	15052	11941	14139.241	12366.749	4.4042196	3.9234587	-0.1668	-0.213806093248	0.890840812	10838	9264	10179.045	9656.4252	2.9664766	2.8685075	-0.0485	-0.200114126243	0.966974513	6121	5167	5808.0591	5414.5324	1.6635999	1.6232867	-0.0354	-0.225571302393	0.975767514	28531	23624	26800.493	23922.776	3.272993	2.8573494	-0.1959	-0.208346686313	0.873008115	4171	3614	3974.5329	3778.9292	1.1058133	1.0723712	-0.0443	-0.058878390556	0.969757816	3210	3047	3073.971	3184.2357	0.8894829	0.9318372	0.0671	-0.229042100103	1.047616717	2214	2000	2137.1648	2089.6214	0.5140994	0.5036244	-0.0297	0.111954742369	0.979624518	8005	6291	7544.5826	6587.4465	1.742741	1.5164085	-0.2007	-0.218024778375	0.870128419	3363	3063	3217.3306	3200.4351	0.8980259	0.8608945	-0.0609	-0.0472562148371	0.958652220	2514	2115	2419.6842	2210.365	0.8356682	0.7114559	-0.2322	-0.243705080004	0.8513617!sample_table_end
