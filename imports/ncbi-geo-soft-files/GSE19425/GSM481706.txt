Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481706/suppl/GSM481706_JBH202.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5916	6097	6398.786	5494.1529	1.4426025	1.1715672	-0.3002	-0.139727573257	0.81212062	3769	4661	4237.6603	4126.4841	1.1955066	1.1458272	-0.0612	-0.00156556733251	0.95844493	4853	4799	5338.5294	4252.4734	1.0076944	0.7933964	-0.3449	-0.14382360931	0.78733824	11086	11176	11438.268	10569.462	2.0652559	1.8694301	-0.1437	-0.194391102587	0.90518085	22318	20302	22381.697	19680.253	4.2975194	3.7627975	-0.1917	-0.267931476075	0.87557436	8949	10559	9361.5421	9941.6831	1.8521983	1.9207871	0.0525	0.122242662043	1.03703097	1875	2239	2231.8637	1964.7557	0.6017992	0.52003	-0.2107	-0.06083471272	0.86412558	3922	5167	4390.6133	4594.6756	0.7525583	0.7895115	0.0692	0.00798338530769	1.04910359	5218	7293	5710.6783	6668.0345	1.57668	1.8615026	0.2396	0.193907208466	1.18064710	16623	17422	16808.5	16831.807	2.9198151	2.9182348	-0.0008	0.00954639805638	0.999458711	28893	22098	28878.07	21445.854	5.32676	3.8781263	-0.4579	-0.15030498317	0.72804612	5390	6076	5883.5153	5473.4901	1.1807981	1.0639347	-0.1504	-0.411530898581	0.901030113	9167	8838	9571.844	8220.397	1.7693393	1.5907393	-0.1535	-0.0679640533564	0.899058314	8852	9311	9267.7989	8690.4554	2.6517224	2.5794325	-0.0399	-0.11036686256	0.972738515	6026	7770	6507.2739	7150.8578	1.3289532	1.3811613	0.0556	0.202645274861	1.039285116	5776	6554	6261.3689	5941.1963	1.1481716	1.1389751	-0.0116	0.00829856187253	0.991990317	1894	1807	2253.2417	1610.919	0.599741	0.4182369	-0.5200	-0.283890728838	0.697362618	6323	7338	6804.5122	6713.504	1.3968555	1.3931891	-0.0038	-0.0119384230287	0.997375219	4093	5211	4567.1441	4636.3373	1.05913	1.080699	0.0291	0.109217319256	1.020364820	3328	4257	3787.0647	3751.6997	0.6806473	0.6605922	-0.0431	-0.0414220998282	0.9705351!sample_table_end
