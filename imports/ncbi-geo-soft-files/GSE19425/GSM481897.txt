Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481897/suppl/GSM481897_MR311.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	7522	9280	7351.7647	9153.2328	2.1097185	2.6750862	-0.3425	0.0247884434549	0.78865442	3301	3255	3352.9686	3193.7548	1.0027293	0.9668244	0.0526	0.138181037846	1.0371373	4763	3868	4757.3104	3803.011	1.4021792	1.1174706	0.3274	0.269343202775	1.25477954	11732	10619	11245.566	10441.473	3.297177	3.0532425	0.1109	0.125558665718	1.07989365	20500	19411	19418.407	18879.552	6.1467592	5.8860221	0.0625	0.00452771106702	1.04429776	9160	7110	8875.4171	6997.2363	2.7482514	2.1827797	0.3323	0.022217658393	1.25906047	2028	1770	2104.846	1734.7129	0.9132109	0.7217453	0.3395	0.0389624516085	1.26528138	3196	3948	3249.1393	3882.7406	0.8797153	1.0913542	-0.3110	-0.137747633975	0.80607689	4859	6665	4847.8933	6556.0473	1.3733386	1.8840039	-0.4561	-0.174124712537	0.728946810	7968	8416	7766.1886	8302.2472	2.2039019	2.5124668	-0.1890	-0.0344960048882	0.877186511	20783	21659	19685.96	21021.488	5.6950962	6.4094056	-0.1705	-0.0733815702945	0.888552912	11560	9202	11086.223	9077.1874	4.0375631	3.2085144	0.3316	0.062602668266	1.258390213	4972	6878	4954.3883	6767.7978	1.8660629	2.4323422	-0.3823	-0.0721082478343	0.767187714	13370	15095	12755.005	14752.415	5.0479356	5.3507806	-0.0841	0.000713236364559	0.943401715	3656	4738	3696.5478	4652.2822	1.209334	1.5253551	-0.3349	-0.066928509599	0.792821316	2480	3124	2551.7907	3067.2328	0.9371444	1.0915125	-0.2200	-0.118011251152	0.858574217	2377	2364	2451.8762	2316.182	0.740897	0.7228285	0.0356	0.0409694190741	1.02499718	4195	5221	4216.3998	5134.9684	1.6057101	1.7728242	-0.1428	-0.0999767161557	0.905735619	3198	3850	3251.1168	3784.5482	1.0649139	1.2821297	-0.2678	0.00098098757075	0.83058220	3201	3156	3254.0822	3098.1454	0.7395326	0.7742659	-0.0662	0.0858758867958	0.9551404!sample_table_end
