Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481488/suppl/GSM481488_DE395.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2408	1181	1764.9696	1609.6797	1.0279883	0.9546902	-0.1067	-0.133527724193	0.92869752	2236	1348	1635.1197	1811.0279	1.2019405	1.219372	0.0208	-0.0101715419016	1.01450283	2861	1200	2116.7065	1632.7792	1.405913	1.1398606	-0.3027	-0.0827068416513	0.81076174	6018	2767	4429.4995	3522.7189	2.8570676	2.3281474	-0.2954	-0.122241240734	0.8148735	14236	6101	10036.153	7699.1626	5.8612264	5.0086502	-0.2268	-0.165579746922	0.85453966	5906	3141	4350.3547	3968.2458	3.0827653	2.9360994	-0.0703	-0.094542608345	0.95242397	2050	1060	1490.6929	1461.3662	1.1432704	1.0993174	-0.0566	0.0137809574765	0.9615558	1464	720	1029.7819	1041.6042	0.6022289	0.6156426	0.0318	-0.0533416544165	1.02227349	2041	904	1483.2643	1265.589	1.0917901	0.8279742	-0.3990	-0.171462602728	0.758363810	5944	3220	4377.2138	4063.0823	2.7034856	2.3683962	-0.1909	-0.267481354148	0.876052811	13447	6688	9524.8207	8460.7076	5.5477554	4.9692051	-0.1589	-0.252459190831	0.895714512	3103	1483	2303.7211	1973.058	1.9585446	1.4848427	-0.3995	-0.196429568608	0.758135713	2752	1342	2032.4064	1803.8641	1.6730539	1.3571452	-0.3019	-0.386742353147	0.811178314	3584	2246	2671.7478	2892.7974	2.1928295	2.1420011	-0.0338	-0.0640502189195	0.976820615	2652	1410	1955.3226	1884.842	1.4400938	1.20873	-0.2527	-0.172886158223	0.839341116	1827	859	1312.2258	1210.0475	1.087708	0.888412	-0.2920	-0.224331775846	0.816774417	1209	613	837.2934	909.6902	0.6218999	0.577632	-0.1065	0.0155767812836	0.928818218	2739	1154	2022.3939	1576.7244	1.499552	1.3068817	-0.1984	-0.254884922359	0.871514719	1987	943	1438.7825	1314.8935	0.9537305	0.820797	-0.2166	-0.177239216267	0.860617220	1485	499	1046.249	766.7804	0.6573741	0.5166335	-0.3476	-0.0950225394826	0.7859048!sample_table_end
