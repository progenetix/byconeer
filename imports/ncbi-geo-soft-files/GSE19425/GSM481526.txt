Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481526/suppl/GSM481526_DE489.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3033	1978	2317.1917	2560.2858	0.9635934	1.0783655	0.1623	0.0486898516732	1.11910842	3282	2505	2511.6802	3206.6126	1.406665	1.7490376	0.3143	0.294036289408	1.24339313	2069	2088	1602.9225	2702.6358	0.7203552	1.1487038	0.6732	0.529677944006	1.59463524	15627	12353	13488.22	12357.589	5.4899195	4.8352115	-0.1832	-0.217056831093	0.88074365	11921	12365	10082.364	12367.74	4.9664933	5.7880447	0.2208	0.228147215554	1.16541886	9674	5538	8047.4278	6391.8392	4.1013791	3.0434071	-0.4304	-0.558226863132	0.74204487	4322	2162	3329.5545	2799.965	1.7847241	1.4197186	-0.3301	-0.149253965978	0.79548358	6212	2438	4922.9077	3129.9337	1.911017	1.1473257	-0.7361	-0.791108224974	0.60037449	2062	1201	1597.6154	1565.3445	0.8071233	0.7836039	-0.0427	-0.0709844793821	0.970860210	6556	5571	5222.253	6422.997	2.0635482	2.5974688	0.3320	0.107052274044	1.25873911	9720	8027	8088.4609	8641.9745	3.1509597	3.3508505	0.0887	0.0716219619232	1.06343812	7729	12672	6254.965	12626.956	2.657301	5.4582185	1.0385	0.599423777896	2.054045913	3933	2302	3029.0941	2973.2737	1.1047716	1.1387424	0.0437	-0.0896455272411	1.030749114	4994	6663	3873.8122	7430.7321	2.5113821	4.6762657	0.8969	0.886551786085	1.862028715	2572	1588	1976.7155	2066.3799	0.7577594	0.7852371	0.0514	0.00767029244241	1.036261816	1616	1279	1277.5537	1667.7878	0.5359198	0.7191636	0.4243	0.132971596879	1.34192417	476	274	390.1329	360.8733	0.2066598	0.1882103	-0.1349	-0.0252620294332	0.910725218	4521	1761	3486.2431	2288.2722	1.8675783	1.2579864	-0.5701	-0.536685364876	0.673592319	1399	710	1123.5741	923.6938	0.5406794	0.449036	-0.2679	-0.139052739247	0.830503220	2673	1325	2051.0374	1728.2317	0.7562235	0.6633573	-0.1890	-0.392141584298	0.8771974!sample_table_end
