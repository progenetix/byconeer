Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481735/suppl/GSM481735_JBH407.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3434	4077	3561.0872	3925.2286	1.2309907	1.2360958	-0.0060	-0.0230960945734	0.99586992	3237	3889	3360.8697	3743.8365	1.742005	1.887351	-0.1156	-0.12815758133	0.92298943	4974	4689	5141.3336	4522.6092	1.4240188	1.2708789	0.1641	0.169597183888	1.12049924	12119	11551	12162.928	11112.039	3.4658713	3.2687143	0.0845	0.107181665692	1.06031645	17277	16919	17025.961	16478.302	4.9023728	4.6307014	0.0822	0.0791727311444	1.05866746	10106	10115	10240.659	9716.7482	3.1333192	3.0022889	0.0616	0.144855618559	1.04364357	5419	5634	5578.614	5424.8749	1.218771	1.1844467	0.0412	0.0900837878397	1.02897928	3037	3049	3159.2448	2933.6554	0.8090798	0.7931804	0.0286	0.0956405101775	1.02004529	933	1021	1003.4837	974.9398	0.8182517	0.8266526	-0.0147	-0.0152639196116	0.989837510	20791	17491	20238.989	17052.106	4.4860753	4.5028792	-0.0054	-0.000753312304401	0.996268211	30804	24263	29131.083	24092.707	6.6852097	6.3131203	0.0826	0.140195440491	1.058939112	15948	13692	15766.485	13257.581	2.9827311	2.7922289	0.0952	0.0830206555807	1.068225813	10786	9557	10889.758	9175.5894	2.3175762	2.053217	0.1747	0.0421778372871	1.128753714	4474	7142	4632.607	6855.1212	2.3257073	2.6926703	-0.2114	-0.047728273264	0.863717815	6044	5628	6187.6841	5419.1611	1.1624185	1.1341296	0.0355	0.0901514190225	1.024943316	7187	7351	7342.2917	7056.8324	1.4115287	1.4229739	-0.0117	0.0541692956292	0.991956917	1299	1645	1393.4031	1567.6616	0.49745	0.5075898	-0.0291	0.0548375048328	0.980023718	6247	6828	6387.799	6550.2977	2.0670705	1.9411743	0.0907	0.16071667382	1.064855719	3584	4810	3716.2077	4638.5928	1.6247727	1.8761489	-0.2075	-0.0581778691403	0.866014820	2167	2063	2277.4531	1975.8335	0.6604266	0.6166331	0.0990	0.00295622519875	1.0710204!sample_table_end
