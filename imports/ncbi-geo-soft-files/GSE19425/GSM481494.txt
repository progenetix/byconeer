Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481494/suppl/GSM481494_DE401.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3817	2138	2923.5255	2640.8023	1.6899541	1.5159717	-0.1567	-0.172974895516	0.89704912	1930	1435	1534.3435	1809.4344	1.1410445	1.0822229	-0.0764	0.205485853465	0.94844943	4616	1825	3464.5207	2270.4279	1.6270576	1.3607424	-0.2579	-0.241485078239	0.8363214	6444	3712	4720.2752	4527.5288	2.2450529	2.6243917	0.2252	0.323870039832	1.16896655	11228	5576	7752.8093	6936.0661	4.0399014	4.7492726	0.2334	0.256342115252	1.17559126	7966	3989	5711.3209	4863.3829	2.8344414	3.0417483	0.1018	0.109423414737	1.07313857	1800	1289	1432.4436	1638.3851	0.9503218	0.9727579	0.0337	0.340147146087	1.02360898	1781	951	1417.2147	1232.1632	0.6646618	0.654542	-0.0221	0.199405246837	0.98477449	4284	2360	3239.5786	2900.6886	2.4502784	1.6412586	-0.5781	-0.291998235618	0.669825410	8108	4992	5803.4967	6140.3099	3.4137312	3.2205588	-0.0840	-0.425804398799	0.943413111	25619	11456	15985.718	15732.12	8.6678212	8.5411515	-0.0212	-0.221108244256	0.985386212	4027	3546	3068.7835	4323.4295	1.6786928	2.2368205	0.4141	0.253716549922	1.332477613	5204	3614	3874.2149	4408.0625	3.0698006	2.4379942	-0.3325	-0.550237261662	0.794186514	6160	3624	4531.9049	4420.5066	3.5396432	2.8153404	-0.3303	-0.170614969398	0.795374115	4762	2675	3564.9336	3267.6004	1.7603376	1.5595928	-0.1747	-0.255546312482	0.885962416	3947	2078	3014.2563	2567.8808	1.6112019	1.3040289	-0.3052	-0.327247005447	0.809351617	2026	1206	1606.8591	1539.6188	1.0589102	0.8733604	-0.2779	-0.273529806997	0.824772818	4657	1863	3492.7324	2313.941	1.8605106	1.6537865	-0.1699	-0.186615934147	0.888888519	2427	1924	1903.8117	2383.6453	1.3498053	1.3380112	-0.0127	-0.282538199027	0.991262420	1919	980	1525.9098	1266.3254	0.8419383	0.603194	-0.4811	-0.168247257415	0.716435!sample_table_end
