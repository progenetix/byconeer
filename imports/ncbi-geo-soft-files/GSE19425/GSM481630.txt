Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9775!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481630/suppl/GSM481630_JA685.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1949	2032	2223.2484	1779.5259	0.8158775	0.739351	-0.1421	-0.214449381305	0.90620342	1510	2320	1768.4876	2021.1792	0.7319611	0.6305878	-0.2151	-0.290559296502	0.86150453	4312	5562	4486.464	4957.9048	1.7698025	1.6189262	-0.1286	-0.251975368528	0.91474964	9005	5547	8609.9904	4944.8532	3.8390375	2.2487945	-0.7716	-0.564130333349	0.58577035	12657	11484	11656.195	10432.246	4.863266	3.3370102	-0.5434	-0.660147261341	0.68616656	2960	5479	3245.2095	4885.6968	2.380257	2.5583938	0.1041	0.129679596397	1.07483927	1177	3254	1403.3256	2836.8727	1.0369009	1.5141573	0.5462	0.706290241748	1.4602728	1206	2447	1434.423	2133.0069	1.0241223	1.2226937	0.2557	0.212175228515	1.19389429	1357	3490	1597.7602	3067.2036	0.8800018	1.2455695	0.5012	0.644525168149	1.415416910	5904	5756	5924.8612	5130.9348	3.3712988	3.4301706	0.0250	-0.0662733263882	1.017462611	3532	3056	3802.4271	2667.7187	2.1704563	1.9552246	-0.1507	-0.15271082878	0.900835712	9049	5092	8647.7208	4540.0894	2.9567193	1.8775501	-0.6551	-0.541066601124	0.635011213	2033	1949	2311.1865	1712.0838	1.3205532	1.2001454	-0.1379	-0.121428794837	0.908820114	9457	5978	8995.2517	5334.8395	3.145895	2.0942813	-0.5870	-0.198924736988	0.665718715	1410	1552	1657.2759	1379.9251	0.5266254	0.5040973	-0.0631	-0.161680568435	0.957221716	4086	4755	4287.2977	4232.5027	1.5974816	1.4549867	-0.1348	-0.216279565057	0.910800317	691	793	839.3777	753.165	0.426894	0.357872	-0.2544	-0.335865687676	0.838315818	3042	5255	3327.4404	4687.9791	1.1232723	1.3426686	0.2574	0.148491892206	1.195318819	1682	2253	1944.9107	1963.8622	0.6169765	0.6443348	0.0626	-0.0104564551599	1.044342520	2629	4226	2915.1634	3730.3078	1.1674755	1.2391923	0.0860	0.00610079122388	1.0614289!sample_table_end
