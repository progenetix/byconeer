Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481663/suppl/GSM481663_JA915.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1502	1240	1399.9384	1351.6511	0.9150763	0.8709729	0.0713	-0.141581463019	1.05063692	1052	924	986.0164	1036.629	0.8608478	0.8416837	0.0325	-0.136918590553	1.02276873	2467	2005	2323.9703	2082.7158	1.0901353	0.9945617	0.1324	-0.0257908324688	1.09609624	3651	4451	3465.8096	4293.0216	1.7146397	2.2212462	-0.3735	-0.503744259755	0.77192695	6416	8014	6136.0308	7744.134	2.7043629	3.5118231	-0.3769	-0.533591596316	0.77007376	8536	5671	8134.7985	5440.0442	3.9778748	2.7640455	0.5252	0.430789351951	1.43914957	2802	1427	2663.1813	1538.083	1.3895121	0.8382387	0.7291	0.727926464873	1.65765698	2599	1789	2459.1579	1879.7565	1.1767642	0.9546668	0.3018	0.41290495515	1.23264389	1801	1336	1681.4528	1448.3975	1.462546	1.1334777	0.3677	0.573031651722	1.290317410	4694	5108	4482.1191	4904.7019	2.3511447	2.6261717	-0.1596	0.0327446564769	0.895274511	13375	11334	12601.657	11129.231	6.333305	5.8090803	0.1246	-0.117943553289	1.090242212	2738	3829	2599.9696	3712.4706	1.1480085	1.7093284	-0.5743	-0.63640895646	0.671613713	3420	4176	3242.7315	4034.9249	1.4985472	1.808068	-0.2709	-0.105534384546	0.828811214	3516	4228	3335.7712	4083.7372	2.8093398	3.1421536	-0.1615	-0.269152058858	0.894080915	4715	3899	4502.7351	3776.7351	1.8753838	1.6036507	0.2258	0.211635004157	1.169446516	2490	2334	2347.5645	2380.7068	1.0437482	1.1198112	-0.1015	0.0424461283096	0.932075117	1020	854	956.1188	964.567	0.7650676	0.7465976	0.0353	-0.100782984491	1.024738818	3382	2606	3206.4383	2622.9979	1.5514426	1.2998568	0.2553	0.347667697047	1.193548819	1435	1315	1338.6975	1427.5246	1.1514814	1.1413044	0.0128	0.0525762928892	1.00891720	793	650	753.5296	750.7318	0.5148733	0.4970299	0.0509	-0.218792240168	1.0359!sample_table_end
