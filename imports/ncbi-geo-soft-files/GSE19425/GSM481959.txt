Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481959/suppl/GSM481959_MR387.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	7498	5767	6519.5854	6406.8584	1.417609	1.4038272	0.0141	-0.245637862717	1.00981732	6405	5811	5658.4775	6458.6107	1.3461171	1.5063639	-0.1623	-0.14269549889	0.89362013	6004	4157	5321.633	4590.5891	1.0376954	0.9232552	0.1686	-0.103376536885	1.12395294	13025	10107	10848.803	11452.174	2.1141444	2.3298163	-0.1401	-0.242117743528	0.90742965	19995	16086	16417.613	18338.853	3.4246598	3.8302927	-0.1615	-0.181767509499	0.89409876	10994	8307	9256.0865	9374.863	1.8918263	1.9766192	-0.0633	-0.197889917782	0.9571027	2468	2566	2263.1319	2871.3177	0.679352	0.7598882	-0.1616	-0.0374315956773	0.89401578	4061	3306	3712.8955	3659.1969	0.7590926	0.7693368	-0.0193	-0.240732454358	0.98668439	9071	8515	7765.7072	9617.641	1.7280098	2.0752408	-0.2642	-0.139947103772	0.832679110	14452	10620	11973.766	12050.093	2.9939012	3.1533372	-0.0749	-0.292031284253	0.949438911	18466	14004	15173.966	15988.386	3.5597178	3.8655278	-0.1189	-0.158268131122	0.920887912	7657	6481	6646.2012	7244.7057	1.8787261	1.8640512	0.0113	-0.0973023850011	1.007872613	5025	4889	4527.5159	5408.9018	1.5520363	1.7412959	-0.1660	-0.105505964313	0.89131114	12242	11300	10232.371	12850.533	2.5104833	3.1407646	-0.3232	-0.137923779984	0.799322315	4367	4551	3971.9903	5023.4611	1.058758	1.2820069	-0.2760	-0.216219832669	0.825859716	3397	3724	3114.0049	4117.16	0.8557437	1.0163929	-0.2482	-0.230875444039	0.841941917	2623	1921	2410.7036	2199.7307	0.5605001	0.5165907	0.1177	0.00465944183028	1.084998218	6451	7440	5696.6662	8361.4277	1.1372653	1.7638144	-0.6331	-0.600367601963	0.644776119	4073	3340	3723.2599	3697.1472	0.8983863	0.8981923	0.0003	-0.205991485539	1.00021620	5269	5157	4731.9172	5710.9669	1.0039905	1.3293861	-0.4050	-0.338590650051	0.7552287!sample_table_end
