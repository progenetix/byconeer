Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481855/suppl/GSM481855_MR251.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5391	5205	5075.0861	5499.7517	1.2674232	1.3914933	-0.1347	-0.169254226665	0.91083672	5274	5131	4967.9246	5420.293	1.3423005	1.46076	-0.1220	0.081425259361	0.91890563	5243	4466	4939.7487	4710.737	1.1589024	1.1026932	0.0717	-0.163499140854	1.05097454	10965	7743	10235.846	8181.7371	2.90708	2.3918479	0.2814	0.191971019612	1.21541175	17915	14141	16800.823	14831.893	3.6956709	3.2660389	0.1783	0.161085611169	1.13154536	11051	9473	10315.595	10000.153	2.4337172	2.3856577	0.0288	0.022433864754	1.02014527	3977	3534	3779.113	3719.0937	0.8238106	0.8210804	0.0048	0.0423935948314	1.00332528	2852	2527	2728.618	2654.1979	0.7468633	0.7527186	-0.0113	0.00778437401742	0.99222119	8674	9415	8094.7732	9938.697	2.1662313	2.6316636	-0.2808	-0.173032115748	0.823141410	11963	10298	11169.124	10856.254	3.6418303	3.6298566	0.0048	0.053051819716	1.003298711	12788	14151	11934.833	14842.265	3.6374744	4.7215234	-0.3763	-0.341018815973	0.770402712	8046	7125	7517.6493	7534.1498	1.9966663	2.1220137	-0.0878	-0.0426167526217	0.9409313	5836	6123	5485.4359	6471.7313	1.8390636	2.1106154	-0.1987	-0.125372194357	0.8713414	11348	9874	10590.984	10416.886	2.7284733	2.6252023	0.0557	0.095737448105	1.039338315	4907	4550	4634.7104	4800.2499	1.2711347	1.3973102	-0.1365	-0.115326955332	0.909701216	4571	4849	4330.4322	5119.3851	1.1078919	1.3138846	-0.2460	-0.160259509239	0.843218617	2417	2456	2314.7754	2581.1724	0.6175677	0.6959706	-0.1724	-0.27920257315	0.887347418	6672	6997	6251.0173	7397.7188	1.1926914	1.3835236	-0.2141	-0.203221442825	0.862067919	4031	3813	3829.6413	4015.1026	1.163002	1.2296061	-0.0803	-0.127625111823	0.94583320	2931	2893	2803.6083	3040.2972	0.8464956	0.9463438	-0.1609	-0.198465787035	0.8944906!sample_table_end
