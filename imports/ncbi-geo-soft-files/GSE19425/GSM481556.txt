Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481556/suppl/GSM481556_EL214.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2825	2873	2948.4381	2728.3981	1.28123	1.161039	-0.1421	0.037083038238	0.90619092	3038	2260	3168.5775	2145.642	1.367847	0.92241	-0.5684	-0.348480419792	0.67435173	1109	832	1162.6519	815.0729	0.5274461	0.3595891	-0.5527	-0.199833944861	0.68175514	6556	6363	6703.0632	6092.363	3.0105787	2.6837984	-0.1658	-0.223710701753	0.89145595	18766	21888	18378.772	21766.154	8.5412608	10.168305	0.2516	-0.0928697137902	1.19049226	8983	9033	9093.4332	8706.7397	4.4132469	4.2192603	-0.0649	-0.143221149168	0.95604447	1279	1130	1344.0953	1090.9929	0.6868018	0.5418882	-0.3419	-0.388193087038	0.78900238	2022	2076	2124.5473	1969.9904	0.9228393	0.8503976	-0.1179	-0.213364447517	0.92150129	4414	4164	4570.7389	3962.3049	1.8358746	1.6031613	-0.1955	-0.0397350666986	0.873241110	7423	7799	7562.2456	7494.3848	4.0621446	3.9874372	-0.0268	-0.0610292251864	0.981608911	9956	8115	10045.346	7802.5649	4.9802444	3.8465514	-0.3727	-0.353210455219	0.772361912	3007	2708	3136.0468	2573.6386	1.5471713	1.2674345	-0.2877	-0.350555200587	0.819194613	1539	1577	1618.0416	1502.4741	0.8155738	0.7391445	-0.1420	-0.0918525990134	0.906287714	6775	6210	6919.7865	5942.7093	3.3181551	2.923354	-0.1828	-0.19799768234	0.881017915	1430	1502	1503.4646	1433.3352	0.6563743	0.6253987	-0.0697	-0.0454773312033	0.95280816	1272	1675	1336.6564	1593.8223	0.6080265	0.70704	0.2177	-0.181411094431	1.16284417	405	314	405.8954	331.8092	0.1840279	0.1502151	-0.2929	-0.0694569067289	0.816262618	3596	3413	3750.4547	3230.2987	1.4881699	1.3339677	-0.1578	-0.129393878793	0.896381319	1599	1583	1682.8437	1508.0663	0.7477836	0.6756404	-0.1464	0.0063738643942	0.903523920	2119	1968	2223.0268	1867.4632	1.0132208	0.8708279	-0.2185	0.0550492945014	0.859465!sample_table_end
