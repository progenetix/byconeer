Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481968/suppl/GSM481968_MR452.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4687	3859	4701.6036	3806.3782	2.0143291	1.6583915	-0.2805	-0.307811384117	0.82329722	1683	1521	1681.2884	1539.585	0.5869302	0.5378362	-0.1260	-0.28635607033	0.91635453	3177	1982	3188.5659	1997.1022	1.4703593	0.9662918	-0.6056	-0.335904764188	0.65718074	6583	4942	6565.9147	4856.3058	2.5409424	1.8818694	-0.4332	-0.450265247893	0.74061865	12222	8397	11957.504	8251.3351	5.048467	3.5690378	-0.5003	-0.479933325636	0.70695476	8447	7570	8382.8975	7439.7587	3.8487003	3.5452386	-0.1185	-0.117656311084	0.92115217	1592	1425	1587.8024	1446.2463	0.922316	0.8563685	-0.1070	-0.131305207438	0.92849788	1961	1571	1963.3022	1587.9645	1.0077177	0.8404832	-0.2618	-0.362535648848	0.83404639	7781	7412	7735.4906	7283.4585	2.0147683	1.8471006	-0.1254	-0.188893643369	0.916780610	14618	11186	14216.934	10997.012	5.2666628	4.0393414	-0.3828	-0.235446161388	0.766964111	7870	5515	7821.2645	5404.6788	4.0021825	2.8476695	-0.4910	-0.497990727802	0.711529112	3526	2203	3537.1844	2206.6781	2.1485595	1.3193315	-0.7036	-0.745481443455	0.614053913	1792	1324	1794.1723	1347.6944	0.9423452	0.6720808	-0.4876	-0.424125418297	0.713200114	10393	7160	10234.577	7032.3913	2.6905216	1.7342287	-0.6336	-0.640319703351	0.644569615	2049	1691	2050.7314	1705.9003	0.6265209	0.5029341	-0.3170	-0.230983770739	0.802741216	1746	1426	1746.7376	1447.2231	0.9229351	0.7423161	-0.3142	-0.350914869635	0.804299417	1190	982	1185.9631	1007.9859	0.4646818	0.4051855	-0.1977	-0.165226111034	0.871963318	7899	5583	7849.3155	5471.0425	2.2593713	1.5472688	-0.5462	-0.471131891531	0.684822719	2071	1581	2072.8735	1597.7419	0.6337685	0.4764356	-0.4117	-0.339635468443	0.751750220	2561	2195	2568.6426	2199.0616	0.868121	0.7364235	-0.2374	-0.201290082657	0.8482959!sample_table_end
