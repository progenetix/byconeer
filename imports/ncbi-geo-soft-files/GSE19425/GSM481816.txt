Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481816/suppl/GSM481816_MR068.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5107	9643	5052.1289	10024.798	1.04508	1.9583036	0.9060	0.750032828407	1.87383122	5018	5654	4969.7395	5754.2383	1.0242423	1.1033902	0.1074	0.186463412206	1.07727453	4457	4523	4455.3088	4559.3065	0.8824192	0.8761456	-0.0103	0.0877037002966	0.99289054	17399	13051	15666.468	13612.509	3.1610717	2.6375416	-0.2612	-0.201704121408	0.8343825	21378	13735	19207.574	14316.569	3.7190198	2.6357239	-0.4967	-0.239399126438	0.70871466	13378	11104	12198.707	11595.57	2.6711977	2.400142	-0.1544	-0.0841658514082	0.89852657	4456	3964	4454.4166	3989.1033	0.8371498	0.7457908	-0.1667	-0.19294235321	0.89086898	4331	4564	4343.3405	4600.9151	0.824836	0.8694221	0.0759	0.0995965732322	1.05405459	5757	7699	5645.062	7949.8049	1.1067609	1.4638669	0.4034	0.352909678122	1.322658610	17130	15581	15431.07	16195.669	3.1208414	3.2306114	0.0499	-0.0200373093304	1.035173211	18683	13698	16819.869	14278.336	3.2840316	2.8254917	-0.2170	-0.0201164967728	0.860372812	11419	9995	10535.698	10409.24	1.9827928	2.076208	0.0664	0.00785095330875	1.047112913	7336	8983	7046.7178	9307.6929	1.455937	1.9982669	0.4568	0.321751729066	1.372495414	16386	16989	14781.75	17626.315	2.7661273	3.0511003	0.1415	0.155129932361	1.103022415	5944	7269	5813.9056	7481.217	1.0524314	1.4930454	0.5045	0.338617921196	1.418662916	5385	7345	5307.3303	7563.4501	0.9814729	1.4502938	0.5633	0.406199439603	1.477670717	1852	2221	1903.602	2244.5641	0.4008808	0.438016	0.1278	0.146669557771	1.092633818	8728	10512	8242.7623	10959.311	1.5074882	1.8689773	0.3101	0.147239610273	1.239795619	3892	5135	3935.8367	5196.023	0.879739	1.1099461	0.3353	0.2390778145	1.261676620	3266	4801	3322.9691	4845.9103	0.7052163	1.0189351	0.5309	0.505605410418	1.4448547!sample_table_end
