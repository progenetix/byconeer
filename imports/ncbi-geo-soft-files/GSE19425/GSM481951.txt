Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481951/suppl/GSM481951_MR377.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4167	5109	4715.1327	4484.1927	1.205351	1.1444969	0.0747	0.0856684388788	1.05317092	6557	7140	6841.0603	6479.7968	1.6820481	1.5467017	0.1210	0.0499748826292	1.08750643	3846	3328	4407.9448	2814.6027	1.1286759	0.7417715	0.6056	0.142477483616	1.5215954	14541	11681	13443.273	10912.567	3.5520801	2.8815312	0.3018	-0.0126976618143	1.23270575	19723	16854	17824.532	15740.059	4.2627189	3.7774502	0.1744	-0.0792775608928	1.12846466	9644	8202	9408.7463	7496.2862	2.6464926	2.1460743	0.3024	0.109249552873	1.23317847	3574	2939	4151.8501	2468.5827	0.9639412	0.5735094	0.7491	0.350702264941	1.68077658	2611	3892	3148.6062	3318.2411	0.7969707	0.8652011	-0.1185	-0.0174019399039	0.92113929	3587	6736	4163.9918	6087.3045	0.9332517	1.3210506	-0.5013	-0.199092349141	0.706446610	12475	12257	11754.25	11465.265	3.3038776	3.3963881	-0.0398	-0.109142243523	0.972762111	16709	19867	15251.744	18325.933	4.048467	4.9911599	-0.3020	-0.21541372089	0.811127412	13435	12459	12532.469	11660.475	3.2446827	2.9684862	0.1283	-0.138209132312	1.093042813	3057	4875	3631.8671	4258.3458	1.0619838	1.2920997	-0.2830	-0.157381905165	0.821905414	15318	16692	14087.744	15596.061	3.5293469	3.8325481	-0.1189	-0.175951356345	0.920887815	3784	5483	4348.401	4853.6064	1.0821671	1.2170402	-0.1695	-0.0805562074363	0.889179416	2985	4904	3553.3016	4285.5113	0.8675927	1.0280271	-0.2448	-0.104756685511	0.843939617	1119	1292	1435.0586	1087.7987	0.354262	0.272469	0.3787	0.228117655102	1.300191718	6001	7765	6384.492	7081.642	1.6115163	1.7659603	-0.1320	-0.0642922280343	0.912543819	2169	3521	2667.5088	2988.4384	0.6675734	0.7652271	-0.1970	-0.108004954462	0.872385920	1543	2535	1945.8754	2117.2264	0.7257866	0.8723257	-0.2653	-0.211253442762	0.8320132!sample_table_end
