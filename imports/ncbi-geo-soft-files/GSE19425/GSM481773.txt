Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481773/suppl/GSM481773_JBH547.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1433	1470	1473.0462	1435.0914	0.8711177	0.8032494	0.1170	-0.0498338779929	1.08449222	1466	1604	1506.1166	1566.9546	1.2150631	1.0610965	0.1955	0.145434083804	1.14510133	1767	1492	1806.9159	1456.6257	0.7789247	0.6343065	0.2963	0.195358308246	1.22799414	9618	8293	9420.3284	8094.9353	3.9622513	3.6025006	0.1373	-0.0868033098005	1.09986135	11395	12638	11115.653	12351.368	4.8807096	5.6761205	-0.2178	0.0549440285065	0.85986716	6597	6907	6504.8664	6738.5202	3.0566653	3.2790631	-0.1013	-0.103685737163	0.93217647	1566	1860	1606.1329	1813.4466	0.7938845	1.0231387	-0.3660	-0.228184534365	0.77593048	2004	2083	2036.3681	2029.1402	0.817373	0.8710856	-0.0918	-0.104321210076	0.93833829	1623	2254	1662.4046	2193.9535	1.2467095	1.3528791	-0.1179	-0.10120686978	0.921523210	6972	7511	6868.6018	7327.9303	3.203442	3.5510363	-0.1486	-0.0156430744088	0.902114711	10044	9304	9828.5112	9087.4774	4.2805598	4.2606381	0.0067	-0.0667480382369	1.004675712	4677	3679	4638.2522	3590.2769	2.1228195	1.8861517	0.1705	0.0478393201727	1.125476513	1734	1970	1773.9055	1921.1559	0.9244462	1.0392577	-0.1689	-0.00572800631047	0.889525514	4173	5123	4151.9807	5000.7279	3.3246324	3.1279357	0.0880	0.0232834606236	1.062883815	1861	1785	1900.3479	1740.4812	0.8049634	0.7983289	0.0119	0.0971127786424	1.008310316	1595	1766	1634.7719	1722.0333	0.7455198	0.9023253	-0.2754	0.0848248817263	0.826220717	370	510	395.76634	506.5575	0.3189768	0.3567182	-0.1613	0.0811039771081	0.894198218	2771	3238	2796.5358	3167.6378	1.364454	1.4667911	-0.1043	-0.071816112706	0.930230519	648	829	694.12869	816.9032	0.5388417	0.5538655	-0.0397	0.0644147962911	0.972874620	1633	1413	1672.2687	1379.581	0.8369871	0.6625315	0.3372	0.101922723726	1.2633166!sample_table_end
