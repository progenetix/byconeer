Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481690/suppl/GSM481690_JBH088.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2223	2671	2456.7295	2407.7833	0.9280939	0.9035576	-0.0387	0.0996403324709	0.97356272	2535	2976	2783.5565	2688.3547	1.2521915	1.233371	-0.0218	0.00436058551882	0.98496983	3393	3605	3647.4451	3281.2436	1.3211967	1.1640702	-0.1827	-0.0627594253588	0.88107254	9606	8417	9420.7776	8050.8745	3.32549	2.9341185	-0.1806	-0.205106329796	0.88231165	11818	12135	11386.842	11832.168	4.8338239	4.6996841	-0.0406	-0.117722696225	0.97224976	8255	8648	8203.3557	8284.657	3.2760802	3.1445921	-0.0591	-0.0559667419022	0.95986427	3604	3765	3854.1345	3436.1634	1.615175	1.3781893	-0.2289	-0.192807806632	0.85327558	2287	2480	2524.0585	2233.8132	0.8755069	0.8389454	-0.0615	0.00114807259237	0.95823959	2322	2321	2560.8413	2083.8731	1.1239933	0.9586033	-0.2296	-0.107347653305	0.852854910	6379	6641	6492.7003	6259.739	2.4352155	2.4054734	-0.0177	-0.068191156005	0.987786611	12007	9983	11556.952	9642.9341	4.0724203	3.6644454	-0.1523	-0.0818647399865	0.8998212	5103	5798	5302.3774	5412.039	1.9738837	2.0514049	0.0556	-0.13773511076	1.039273413	2427	3742	2670.632	3414.1473	1.0727547	1.3329009	0.3132	0.179995943612	1.242502914	4922	6599	5130.4846	6217.1174	2.8133661	2.9090669	0.0483	-0.00145927360501	1.034016415	3401	4048	3655.057	3705.4918	1.229031	1.3004132	0.0814	0.164303583094	1.058079916	1762	2462	1967.4145	2216.6695	0.7154595	0.7992498	0.1598	0.0446408777989	1.117113817	771	883	880.0051	821.4938	0.3844194	0.3588485	-0.0993	0.0465399524437	0.933481618	3040	4918	3300.4569	4540.8515	1.7840497	1.9392768	0.1204	0.0615789409094	1.087008219	2009	1995	2228.9688	1792.1535	0.9848313	0.8793128	-0.1635	0.00676090481876	0.892856320	1332	1454	1502.0615	1316.8279	0.5575674	0.4948491	-0.1722	-0.000650239325551	0.8875142!sample_table_end
