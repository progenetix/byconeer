Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481549/suppl/GSM481549_EL171.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2488	1800	2307.0696	1932.8152	1.2008929	0.9862094	0.2841	0.0761206790776	1.21768542	1016	827	922.0066	931.8253	0.5111079	0.5177315	-0.0186	-0.110742726072	0.98720663	2062	1695	1899.4049	1827.9982	0.99896	0.9264189	0.1088	-0.0277346087187	1.07830264	11536	15593	10705.061	15270.082	5.1299484	7.5438735	-0.5564	-0.729884029496	0.68001515	10600	20700	9859.2565	20105.23	6.6788149	12.802618	-0.9388	-0.259386780739	0.52167576	7548	7098	7034.8732	7134.8225	4.447877	4.3869462	0.0199	-0.0346966187303	1.01388917	1307	1978	1196.5547	2114.8441	0.7229568	1.1556669	-0.6767	-0.416583299622	0.62557548	2432	2108	2254.2992	2249.6602	1.0936213	1.1245097	-0.0402	-0.0406001123241	0.97253169	3790	3649	3514.3267	3795.3299	1.8181074	1.9443854	-0.0969	-0.167769503876	0.93505510	8515	8347	7934.9666	8336.2516	4.2177424	4.6548807	-0.1423	-0.0550791112057	0.906090311	10578	12703	9839.5403	12500.288	4.8444679	6.537911	-0.4325	-0.581355997124	0.74098112	4058	4263	3772.9479	4393.4783	2.0409748	2.3372651	-0.1956	-0.377803736652	0.87323213	2079	1692	1915.5101	1825.0031	1.0018456	0.9968323	0.0072	-0.0304545208133	1.005029214	4346	5192	4046.9138	5290.4973	3.8747682	4.6787871	-0.2720	-0.376376085604	0.828156515	1471	1260	1348.2478	1383.4591	0.7083745	0.7067146	0.0034	-0.0242716859155	1.002348816	1732	2065	1593.5966	2204.8385	0.8183475	1.1012607	-0.4284	-0.182731889723	0.743100517	443	333	373.3651	406.4844	0.2159687	0.2347402	-0.1202	-0.192416655572	0.920032918	1799	1666	1654.8902	1798.9611	1.563697	1.5515236	0.0113	-0.13522365054	1.007846119	1470	1095	1347.2973	1212.0993	0.7357563	0.6811916	0.1112	0.0338754302369	1.080101720	2590	1670	2401.1392	1802.9732	1.1136108	0.9307932	0.2587	-0.0621863675617	1.1964105!sample_table_end
