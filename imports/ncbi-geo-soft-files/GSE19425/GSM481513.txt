Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481513/suppl/GSM481513_DE432.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2981	4353	3670.5034	3567.4232	0.7101848	0.6799122	0.0628	0.0133584892288	1.04452432	3869	4678	4666.9422	3857.6021	1.2353424	0.9011765	0.4550	0.378599846907	1.37081073	5995	6099	6867.4032	5121.1967	1.1398895	0.8550912	0.4147	0.405652496914	1.33306194	18100	15909	16559.922	14959.002	3.0295464	2.8660528	0.0800	0.0437955128234	1.05704485	28202	19672	23207.08	18846.883	3.754433	3.0441609	0.3026	0.264839890475	1.23332276	14918	22806	14320.57	22019.45	2.5429528	3.9578332	-0.6382	-0.678740639585	0.64251137	6477	9391	7341.1084	8281.7184	1.2825958	1.3829931	-0.1087	-0.168762565703	0.92740588	3869	5163	4666.9422	4274.3969	0.9357483	0.8887611	0.0743	0.195935392543	1.05286819	3636	5243	4404.3437	4340.827	1.1293615	0.9723029	0.2160	-0.0173976031094	1.161532510	8143	11321	8900.8293	10239.448	2.2485946	2.9431109	-0.3883	-0.534316077835	0.764019611	14039	13399	13684.815	12394.059	3.0888976	3.0958174	-0.0032	-0.0765372153268	0.997764812	18038	16739	16517.337	15803.216	3.3068757	3.1477151	0.0712	0.226385587224	1.050563813	4449	6483	5281.4435	5474.4246	1.1981987	1.3603198	-0.1831	-0.189752449599	0.880821314	11765	14239	11967.007	13252.651	3.0169071	2.4511167	0.2996	0.151476471359	1.230829615	3766	4903	4550.6273	4056.7364	0.8843507	0.8141438	0.1193	0.0158347963407	1.08623416	3532	5122	4287.7107	4240.3487	0.7939373	0.7852598	0.0159	0.0426056782661	1.011050417	1464	2245	1926.4572	1818.7776	0.4658506	0.4084345	0.1898	0.0477606039183	1.14057618	7688	14827	8480.9441	13849.983	1.4358679	2.1239818	-0.5648	-0.506103084978	0.676026419	2025	3448	2585.4641	2817.7356	0.6743921	0.7115885	-0.0775	-0.107725855578	0.947727720	1444	2089	1902.6283	1691.0292	0.4383546	0.4350299	0.0110	-0.0647319755309	1.0076423!sample_table_end
