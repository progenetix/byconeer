Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481594/suppl/GSM481594_EL656.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2224	1741	2198.8676	1764.1147	0.8775503	0.6702246	-0.3888	-0.102782952084	0.76374492	2575	2570	2544.6726	2586.7515	1.5542797	1.3527495	-0.2004	0.0144861294855	0.87033853	1622	1222	1601.5267	1253.9953	0.5582443	0.4537996	-0.2988	-0.210925018855	0.8129054	17574	14315	16914.34	14218.168	5.634242	5.1558405	-0.1280	-0.109910213707	0.91509035	12580	16512	12219.362	16401.619	5.1232217	6.7525841	0.3984	-0.102584494157	1.31803476	9948	10695	9721.7812	10627.266	3.9664392	4.4093088	0.1527	0.0955175057434	1.11165417	2041	2239	2017.1305	2263.2334	0.9704205	1.0282368	0.0835	-0.0314933544971	1.05957868	2169	2276	2144.3194	2299.0276	0.7726	0.925284	0.2602	0.0223146853602	1.19762369	2169	2264	2144.3194	2287.4202	1.2780428	1.1844761	-0.1097	0.00399879738813	0.92678910	13288	12418	12897.606	12323.882	5.7749615	5.6824582	-0.0233	-0.0712287307576	0.98398211	4800	3815	4728.0243	3818.5036	1.9305529	1.6278646	-0.2460	-0.238320954426	0.843211612	7501	6280	7357.902	6254.1478	3.061975	2.680941	-0.1917	-0.147130357654	0.875559413	1369	1060	1354.7799	1094.1766	0.6352751	0.5366512	-0.2434	-0.132281619045	0.84475414	3124	2919	3079.9953	2933.412	1.9001344	1.6102071	-0.2389	-0.0218296945987	0.847417515	1571	1222	1553.2806	1253.9953	0.5772447	0.4954234	-0.2205	-0.0615321294705	0.858255416	1340	1428	1325.3952	1459.0747	0.5510615	0.6121082	0.1516	-0.144373333624	1.110780217	277	197	231.02631	240.4434	0.1340675	0.1177256	-0.1875	-0.10516518244	0.878107418	3732	3686	3679.1527	3688.6174	1.6910397	1.4880431	-0.1845	-0.0775632854426	0.879957519	928	870	915.01647	904.8255	0.5310905	0.4543209	-0.2252	-0.137089368143	0.855449220	3215	2747	3169.3692	2761.4048	1.1710587	1.0542875	-0.1515	-0.0471770888608	0.9002857!sample_table_end
