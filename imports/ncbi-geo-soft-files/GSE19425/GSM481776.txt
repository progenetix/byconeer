Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481776/suppl/GSM481776_JBH550.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1349	1270	1370.1079	1242.3756	1.0064246	0.9578081	-0.0714	0.0029421156597	0.95169372	1376	1472	1396.4415	1434.4968	1.3142471	1.2323605	-0.0928	0.0472919858409	0.93769313	1306	1312	1328.6515	1283.2934	0.6761073	0.764533	0.1773	0.164578932137	1.13078644	7731	5507	7418.9495	5344.1989	3.936295	3.2662184	-0.2692	0.0135497300331	0.82976975	13129	12116	12332.3	11920.159	6.2136935	7.2033609	0.2132	0.0186700630461	1.1592726	5779	4571	5598.9047	4434.4404	3.0971305	2.8976844	-0.0960	-0.0651663328558	0.93560297	1261	1178	1285.28	1151.766	0.9768405	0.9780219	0.0017	-0.0060734848006	1.00120958	1580	1324	1594.1674	1294.6431	0.8744061	0.7573843	-0.2073	-0.0911268499543	0.86616999	2048	2253	2053.5123	2189.6768	1.7982825	1.7211824	-0.0632	0.00218028366461	0.957125610	4885	6073	4752.1547	5896.429	3.4457446	3.7445428	0.1200	-0.0375165263371	1.086715111	9553	9929	9088.2227	9729.8507	6.0716533	6.3429569	0.0631	0.143667563481	1.044683612	2924	2608	2893.5603	2526.9607	1.8571637	1.6850303	-0.1403	0.063934719801	0.907313813	1127	1851	1157.7249	1797.9937	1.0471532	1.2489464	0.2542	0.00874201646808	1.192706514	3435	3962	3386.3023	3839.9325	3.4042085	3.2241265	-0.0784	0.0986188477519	0.947100115	1389	1490	1409.1143	1451.5495	0.8409068	0.8474678	0.0112	-0.043350848818	1.007802216	1108	1465	1139.4962	1427.8635	0.7142827	0.9831474	0.4609	0.0343557513998	1.376412117	429	540	467.99741	537.99842	0.4383059	0.4789614	0.1280	-0.0177285949447	1.092756118	2807	2689	2781.7174	2603.8082	1.6114466	1.578012	-0.0302	-0.0131541627568	0.979251719	617	886	654.71186	871.94487	0.6188715	0.7626059	0.3013	-0.0277179458071	1.232252520	1088	1074	1119.2497	1050.6294	0.9040308	0.6989421	-0.3712	-0.0430683878862	0.7731396!sample_table_end
