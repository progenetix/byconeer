Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481848/suppl/GSM481848_MR234.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	7928	7519	7772.4569	7589.5993	1.3383703	1.2864775	-0.0571	-0.0379188451815	0.96122682	7064	7794	6945.0018	7864.5037	1.2233084	1.3748703	0.1685	0.0132974526343	1.12389513	7803	5439	7653.6712	5473.5371	1.4234624	1.0518306	-0.4365	-0.141951333118	0.7389244	11562	9936	11260.741	10023.871	2.3189606	2.1193641	-0.1298	-0.0727846439123	0.91392855	17983	17454	17388.296	17701.919	3.2587359	3.401018	0.0617	0.0227873676376	1.04366186	12339	12007	12004.511	12142.067	2.2858652	2.3452885	0.0370	0.134849673178	1.0259967	4685	4323	4662.4624	4343.8832	0.8175621	0.7006031	-0.2227	0.0274797891428	0.85694188	3257	3484	3290.6134	3494.9249	0.624237	0.6897995	0.1441	0.04878720666	1.10502829	13455	11694	13062.763	11823.787	2.1690988	1.9538156	-0.1508	-0.00215459961509	0.900749910	17539	16005	16965.471	16217.23	3.172503	3.0720606	-0.0464	-0.0427157052578	0.968339711	27669	24731	26433.825	25343.942	4.8355795	4.781135	-0.0163	-0.0322783891135	0.988740812	13623	11529	13223.588	11654.883	2.1338882	1.883392	-0.1802	-0.278330335611	0.882610413	12144	11518	11817.711	11643.507	2.0439954	1.8624404	-0.1342	-0.0671716973328	0.911176414	17437	15795	16868.333	16002.496	2.8388673	2.717775	-0.0629	-0.0658224177556	0.957344915	8935	7825	8732.9097	7895.3824	1.3405875	1.232234	-0.1216	-0.0663782354102	0.919174616	7874	8913	7721.148	8991.5209	1.2865207	1.4207129	0.1431	-0.0252688564843	1.104306317	4947	3321	4913.1239	3327.6562	0.8425453	0.5676851	-0.5697	-0.160645310618	0.67377418	8763	8910	8568.5013	8988.4772	1.4117309	1.4486669	0.0373	-0.0347458602748	1.026163619	7906	6594	7751.5525	6656.4709	1.3806826	1.1823067	-0.2238	-0.0498201387819	0.856320420	3221	2675	3255.9572	2677.4129	0.7404559	0.6463312	-0.1961	-0.0453209310784	0.8728828!sample_table_end
