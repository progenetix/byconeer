Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481812/suppl/GSM481812_MR064.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	7225	5943	6921.0603	6060.069	1.4513281	1.2861443	-0.1743	-0.123261425352	0.88618442	4431	3837	4382.1842	3857.4991	0.9266285	0.8285201	-0.1615	-0.221370588172	0.89412323	4949	3372	4848.9105	3371.2095	1.0707879	0.7804762	-0.4562	-0.206887358738	0.72888034	10500	5895	9900.875	6011.2063	2.3272279	1.4113323	-0.7216	-0.595890927295	0.60644355	16596	9452	15596.567	9696.5402	3.5684247	2.2216028	-0.6837	-0.51529001996	0.62257246	11394	8207	10727.494	8397.6284	2.4910015	2.0373631	-0.2900	-0.245520921695	0.81788927	3740	3105	3746.2223	3103.4298	0.818732	0.6952585	-0.2358	-0.207745683407	0.84918938	2723	2610	2798.3246	2602.9045	0.6286342	0.6012964	-0.0641	-0.126356014302	0.95651249	9729	9229	9196.0359	9467.3143	1.8507786	1.9587468	0.0818	0.024101768975	1.058336610	18981	17819	17844.84	18302.721	3.8716491	3.7350471	-0.0518	-0.0840508783718	0.964717411	22392	20460	21077.617	21048.068	4.4608331	4.3993074	-0.0200	-0.0508306632784	0.986207612	9397	7784	8892.2346	7957.5722	1.7699049	1.4077094	-0.3303	-0.398574536	0.795358813	8591	8909	8148.464	9134.3362	1.8444289	1.8801084	0.0276	0.00936623606181	1.019344514	14203	10412	13344.853	10686.986	2.7094597	2.3738233	-0.1908	-0.30119965284	0.876124215	6895	7339	6624.2626	7496.1433	1.2662542	1.302278	0.0405	0.0301298129769	1.028449116	5325	6539	5191.8374	6671.323	1.0217365	1.1641006	0.1882	-0.015796071118	1.139335417	2668	2582	2745.4658	2574.7667	0.585135	0.5508688	-0.0871	-0.047308152935	0.941438818	7108	6073	6815.4814	6192.4008	1.4346436	1.3527312	-0.0848	-0.171730859732	0.94290419	5676	4957	5521.8774	5025.1045	1.1630549	1.0993996	-0.0812	-0.0536656192381	0.945268920	2314	2224	2397.7011	2213.885	0.5843432	0.5352812	-0.1265	-0.0409282485387	0.9160391!sample_table_end
