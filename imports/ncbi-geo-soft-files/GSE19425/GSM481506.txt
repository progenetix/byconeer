Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481506/suppl/GSM481506_DE423.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4863	2966	4264.6004	3372.6405	1.0329689	0.8210418	-0.3313	-0.0423902971402	0.79483682	2981	3156	2630.2572	3586.215	0.6912014	1.0111469	0.5488	0.475257373296	1.46288323	6759	4851	5995.5306	5432.2315	1.3209402	1.2234081	-0.1107	0.036996842681	0.92616464	14659	15563	13478.769	15759.825	3.3969494	3.9721192	0.2257	0.167360882498	1.16931955	23683	24172	20525.872	24181.214	4.9351831	5.9166241	0.2617	0.231995735996	1.19886616	17858	12878	16182.283	13208.426	3.7460976	3.0962185	-0.2749	-0.335975090007	0.82651837	3599	2673	3157.9014	3049.6972	0.9867579	0.912306	-0.1132	-0.254684366404	0.9245498	2287	2214	2036.5022	2535.8641	0.547971	0.6777014	0.3066	0.159553497238	1.23674699	6109	3869	5392.1426	4382.4934	1.3554147	1.1982082	-0.1779	-0.0313628051058	0.884015910	18284	11107	16519.463	11548.38	5.6014312	3.8840204	-0.5282	-0.267166581517	0.693397811	31510	19872	26072.224	19909.029	8.3745458	6.355664	-0.3980	-0.158579710211	0.758926412	8941	10838	8110.3899	11294.738	2.3990646	3.2112044	0.4206	0.150540180565	1.338523513	10057	5390	9182.1722	5984.9848	2.9221054	1.8048281	-0.6951	-0.264931758172	0.617646414	12565	10889	11556.158	11342.871	2.8628536	3.0488304	0.0908	0.09091926461	1.06496215	7526	4620	6744.2485	5191.1889	1.9546143	1.4496498	-0.4312	-0.0862598620624	0.741655116	4720	3344	4136.5945	3798.4077	1.1904421	1.0448919	-0.1881	-0.056772278695	0.877734317	4091	2397	3584.5327	2740.7007	0.895268	0.7142018	-0.3260	-0.217090437178	0.797751918	9686	6203	8826.9987	6825.4007	1.9859789	1.5798635	-0.3301	-0.227168577133	0.795508619	6093	3411	5377.6248	3873.8159	1.4378199	1.0963167	-0.3912	-0.257573954805	0.762485420	2498	1631	2219.5897	1861.1338	0.6509836	0.5556476	-0.2285	-0.0016066427131	0.8535508!sample_table_end
