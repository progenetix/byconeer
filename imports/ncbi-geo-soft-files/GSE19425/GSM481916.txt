Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481916/suppl/GSM481916_MR330.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6399	4577	6191.6036	4687.7645	1.466598	1.0719022	-0.4523	0.0110266867407	0.73087662	5072	5585	4901.6438	5693.8853	1.3275611	1.4676366	0.1447	0.0658682646331	1.10551333	5335	3832	5155.0759	3956.6333	1.2166667	0.9109065	-0.4176	0.0279146991454	0.74869024	13837	13348	13232.293	13522.093	3.0487877	3.1277219	0.0369	-0.152354224025	1.02589035	17740	17584	16867.175	17936.856	4.3122411	4.4068783	0.0313	-0.112261678429	1.02194616	9745	10776	9393.5137	10895.242	2.3699925	2.6720895	0.1731	0.0453616071768	1.12746757	2750	3049	2649.9311	3170.7267	0.7274601	0.8655643	0.2508	0.075920583532	1.18984448	3643	3182	3512.0986	3306.7012	0.794015	0.7647787	-0.0541	-0.0391927381869	0.9631799	5992	5851	5791.2007	5959.3267	1.4958256	1.4578553	-0.0371	-0.122480820181	0.974615810	12160	9363	11645.995	9479.4748	3.1188923	2.6637455	-0.2276	-0.146228736289	0.854067711	21864	18088	20673.941	18463.184	5.0875224	4.8396218	-0.0721	-0.117555479135	0.951272812	10758	12133	10335.861	12274.045	2.6177954	3.2163899	0.2971	-0.0823561429748	1.228663613	6534	4898	6324.4429	5004.64	1.8625066	1.5751867	-0.2417	-0.104907515522	0.845734814	11135	12293	10683.501	12438.225	3.3941078	3.555152	0.0669	-0.212934859299	1.047448115	5562	4257	5372.4628	4379.6272	1.2976639	1.0968832	-0.2425	-0.00212080494016	0.845275216	4140	3673	3990.9641	3798.8134	0.9826738	0.9695425	-0.0194	-0.128377565922	0.986637117	2415	2054	2332.4176	2166.2684	0.6102437	0.5454197	-0.1620	0.0645998018102	0.893773518	5876	5480	5677.4234	5589.2911	1.5658824	1.3977939	-0.1638	-0.146732484937	0.892655619	3886	3019	3742.5121	3140.2786	0.9812823	0.7992079	-0.2961	-0.0411968560703	0.814452520	3065	2162	2946.7023	2276.9786	0.7568382	0.6200993	-0.2875	-0.0758556214939	0.8193287!sample_table_end
