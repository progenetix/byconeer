Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481864/suppl/GSM481864_MR268.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4885	4720	4964.5998	4615.2107	1.2555987	1.1654912	-0.1074	-0.040593152982	0.92823542	6195	6345	6249.7298	6226.6588	1.7417775	1.6948206	-0.0394	0.0886921045969	0.97304093	4586	4488	4665.5938	4386.2398	1.0319943	0.9940312	-0.0541	-0.0118703018322	0.96321384	12637	12530	12520.988	12380.91	2.8484731	2.9012462	0.0265	0.151661292931	1.01852685	18815	16276	18552.708	16111.31	4.2247528	3.6478968	-0.2118	-0.0482299776052	0.8634586	10382	10649	10342.083	10509.586	2.4310089	2.510486	0.0464	0.0738617658622	1.0326937	2806	2895	2886.3601	2825.6835	0.8041637	0.7810185	-0.0421	-0.0312682843395	0.97121838	3037	2999	3118.8494	2928.0862	0.755114	0.7151887	-0.0784	-0.0807706689159	0.94712689	7525	8169	7563.1039	8044.8112	1.9767798	2.0639026	0.0622	-0.0583745174617	1.044073110	12110	14147	12013.73	13990.902	3.6023756	4.1614509	0.2081	0.128832759886	1.155196311	19737	18360	19449.617	18203.689	5.3357058	5.134787	-0.0554	-0.0880855183541	0.962344512	11048	10505	10986.592	10365.217	2.9068839	2.7393977	-0.0856	-0.0713956808732	0.942382913	3156	3456	3238.8156	3374.5226	1.3670662	1.2992652	-0.0734	-0.132342877227	0.950404114	12276	12294	12173.442	12143.237	3.0721698	2.920597	-0.0730	-0.00721219809907	0.950662615	4323	4798	4405.5955	4693.101	1.0999494	1.1884431	0.1116	0.0512345431536	1.080452616	3905	4565	3993.5645	4460.5083	1.0377426	1.1663104	0.1685	-0.0069558740786	1.123891817	1517	1759	1572.8324	1723.1981	0.4318858	0.464833	0.1061	-0.00279231004817	1.076286918	7351	7922	7390.7517	7797.291	1.4787873	1.5631062	0.0800	-0.0621102592052	1.057018919	3266	3877	3349.271	3787.9207	0.9276841	1.0189747	0.1354	0.0719892822828	1.09840720	2357	2380	2433.9942	2320.5608	0.6917689	0.6693452	-0.0475	0.0339501166576	0.967585!sample_table_end
