Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481718/suppl/GSM481718_JBH216.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2802	3513	2778.3848	3531.6969	0.801375	0.9995815	0.3188	0.288242314979	1.2473332	4655	4418	4662.7159	4398.3833	1.589653	1.4795895	-0.1035	0.0618336969091	0.93076253	3806	3776	3803.1996	3781.3878	0.9345497	0.9154567	-0.0298	0.277310181744	0.97956984	15059	12562	14688.217	12470.484	3.6878404	3.1630588	-0.2215	-0.173288056867	0.85769945	20571	15936	19730.053	15939.561	4.3310089	3.5621453	-0.2820	-0.300620808267	0.82247476	8896	8010	8848.0184	7894.1024	2.3854789	2.0761546	-0.2004	-0.256748269718	0.87033037	4044	3872	4047.6742	3872.6339	0.719574	0.7116701	-0.0159	-0.193018627679	0.98901588	2629	2707	2601.2096	2758.9752	0.6031633	0.6501663	0.1083	-0.0137340806369	1.07792749	2785	2654	2760.7254	2708.1235	0.9220286	0.9005724	-0.0340	-0.0327801205133	0.976729310	15124	13017	14747.478	12936.965	2.8992764	2.6017125	-0.1562	-0.0747273968344	0.897366111	15922	15972	15474.78	15977.122	3.1446516	3.4073225	0.1157	0.141455418698	1.083529412	6198	9516	6213.5669	9388.5968	1.294081	1.8807211	0.5394	0.282830480776	1.453325613	4872	4554	4884.9048	4531.5289	0.8909471	0.8523665	-0.0639	0.206760985098	0.95669714	7754	7986	7743.27	7870.5737	2.5823488	2.5207957	-0.0348	-0.0443146141747	0.976163915	5294	5805	5302.5241	5732.7394	1.1458298	1.1435634	-0.0029	0.192641110526	0.99802216	6279	5596	6293.5651	5532.847	1.1696221	1.0618146	-0.1395	-0.0369269862045	0.90782717	1135	1062	1099.6414	1152.1874	0.3697933	0.3767813	0.0270	0.514060232421	1.01889718	5449	5572	5457.5144	5509.8786	1.2806496	1.2571413	-0.0267	-0.0976262015178	0.981643519	2674	2459	2646.8107	2516.7658	0.8511875	0.8063119	-0.0781	0.113301369444	0.947278820	3921	3863	3921.4533	3864.0345	0.8156587	0.8300519	0.0252	0.0661964024016	1.0176461!sample_table_end
