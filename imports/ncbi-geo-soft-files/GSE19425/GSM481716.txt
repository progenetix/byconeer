Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481716/suppl/GSM481716_JBH214.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3338	3601	3589.51	3308.5465	1.2746538	1.0937015	-0.2209	-0.0807885663033	0.8580382	1392	2358	1632.6881	2180.6399	0.6421341	0.841368	0.3899	0.478707722386	1.31026843	5708	6301	5881.8603	5842.1794	1.8105417	1.6031831	-0.1755	0.388474024551	0.88547154	5640	6208	5817.2944	5751.4951	1.8234989	1.6226951	-0.1683	-0.22640398971	0.88987995	12699	12278	12533.532	11682.47	3.1084032	2.7280116	-0.1883	-0.482067041192	0.87762476	5717	11067	5890.5725	10474.575	1.9683941	3.025838	0.6203	0.613051711981	1.53721147	4112	6805	4347.5883	6317.7455	0.8151662	1.1090395	0.4441	0.728721347166	1.36050728	2121	4128	2377.1154	3808.644	0.7327351	1.0178728	0.4742	0.329599420562	1.38914169	3327	4146	3578.9376	3824.5681	1.3463302	1.4138891	0.0706	0.0416720816309	1.0501810	18869	22125	18492.613	21485.117	4.7148438	5.630847	0.2561	0.351366788655	1.194280711	19877	20325	19456.853	19687.8	5.3078059	5.2397051	-0.0186	0.115717927652	0.987169612	3983	5894	4226.7869	5446.8448	1.009463	1.2451646	0.3027	0.18558317852	1.23349213	8556	6639	8559.101	6163.3431	1.6993759	1.5779105	-0.1070	0.0590075766756	0.928523514	4479	5088	4697.1712	4677.9395	1.8337993	1.8770586	0.0336	0.0226352683353	1.023589915	4641	5044	4859.5627	4637.2526	1.2517595	1.1233859	-0.1561	0.142002431818	0.897445516	7507	7927	7588.4558	7378.3922	1.5480028	1.4270139	-0.1174	0.108188541542	0.921841917	1736	1563	1983.3822	1472.9655	0.7503976	0.5307544	-0.4996	0.0306202807234	0.707297618	6358	7804	6507.3359	7260.801	1.834582	1.8775673	0.0334	-0.0309769616731	1.023430519	4515	4501	4732.1293	4136.847	1.6549788	1.5387873	-0.1050	-0.00583854057634	0.929792720	2891	2872	3143.9914	2643.3182	0.8089279	0.7259884	-0.1561	0.0552567487924	0.8974698!sample_table_end
