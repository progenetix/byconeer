Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481588/suppl/GSM481588_EL650.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1971	1108	1766.6789	1285.9691	0.8557366	0.6202636	-0.4643	-0.193588678183	0.72483012	2044	1544	1838.7915	1715.5856	1.0269786	0.9685428	-0.0845	-0.0336606158453	0.94309933	2195	1416	1988.2617	1590.0587	0.9036551	0.7090413	-0.3499	0.00641609203212	0.78463714	13121	11248	12714.987	11193.277	6.5697647	5.8116342	-0.1769	-0.0473307981733	0.88460315	5797	9820	5584.5704	9787.3463	3.0503713	5.0663401	0.7320	0.0336603681174	1.66089296	10073	8828	9771.3703	8810.7499	4.936979	4.3398657	-0.1860	0.00740564585374	0.87905297	860	881	683.1076	1048.916	0.5723465	0.8344446	0.5439	0.143353187252	1.45793598	1785	1390	1582.2979	1564.4975	0.9357868	0.933405	-0.0037	-0.010649858579	0.99745479	2598	1942	2388.5481	2108.2723	1.3227903	1.1830769	-0.1610	-0.0331333199879	0.894379810	7247	6868	7011.0565	6890.5413	4.7945264	4.8253423	0.0092	0.0406526042968	1.006427311	4001	2201	3782.6755	2360.1263	2.7144884	1.7071412	-0.6691	-0.244515008134	0.628899812	4341	3675	4124.8158	3790.2515	3.149238	2.8769964	-0.1304	0.0188537660889	0.913553213	1167	786	969.0083	947.1066	0.8793593	0.8476234	-0.0530	0.0507160745339	0.963910214	3873	4082	3654.9106	4182.4426	1.8536859	1.9698811	0.0877	0.0708271537443	1.062683315	1647	960	1447.2438	1132.4015	1.0695764	0.8281626	-0.3691	-0.0986853369642	0.774290316	1414	1124	1217.9312	1302.0854	0.9574991	0.9952072	0.0557	0.00466361214929	1.039381917	1082	521	887.8663	676.2501	0.4861727	0.3765128	-0.3688	-0.085440344175	0.774442518	4022	3216	3803.6675	3354.1104	1.6933434	1.3880199	-0.2868	-0.121605203989	0.819691919	1553	1108	1354.0708	1285.9691	0.8237761	0.8029265	-0.0370	0.0666626403434	0.974690220	2335	1536	2125.7643	1707.7747	1.2755305	1.0705833	-0.2527	-0.0588229386191	0.839324!sample_table_end
