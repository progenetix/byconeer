Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481609/suppl/GSM481609_EL675.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2996	2936	3175.5443	2761.7735	0.7140401	0.699582	0.0295	-0.126402753626	1.02066682	3947	3857	4160.4273	3639.6408	1.1147386	1.0061677	0.1478	0.0601536617497	1.10790533	2580	2334	2743.4975	2198.4398	0.6107437	0.5534776	0.1420	0.0480479532954	1.10346584	17011	17193	16897.862	16480.549	3.874948	4.3123173	-0.1543	-0.282276056096	0.89857675	12342	25485	12471.531	24719.362	3.4562643	6.8491617	-0.9867	-0.374423046475	0.50462586	11075	11903	11241.405	11292.982	2.7481979	3.1810242	-0.2110	-0.225729403294	0.86393497	1460	3400	1595.5614	3201.6989	0.7503503	1.1770948	-0.6496	-0.246735213052	0.63745958	2646	3297	2812.2201	3104.1876	0.6931398	0.8252503	-0.2517	-0.144817449294	0.83991469	3693	4216	3893.3861	3981.6538	0.9777972	1.0227046	-0.0648	-0.0986429782411	0.956089610	16607	19515	16527.689	18776.844	4.5771977	5.2463486	-0.1968	-0.175750983185	0.872453911	9039	11575	9254.3388	10974.623	2.5143852	3.0094006	-0.2593	-0.167218537281	0.835510312	5617	6611	5834.6626	6235.2513	2.2840354	2.0638036	0.1463	-0.155300595949	1.106711613	1354	2018	1483.504	1899.4556	0.5447381	0.5676973	-0.0596	-0.0630794080816	0.959557314	6167	7588	6390.4799	7184.2492	2.0275277	2.2156128	-0.1280	-0.273553122787	0.915109215	2014	2255	2165.8439	2122.7245	0.6977713	0.6160636	0.1797	0.0331252514197	1.132628616	1421	2191	1554.3801	2061.6557	0.643921	0.7191037	-0.1593	0.0481235840732	0.895449417	529	618	574.52344	609.85944	0.1505479	0.1691619	-0.1682	-0.00536624723311	0.889963118	4580	5078	4793.4428	4788.7092	1.3012865	1.351754	-0.0549	-0.182232111887	0.962665119	2409	2295	2565.1909	2161.0561	0.6403615	0.5840867	0.1327	0.0221345481154	1.096346620	3593	3349	3788.8853	3153.4894	0.9211072	0.8122224	0.1815	-0.100845178515	1.1340578!sample_table_end
