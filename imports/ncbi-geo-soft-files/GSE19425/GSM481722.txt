Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481722/suppl/GSM481722_JBH220.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5877	5388	5486.4352	5727.914	1.0413552	0.9637413	-0.1117	0.0950471297205	0.92546832	3989	4245	3716.7819	4578.9237	0.8913977	0.9711275	0.1236	0.24096234315	1.08944353	5557	4920	5189.3772	5260.2461	0.9537245	0.8903984	-0.0991	0.205704541814	0.93360134	15163	16952	14361.819	16872.178	2.5181065	2.8382174	0.1726	0.154437389814	1.12712365	33496	41310	31503.228	39501.467	6.2870605	7.2925206	0.2140	0.112429647941	1.15992536	20276	17107	19188.753	17018.136	3.7683627	3.0148914	-0.3218	-0.319912867831	0.80005347	4890	4335	4565.5024	4672.5267	1.2093615	1.0866549	-0.1544	-0.193771429701	0.8985368	5038	4765	4705.5465	5102.9194	0.7936606	0.8587766	0.1138	0.0887285986703	1.08204519	5705	4933	5325.6946	5273.431	1.2542608	1.0746301	-0.2230	-0.0832325986905	0.856783510	18981	14564	17958.388	14608.074	3.0531656	2.604716	-0.2292	-0.202992518946	0.853119811	36615	31142	34342.748	30209.948	5.5553243	5.4037068	-0.0399	0.00232504829988	0.972707712	8399	7926	7886.6754	8260.6968	1.3276468	1.6724963	0.3331	0.2811180291	1.259744913	13578	10341	12837.623	10614.493	1.740303	1.626544	-0.0975	0.0343639220984	0.934632614	11568	13718	10931.222	13809.743	3.1418552	3.3927679	0.1108	0.193330826264	1.079861315	9729	6410	9146.6359	6764.8489	1.3192525	1.2189665	-0.1141	0.142322984758	0.923982716	5653	4730	5277.8032	5067.3577	0.9413782	0.9984438	0.0849	0.190860840075	1.060619217	3293	2768	3058.0908	3037.8336	0.708672	0.6115748	-0.2126	0.0764473144288	0.86298718	7837	7396	7355.5798	7724.2928	1.4860622	1.4588511	-0.0267	-0.112335254684	0.981689119	4066	4329	3791.741	4666.2924	0.8082736	0.8840974	0.1294	0.199527871814	1.093809520	3855	2993	3586.8135	3273.0802	0.5726699	0.5320501	-0.1061	0.0915833984485	0.9290694!sample_table_end
