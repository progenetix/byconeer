Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481828/suppl/GSM481828_MR102.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5478	6446	5574.604	6324.7083	1.077687	1.1420356	-0.0837	-0.0105471806318	0.94365452	7550	6749	7588.6005	6626.9796	1.4763842	1.2207054	0.2744	-0.208382357067	1.20945173	4483	4704	4604.4838	4582.0951	0.9335216	0.9049174	0.0449	-0.122047278996	1.03160984	15100	13550	14629.154	13531.214	3.0582918	2.7778743	0.1387	-0.0739977416153	1.10094685	18012	15942	17277.101	16007.869	3.7391928	3.3337513	0.1656	-0.096171241599	1.12161726	11125	10885	10966.755	10814.291	2.402146	2.2578462	0.0894	0.0298822555706	1.06391047	3900	3781	4031.2171	3669.205	0.7748938	0.7469724	0.0529	0.0428425192796	1.03737948	4053	3912	4181.9321	3800.1795	0.8581236	0.800418	0.1004	-0.295199251561	1.07209439	9909	9397	9827.4428	9290.7011	1.7995247	1.6371823	0.1364	-0.0382049660339	1.099159610	16898	16609	16271.544	16729.339	3.418137	3.5898242	-0.0707	-0.0460602478023	0.952173911	18283	17111	17522.017	17266.51	3.5669285	3.6547953	-0.0351	-0.0268547525888	0.975958512	11506	11443	11325.381	11383.443	2.1446423	2.3035648	-0.1031	-0.154443439086	0.931010213	8376	8072	8379.2288	7976.8563	1.3744578	1.4508409	-0.0780	-0.183163731353	0.947352514	14598	13253	14171.018	13223.185	2.8509511	2.4110053	0.2418	-0.045822245583	1.18247415	5511	5901	5607.7807	5785.0845	1.0697062	1.1227425	-0.0698	0.0384821167844	0.952761816	7095	6966	7147.3261	6843.2397	1.2488711	1.2746853	-0.0295	-0.2028776721	0.979748617	2222	2423	2349.0022	2346.7004	0.4596866	0.4311516	0.0925	0.103202725717	1.066183218	7504	7721	7543.9927	7618.3305	1.4412262	1.3250747	0.1212	-0.183604271584	1.087656619	4403	5015	4526.3891	4889.1786	0.8883554	0.9112816	-0.0368	0.067117710784	0.974841820	3999	4047	4128.7672	3935.1386	0.8407474	0.8355654	0.0089	-0.225395761865	1.0062017!sample_table_end
