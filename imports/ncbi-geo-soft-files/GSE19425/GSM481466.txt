Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481466/suppl/GSM481466_DE361.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4856	4311	4940.2009	4195.0458	1.6604112	1.3995809	-0.2465	-0.0702893107539	0.84291222	1616	1647	1601.9048	1663.9146	0.7854619	0.8396655	0.0963	0.121394498039	1.06900853	5199	4521	5290.7243	4397.297	1.5761182	1.3266648	-0.2486	0.0121538613965	0.84172934	5821	7355	5927.6927	7099.5548	2.0924797	2.4885505	0.2501	0.298240577283	1.1892835	11539	13822	11652.66	13456.434	3.5990497	4.2963962	0.2555	0.263142844336	1.19375856	11603	10576	11715.919	10233.806	3.6864789	3.2008633	-0.2038	-0.225707674358	0.86827117	2194	2200	2199.9174	2191.602	1.3232909	1.1775676	-0.1683	-0.159615323392	0.88987818	2100	2177	2102.4506	2169.8826	0.8070189	0.815373	0.0149	-0.0249119551351	1.01035179	2890	2722	2921.6636	2685.2901	1.3340906	1.3609968	0.0288	-0.0346010665546	1.020168210	11336	10621	11451.944	10278.309	5.3867251	4.7346838	-0.1861	-0.179067327523	0.87895411	16198	15406	16212.204	15032.495	7.0396467	6.5885103	-0.0956	-0.0442056147131	0.935914912	1871	2447	1864.8773	2424.6171	1.0861265	1.3102572	0.2707	0.226919577679	1.206357913	2480	3034	2494.217	2980.236	1.8708771	1.9859481	0.0861	0.0203340712695	1.061506514	5316	6052	5410.9603	5856.6554	2.1969222	2.4660256	0.1667	0.12714538804	1.122491115	2632	2650	2649.3664	2617.2895	1.2607342	1.1847587	-0.0897	0.0298380242324	0.939737116	2437	2762	2451.0054	2722.9004	1.402499	1.4333501	0.0314	0.0400983266815	1.021997317	1629	1390	1615.1702	1419.8818	0.7142142	0.6377044	-0.1635	-0.0417001548246	0.892875618	7550	7207	7679.5245	6958.4999	2.1284723	1.9794553	-0.1047	-0.181880720755	0.929988719	3765	2911	3820.9844	2863.4367	1.6835151	1.4965946	-0.1698	-0.116528527975	0.888970120	1382	1189	1362.1931	1226.7533	0.7370246	0.6495463	-0.1823	0.0500003848412	0.8813088!sample_table_end
