Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481882/suppl/GSM481882_MR296.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	7733	5257	6947.9233	5763.4705	1.4287143	1.2564737	-0.1853	0.178314741751	0.87944362	7499	6689	6740.9498	7314.3922	1.5251463	1.7706012	0.2153	0.195508868754	1.16093863	6118	3881	5530.7104	4267.668	1.0533673	0.8573986	-0.2970	0.0647247809259	0.81395974	19020	12181	16844.156	13236.508	3.1054194	2.5675293	-0.2744	-0.0913701398025	0.82678995	20922	16040	18531.347	17372.401	3.7651509	3.5341346	-0.0914	-0.185045358644	0.93864366	12284	9525	10933.234	10373.821	2.2253181	2.2050568	-0.0132	-0.174196873096	0.99089517	2622	2890	2425.7446	3201.009	0.6418995	0.729753	0.1851	-0.0130662576281	1.13686488	5360	3971	4863.2484	4368.3937	0.8232257	0.7757505	-0.0857	-0.0335284378819	0.94233029	8676	6819	7794.0123	7458.0013	1.7547038	1.7462601	-0.0070	0.0189914568306	0.99518810	17136	16101	15203.124	17438.083	2.8434766	3.4198041	0.2663	0.0181632631555	1.202684111	26477	19454	23424.857	21023.453	4.2763961	4.1466459	-0.0445	-0.0991236883724	0.96965912	13280	8912	11792.616	9716.6741	2.5253162	2.0221312	-0.3206	-0.122887737849	0.800743813	9496	8387	8498.5376	9157.2404	1.765667	1.7966017	0.0251	-0.0109774304516	1.017520114	14217	10363	12612.345	11282.024	3.2187634	2.8574654	-0.1718	-0.371219369782	0.887752515	6650	5779	5990.0726	6332.5242	1.1536233	1.209186	0.0679	0.0234096574069	1.048163616	4811	4298	4374.3343	4727.0415	1.0108082	1.0162223	0.0077	-0.0864937388615	1.005356217	2530	2074	2342.7738	2313.7745	0.5250006	0.5520963	0.0726	0.106468929934	1.051610918	6408	6989	5778.2915	7645.7339	1.4598375	1.6569151	0.1827	0.00695689867363	1.134999719	5316	4147	4823.1526	4563.9961	1.0931151	1.0935873	0.0006	-0.0192870656576	1.00043220	6652	4478	5991.8609	4920.4294	0.9000188	0.7936628	-0.1814	0.0358731577517	0.8818292!sample_table_end
