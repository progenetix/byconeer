Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481720/suppl/GSM481720_JBH218.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4341	3725	4142.8954	3947.5876	1.0274988	0.9078668	-0.1786	-0.00433638458983	0.88356972	4759	4730	4557.1851	4949.0049	1.3849436	1.3752489	-0.0101	0.0855399584682	0.99299993	5145	4984	4923.6307	5198.7739	0.8785796	0.8722297	-0.0105	0.169284559192	0.99277254	18162	17426	17144.563	17738.506	3.1483678	3.1688958	0.0094	0.0074248788577	1.00652025	29292	22618	27114.676	23180.294	4.5417416	3.773777	-0.2672	-0.274880476904	0.83090966	13079	13008	12510.95	13203.968	2.4544279	2.4573535	0.0017	-0.0605668777373	1.00119197	5204	4785	4979.8497	5003.1511	0.8675984	0.886482	0.0311	0.0570616193146	1.02176538	4250	3866	4052.7457	4087.7545	0.6534369	0.6657297	0.0269	0.0749288661825	1.01881259	4189	4000	3992.799	4220.2537	1.1681489	1.1370012	-0.0390	-0.0207880604457	0.973335710	18672	15640	17608.858	15891.719	2.640607	2.4445035	-0.1113	-0.0186307268667	0.925735411	29624	25939	27403.832	26697.306	4.1443221	4.2519378	0.0370	0.022070898033	1.02596712	8391	10723	8078.339	10887.047	1.218058	1.6771103	0.4614	0.233473839282	1.376872213	8739	7255	8416.55	7431.7881	1.267991	1.15728	-0.1318	0.0673282562481	0.912687814	8109	8485	7802.7807	8653.4462	2.624793	2.6208038	-0.0022	-0.0303713751124	0.998480215	9365	8634	9017.1966	8802.0743	1.2819517	1.2639964	-0.0203	0.0653477217078	0.985993716	7971	7485	7667.7422	7660.9738	1.171894	1.187556	0.0192	0.0417036177149	1.013364617	1732	1586	1635.5197	1754.0609	0.4898531	0.4838884	-0.0177	0.231914045637	0.987823318	6932	6691	6663.3939	6875.6668	1.2819161	1.241647	-0.0460	-0.126831493785	0.968586719	3189	2837	3020.3451	3048.976	0.8593334	0.8019031	-0.0998	0.0298055211067	0.933168720	5431	4853	5206.961	5070.0502	0.80107	0.8067258	0.0102	0.0433653646547	1.0070603!sample_table_end
