Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481620/suppl/GSM481620_EL690.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1780	1449	1824.5019	1403.4494	1.3185953	1.0247187	-0.3638	-0.0364440368462	0.7771292	768	1003	777.0044	1001.4412	0.7136055	0.8865757	0.3131	0.11636209489	1.24238913	507	625	468.8963	665.3891	0.2897919	0.4193479	0.5331	0.437555770896	1.44706534	9265	7375	8688.0191	6923.6019	5.5296315	4.6566738	-0.2479	0.018610247705	0.84213095	5954	13372	5747.1635	12749.776	3.9674232	8.8809882	1.1625	0.271502410607	2.23847766	8155	9661	7714.531	9132.3154	5.2400369	6.2276242	0.2491	0.105303813567	1.18846957	1845	2012	1887.7868	1912.0269	1.5396454	1.3499736	-0.1897	-0.133681481703	0.87680818	1009	1040	1033.2668	1035.1847	0.6391823	0.6882547	0.1067	-0.0908785921377	1.07677389	4361	2924	4318.707	2745.3113	4.0240277	2.4208854	-0.7331	-0.387762845965	0.601607510	7963	10452	7545.0359	9902.0931	4.9495575	6.8119707	0.4608	0.299895687498	1.376278711	3924	2955	3904.1502	2774.0269	2.2769749	1.8501771	-0.2995	-0.428750494881	0.812559312	2392	3010	2426.1437	2824.964	1.7677767	2.006902	0.1830	0.204376513027	1.135268913	540	616	507.7097	657.1753	0.3616694	0.4504516	0.3167	0.254466214348	1.245478814	2133	3182	2171.0128	2984.6162	1.8694717	2.5481075	0.4468	0.303111825446	1.363009415	629	646	616.1462	684.1699	0.4211189	0.4655015	0.1446	0.310996281271	1.105392116	1106	983	1136.7361	983.1572	0.720006	0.6337345	-0.1841	-0.0843393682369	0.880179417	389	244	327.9973	315.7179	0.2922867	0.2741075	-0.0926	0.0267176375033	0.937803418	2337	3647	2372.2712	3420.0686	1.6229888	2.1994369	0.4385	0.355068376266	1.355176919	377	343	313.1532	405.2589	0.2819658	0.3646819	0.3711	0.29984377063	1.29335520	1396	1319	1437.4165	1280.6502	0.8992473	0.8188593	-0.1351	0.00694598689521	0.9106052!sample_table_end
