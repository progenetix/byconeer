Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481917/suppl/GSM481917_MR331.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6241	5475	5940.1199	5686.7058	1.3065016	1.2710739	0.0397	0.0681289846824	1.02787232	6035	5120	5748.3804	5308.6312	1.3500104	1.2568301	0.1032	0.0410534145112	1.07413923	5742	3399	5475.5837	3501.7909	1.0856496	0.7072493	0.6183	0.148819074695	1.53503094	15283	11256	14303.713	11677.491	2.9656854	2.4420891	0.2802	-0.023487035644	1.21440515	22056	18073	20843.521	18505.897	4.2895947	3.7607687	0.1898	-0.0715512344067	1.14061656	15897	11459	14881.241	11887.884	3.1249685	2.5435199	0.2970	0.106566348996	1.22867	4331	3735	4175.8266	3862.5534	1.0661544	0.9520364	0.1633	0.0578020909057	1.11986738	3969	3686	3842.0278	3810.3333	0.8407718	0.8626996	-0.0371	0.0232804794637	0.97458239	6108	6619	5816.4456	6888.8921	1.300507	1.5462669	-0.2497	-0.0732762115034	0.841062410	10810	9558	10124.441	9929.7346	2.8211035	2.9047703	-0.0422	-0.1103039141	0.971196811	16679	13996	15625.285	14453.604	4.1525411	4.0305942	0.0430	-0.0429130661174	1.030255312	10932	8773	10237.144	9117.9478	2.5108802	2.2003684	0.1904	-0.107160096659	1.141118113	6470	6067	6150.0325	6320.6202	1.8000473	1.8451993	-0.0357	-0.0337749652386	0.975530114	14165	13748	13259.3	14205.021	3.3185541	3.3261502	-0.0033	-0.118149318296	0.997716215	5077	4310	4863.1696	4460.1339	1.1069744	1.0354553	0.0964	0.0523488357933	1.069070216	4080	4463	3944.9833	4621.368	0.9404389	1.0743518	-0.1921	-0.0783927039657	0.875354717	2743	2068	2701.4208	2126.187	0.6421441	0.5204062	0.3033	0.190384769137	1.233928518	8455	6856	7960.4262	7134.0809	1.7677202	1.4893822	0.2472	0.125312802247	1.186881519	3891	3671	3770.0633	3794.3527	0.9465176	0.9831876	-0.0548	-0.036942808546	0.96270320	2932	2890	2876.7419	2972.3225	0.63731	0.707862	-0.1515	-0.154329085074	0.9003308!sample_table_end
