Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481715/suppl/GSM481715_JBH213.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3670	4571	3797.2378	4358.4025	1.1550101	1.1084904	0.0593	-0.0807885663033	1.04196672	3461	2752	3595.8657	2723.8718	1.1248742	0.7590204	0.5676	0.478707722386	1.48200783	7508	3664	7462.9248	3546.0876	1.8548472	0.9585131	0.9524	0.388474024551	1.93512974	7059	8528	7046.9329	7918.6908	1.7360381	2.1144601	-0.2845	-0.22640398971	0.82103145	10984	18227	10605.204	17782.968	2.4224577	4.1476142	-0.7758	-0.482067041192	0.58406056	10981	6985	10602.494	6531.6088	2.8250464	1.8563733	0.6058	0.613051711981	1.52180937	5631	2548	5676.9686	2549.261	0.9660984	0.4786171	1.0133	0.728721347166	2.01852038	4099	3409	4201.5961	3320.704	0.9964251	0.8765012	0.1850	0.329599420562	1.13682119	5031	5955	5108.6164	5597.3031	1.5410449	1.5275307	0.0127	0.0416720816309	1.00884710	23041	14023	20947.683	13318.624	4.2721161	3.1347694	0.4466	0.351366788655	1.362816711	23787	17534	21573.692	17032.733	4.9425371	4.1559715	0.2501	0.115717927652	1.189261512	5502	5142	5552.5847	4881.9242	1.1312714	1.0788746	0.0684	0.18558317852	1.048566113	9119	7315	8906.7562	6836.1363	1.8328868	1.5682038	0.2250	0.0590075766756	1.16878114	6996	8331	6988.6533	7740.457	2.5193536	2.4991217	0.0116	0.0226352683353	1.008095615	8395	5890	8259.8066	5541.7504	1.7596908	1.2970315	0.4401	0.142002431818	1.356706316	7870	6025	7792.0131	5657.0639	1.3950269	1.1068865	0.3338	0.108188541542	1.260316117	2563	1913	2712.7789	1988.0427	0.8180744	0.5545744	0.5609	0.0306202807234	1.475139118	5463	6276	5514.9516	5875.5476	1.4350407	1.5331075	-0.0954	-0.0309769616731	0.936033919	4272	4571	4364.4669	4358.4025	1.2942141	1.2131303	0.0933	-0.00583854057634	1.066838520	3387	2850	3525.4277	2814.6175	0.7564665	0.6288422	0.2666	0.0552567487924	1.2029512!sample_table_end
