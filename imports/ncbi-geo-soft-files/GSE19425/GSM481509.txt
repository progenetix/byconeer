Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481509/suppl/GSM481509_DE428.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2708	3043	3203.7851	2588.5517	0.6604007	0.5746092	0.2008	0.2331562221	1.14930412	4847	3767	5384.5886	3218.1622	1.2599504	0.7949933	0.6644	0.590524128327	1.58485653	4405	3770	4952.7868	3220.8027	1.0414333	0.743668	0.4858	0.499018228245	1.40040094	19511	12202	16522.283	12068.402	3.4578224	2.784951	0.3122	0.394632230684	1.24160975	18540	12409	15869.032	12301.279	3.9293648	3.0889906	0.3472	0.245681722582	1.27205466	14454	19008	13044.873	19934.031	2.8971371	5.0293514	-0.7957	-0.835111874528	0.57604587	3077	6691	3591.3933	6041.8454	1.3930033	1.8002264	-0.3700	-0.46476071065	0.77379338	3842	4322	4395.0833	3718.2283	0.9899808	0.9268789	0.0950	0.0260154447652	1.06807999	3008	3711	3517.3511	3168.8102	0.7758599	0.729372	0.0891	-0.0265991473923	1.063736810	10653	12469	10309.999	12369.356	2.1128261	2.6419573	-0.3224	-0.428284673376	0.7997211	14472	13829	13057.506	13900.266	2.6868232	3.0027401	-0.1604	-0.229208293301	0.894790412	11257	14747	10753.664	14962.426	3.4401307	3.6786712	-0.0967	0.161360929998	0.935155813	3123	5095	3640.0018	4468.973	1.0163899	0.9740736	0.0614	0.128138959697	1.043442514	11429	9234	10877.136	8726.6574	2.5127184	2.0942215	0.2628	0.193051319732	1.199834115	3068	3327	3581.7409	2837.2556	0.8200121	0.669344	0.2929	0.239555928902	1.225098116	1874	3369	2285.8141	2873.6558	0.7232428	0.7019444	0.0431	0.141524476975	1.03034217	1355	1374	1716.931	1183.8652	0.3846776	0.2844984	0.4352	0.144072742624	1.352125318	5022	7631	5552.7807	6991.0597	1.4459033	1.9281789	-0.4153	-0.515365347417	0.749880219	2379	2698	2846.1405	2292.7327	0.6327709	0.5572622	0.1833	0.0548558380201	1.135499420	2291	2776	2748.7052	2359.2408	0.4781512	0.4311988	0.1491	0.135417059084	1.1088881!sample_table_end
