Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481562/suppl/GSM481562_EL624.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1768	1547	1690.6276	1636.0532	0.6437648	0.5776961	-0.1562	0.120780836162	0.89737142	3060	3245	2961.5478	3326.7994	1.4747745	1.4451976	-0.0292	0.149179878488	0.97994483	3147	2939	3047.0342	3026.1893	0.9530495	0.9280684	-0.0383	0.171363644715	0.97378824	11548	12250	11354.245	12004.259	3.6098635	3.9671811	0.1362	0.00748817372451	1.09898365	11075	16402	10895.658	16122.669	3.6608152	5.3125676	0.5372	0.0291045472933	1.45119796	7359	6071	7252.7662	6049.9636	2.5735525	2.0661188	-0.3168	-0.221057694843	0.80282757	2600	3110	2504.4901	3194.6686	0.8350755	1.0621754	0.3470	0.0363988158846	1.27195128	2720	2251	2626.0827	2343.4866	0.8126932	0.7586263	-0.0993	-0.160346957324	0.93347199	3046	3647	2947.8237	3716.3104	1.3930316	1.5378845	0.1427	-0.00570532400555	1.103983910	12987	12337	12749.679	12088.871	4.2720106	4.1708677	-0.0346	-0.139355555563	0.976324211	11105	7039	10924.75	6972.862	3.570572	2.4083719	-0.5681	-0.450405048048	0.674505912	6939	6973	6839.3316	6910.1319	2.1040599	2.2501569	0.0968	0.108397594398	1.069435713	1894	1772	1812.6426	1861.2092	0.6083211	0.6327006	0.0567	0.0123199435945	1.040076714	5281	6188	5181.6279	6162.1441	2.4481628	2.4171892	-0.0184	0.0687735667859	0.987348215	3126	3189	3026.2759	3272.0315	0.8767381	0.9846234	0.1674	0.124598912714	1.123052916	2829	3007	2734.3097	3093.2357	0.8483017	0.9983257	0.2349	-0.0150572280886	1.176852117	591	607	563.76481	667.0219	0.2667627	0.2769279	0.0540	0.214879535395	1.038105918	4084	3495	3975.5791	3568.6413	1.4487154	1.2141785	-0.2548	-0.0863635847845	0.838106919	1583	1362	1514.0957	1447.8906	0.7320534	0.6343881	-0.2066	-0.0301184607031	0.866587220	2524	1883	2427.5393	1973.2818	0.8310501	0.7119784	-0.2231	-0.0261652572149	0.8567214!sample_table_end
