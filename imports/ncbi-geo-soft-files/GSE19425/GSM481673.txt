Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481673/suppl/GSM481673_JA925.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4576	4272	4467.7159	4280.3321	1.6066008	1.5234233	0.0767	-0.0956374808925	1.05459912	2267	2225	2199.5765	2274.7625	0.7703465	0.7959224	-0.0471	-0.109349091413	0.96786643	3612	3037	3512.4436	3075.7245	1.4367807	1.2465217	0.2049	-0.011362425374	1.15263194	4395	4077	4285.6053	4089.1036	1.8060643	1.7561777	0.0404	-0.14791623421	1.02840645	6790	6727	6675.0778	6633.6695	3.4455133	3.4451324	0.0002	-0.206858069015	1.00011056	7671	6324	7573.8007	6249.9026	3.0603902	2.5131212	0.2842	0.154876487918	1.21776477	1013	681	975.4262	728.8697	0.9237623	0.7092876	0.3812	0.260221535952	1.30238048	1577	1539	1531.4387	1589.009	0.7006094	0.7301654	-0.0596	0.0170563163316	0.95952169	4951	5489	4838.7062	5450.6069	1.5793228	1.8142116	-0.2000	-0.114133986922	0.870528510	3815	4829	3711.5254	4817.7371	2.2114208	2.9024622	-0.3923	-0.108738888304	0.76191211	15803	14138	15761.614	13770.408	8.7384795	7.8877953	0.1478	-0.0726558117341	1.107848212	1919	1763	1866.8721	1811.4329	1.4991827	1.4684691	0.0299	-0.0745525406496	1.020915413	1828	1982	1779.9612	2033.5348	1.8486078	2.1048565	-0.1873	-0.0503664777865	0.878258314	8606	9690	8521.1071	9469.039	2.6257879	2.8496183	-0.1180	-0.158643303091	0.921452515	1366	1321	1323.6003	1368.3268	1.4756328	1.5158793	-0.0388	-0.120488838177	0.973450116	1245	1356	1203.4337	1404.8769	0.9687932	1.1512225	-0.2489	-0.0832856495771	0.841534317	2808	2731	2725.6739	2772.8023	0.9328625	0.9586191	-0.0393	-0.0157600009374	0.973131618	3742	3991	3639.9358	4003.8303	1.4495256	1.5380644	-0.0855	0.113165189338	0.942434919	4481	5064	4372.4533	5044.6183	1.5720563	1.8138897	-0.2064	-0.145357436191	0.866676920	923	782	886.2104	831.7332	0.4752659	0.4481889	0.0846	-0.0138179189079	1.0604143!sample_table_end
