Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481825/suppl/GSM481825_MR095.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5221	4752	4968.6543	4998.9827	1.1179254	1.0668893	0.0674	-0.0478053118279	1.04783632	9815	8415	9204.7837	8818.0043	1.2816406	1.1794299	0.1199	0.0560196573561	1.08666113	5157	4231	4909.377	4436.9532	1.029606	0.8950208	0.2021	-0.0339179184193	1.15037114	13713	12412	12697.708	12954.558	2.664262	2.6764431	-0.0066	0.00980893277244	0.99544875	14121	15936	13061.479	16731.206	2.8691612	3.5423077	-0.3041	-0.398389296717	0.80996956	11190	9427	10469.732	9858.3821	2.3737483	2.1703923	0.1292	0.116736162926	1.09369547	3206	2648	3131.3608	2727.8621	0.6911904	0.618478	0.1604	0.156290206633	1.11756658	3274	3498	3192.5976	3645.668	0.6484556	0.7472969	-0.2047	-0.0294567940351	0.86773489	18090	15555	16592.313	16323.549	2.129675	1.9996267	0.0909	0.0325229372639	1.065036310	21392	17781	19494.947	18743.674	3.4187455	3.5664444	-0.0610	-0.0115397640519	0.958586511	22919	19770	20821.369	20965.65	3.9389607	4.0906083	-0.0545	-0.0132354484659	0.962927812	11229	10253	10504.777	10699.254	2.3635612	2.4522065	-0.0531	0.239096761209	0.963850813	10621	8623	9953.5891	9031.44	1.7343669	1.6967251	0.0317	-0.0347929161902	1.022184914	13094	13021	12148.217	13596.719	2.0146397	2.1505808	-0.0942	-0.0977161248555	0.936788615	7040	5725	6653.0628	6032.9209	1.309593	1.250558	0.0665	0.0594559304675	1.047206916	6078	5684	5757.5099	5988.6618	1.3233538	1.4018746	-0.0832	-0.00586546928686	0.943988717	2734	2410	2707.9234	2470.4303	0.4626267	0.4062141	0.1876	-0.0629924769165	1.138873918	6462	6923	6113.5078	7291.8194	1.3028651	1.4861372	-0.1899	-0.101914484028	0.876678819	6692	6244	6327.7853	6588.7533	1.1030008	1.1048631	-0.0024	-0.0155971348084	0.998314520	4401	4258	4220.5475	4465.4072	0.7196333	0.8096889	-0.1701	-0.126514978278	0.8887776!sample_table_end
