Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481537/suppl/GSM481537_EL157.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3773	2524	3173.5492	2986.3558	0.998976	0.9098483	0.1348	-0.0951207916796	1.09795882	3354	2720	2834.5132	3200.072	0.8579261	0.9829213	-0.1962	-0.18732819347	0.87283293	4748	2952	4030.5636	3445.2822	1.2891488	1.0500661	0.2959	0.025951115492	1.22768354	9833	14275	8643.5818	14461.132	2.8750028	4.7256924	-0.7170	-0.497796430298	0.6083775	11926	14072	10598.168	14271.285	3.471403	4.6461122	-0.4205	-0.222182526882	0.74716296	7109	6712	6144.8968	7297.1968	2.1247648	2.4750103	-0.2201	-0.259139066323	0.85848727	2192	2134	1869.7576	2551.6288	0.609754	0.8267147	-0.4392	-0.182782030961	0.73756278	2706	2579	2287.4594	3047.104	0.7535618	0.9704918	-0.3650	-0.26762405587	0.77647429	6450	5578	5540.609	6189.4193	1.5529541	1.7448886	-0.1681	-0.155518218741	0.890001810	10134	8452	8921.5908	8955.6975	3.0929244	3.0373931	0.0261	-0.00859858662978	1.018282511	7289	12692	6312.6022	12975.058	2.1456077	4.3972008	-1.0352	-1.00196522094	0.487948512	6009	3427	5143.8888	3963.1363	1.7325935	1.319881	0.3925	0.1084817691	1.312689113	3803	2754	3199.0925	3235.6635	1.05476	1.0708648	-0.0219	-0.00809338376765	0.984960914	8431	6015	7359.7407	6630.6779	2.2985865	2.1223961	0.1151	-0.128168145374	1.083014815	3838	2564	3228.8942	3030.5446	1.0704081	0.975594	0.1338	0.0180331871452	1.09718616	4205	3427	3548.5234	3963.1363	1.1143194	1.2609842	-0.1784	0.019337120865	0.883690217	2764	1803	2333.5823	2172.0286	0.7387206	0.6834819	0.1121	-0.0413792812104	1.080819518	4919	3031	4179.1293	3530.3229	1.3185781	1.1450037	0.2036	0.00261482201582	1.151592819	4806	2863	4080.9419	3350.2677	1.2356932	1.0251247	0.2695	0.0661660862074	1.205407720	4135	2098	3486.815	2511.3317	1.0764818	0.7643768	0.4940	0.0960521139504	1.408313!sample_table_end
