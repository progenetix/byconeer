Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481949/suppl/GSM481949_MR375.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6527	4750	6394.7353	4713.9457	1.4117037	1.063045	0.4092	0.252915889057	1.3279812	8455	6681	8145.0687	6757.6206	1.8506373	1.5952033	0.2143	0.0966037946871	1.16012623	3718	2761	3809.1198	2647.2348	0.8517536	0.5961281	0.5148	0.0970920073018	1.42880954	17698	14144	16552.249	14591.297	3.8696143	3.3301113	0.2166	-0.0553022306528	1.16200745	23621	19688	22084.624	20256.251	5.0665228	4.5665907	0.1499	-0.0915189156985	1.1094766	11784	10020	11164.726	10275.868	2.6564337	2.468284	0.1060	0.0110498802625	1.07622697	2702	2900	2843.9468	2788.8801	0.6664003	0.6375746	0.0638	0.00803560866928	1.04521148	3388	4213	3494.8115	4139.2819	0.7976686	0.9709079	-0.2835	-0.0999199865582	0.82156989	4076	5124	4141.0389	5106.1616	0.8797308	1.1098326	-0.3352	-0.11602256543	0.792669810	13914	9758	13103.238	9999.1812	3.4121083	2.6714683	0.3530	0.0872935098342	1.277240711	12011	17326	11370.944	17857.779	2.8909324	4.6267385	-0.6785	-0.403644341228	0.624831612	13388	12143	12627.378	12504.222	3.0226881	2.9354323	0.0423	-0.181254602647	1.02972513	4681	4903	4699.4473	4875.2477	1.1887143	1.2228485	-0.0408	-0.0363258953612	0.972086314	17330	15734	16213.688	16245.696	3.6984151	3.8219167	-0.0474	-0.140194618353	0.967685915	4652	4593	4671.894	4544.3302	1.0541802	1.0063491	0.0670	0.0376658831371	1.047529416	3314	4534	3424.2232	4480.243	0.7847583	0.9886316	-0.3332	-0.148954887672	0.793782217	765	659	846.8291	647.6192	0.1987402	0.16246	0.2908	0.184154969724	1.223317718	8440	8375	8131.6649	8535.6087	1.6838763	1.7644641	-0.0674	-0.0319970992344	0.954327319	2987	3025	3114.688	2917.611	0.7683962	0.7601063	0.0156	-0.00169958657786	1.010906120	2674	3117	2816.716	3010.9149	0.7257115	0.814622	-0.1667	-0.161959957528	0.8908567!sample_table_end
