Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481709/suppl/GSM481709_JBH205.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6298	7943	6306.9819	7824.5695	1.1294141	1.350522	-0.2579	-0.309588518808	0.83627962	5483	5204	5494.0796	5168.2043	1.197347	1.0572821	0.1795	0.0499291726184	1.13247633	6656	6474	6666.3877	6398.7494	1.1347339	1.0813739	0.0695	-0.136749213113	1.04934464	14714	12645	14704.055	12362.964	2.4927314	2.0814011	0.2602	0.122174132681	1.19762185	20363	20609	20424.354	19979.709	3.8770788	3.8092003	0.0255	-0.0174081311751	1.01781966	11790	9634	11784.431	9458.6236	2.1546056	1.6972679	0.3442	0.249871624068	1.26945527	2003	2035	2005.3211	2096.1141	0.6538868	0.6798877	-0.0563	-0.0544865020378	0.96175698	4986	4430	4993.6508	4417.6072	0.8535137	0.7628625	0.1620	0.142667251448	1.11883039	6889	7501	6906.8707	7399.8215	1.5051093	1.4910732	0.0135	0.021204807404	1.009413310	19560	18916	19608.033	18349.035	3.1787261	3.0339193	0.0673	0.0410581820521	1.047729211	26957	29905	27073.695	28854.175	4.4510633	4.7803446	-0.1030	-0.14357623635	0.931117612	5794	5868	5813.9278	5813.9056	1.3936981	1.5138276	-0.1193	-0.043761876889	0.920645113	7309	10646	7337.1539	10434.634	1.6349254	2.3766708	-0.5397	-0.307225239979	0.687905714	9123	11132	9134.6324	10907	2.4830761	2.7747223	-0.1602	-0.178028205421	0.894891715	6670	7172	6680.7585	7080.6763	1.291711	1.4534588	-0.1702	-0.208411127672	0.888715216	3777	4538	3798.6287	4520.5868	1.0284213	1.2846831	-0.3210	-0.209352072607	0.800525317	2667	3489	2677.501	3516.3684	0.5412255	0.6869509	-0.3440	-0.342378468723	0.787866418	7497	7933	7522.5906	7815.0462	1.4792118	1.5466841	-0.0644	-0.0792721195403	0.956376119	5600	6656	5614.8552	6577.2896	1.116318	1.2335287	-0.1440	-0.12241456124	0.904979320	4958	5066	4966.2003	5034.0598	0.7249587	0.7436188	-0.0367	-0.136494803628	0.9749063!sample_table_end
