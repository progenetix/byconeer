Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481471/suppl/GSM481471_DE368.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2645	1824	2197.7764	2126.4182	1.3170517	1.2926808	0.0269	0.144907812584	1.0188532	995	735	797.1799	926.2952	0.8259852	0.7869083	0.0699	-0.0427754308196	1.04965863	4016	2010	3340.5178	2332.8425	1.6589238	1.2837659	0.3699	0.210253940588	1.29223234	4564	2745	3792.3666	3156.2996	2.1781626	1.9059396	0.1926	-0.0450654569401	1.14282875	7139	4695	5876.0631	5308.8641	3.2855814	3.3102798	-0.0108	-0.0117878857395	0.99253886	8239	5790	6759.1031	6543.7418	3.320331	3.8098215	-0.1984	-0.111735307518	0.87151877	1271	978	1040.853	1192.1467	1.1227168	1.1630084	-0.0509	0.0707123180229	0.96535578	1427	960	1172.4554	1172.2659	0.768682	0.7431568	0.0487	-0.0126658315014	1.0343479	993	1040	795.3247	1260.4349	0.8445745	1.0947374	-0.3743	-0.0436616925945	0.771485910	12472	8039	10098.829	9127.8835	6.9198779	6.5137759	0.0873	0.129239620025	1.062345111	9486	8629	7756.7289	9813.7689	6.1229257	6.9693	-0.1868	-0.0470694379921	0.878556712	1360	1108	1116.9886	1334.5165	1.2033493	1.1907146	0.0152	-0.0582978888761	1.01061113	2289	2401	1900.0653	2768.8267	2.2269808	2.8248209	-0.3431	-0.0373093315513	0.788361714	2731	2496	2269.9646	2876.2508	1.7933781	2.2841918	-0.3490	-0.0843032254614	0.785125815	1647	1419	1362.8688	1676.7929	1.2554369	1.3083797	-0.0596	0.00362929145571	0.959535616	1868	1716	1546.9055	2005.5478	1.6616524	1.7770372	-0.0969	0.0694200608965	0.935068917	957	678	762.0372	862.9596	0.6542167	0.6429239	0.0251	0.0946187556066	1.017564718	6920	2932	5699.0572	3362.0783	2.3026958	1.9707378	0.2246	0.0703040002614	1.168443519	1770	1864	1468.0368	2170.9207	1.5546076	1.7752101	-0.1914	-0.00143405887813	0.875731620	561	295	396.8755	427.1711	0.4255387	0.4747286	-0.1578	-0.134705435504	0.8963831!sample_table_end
