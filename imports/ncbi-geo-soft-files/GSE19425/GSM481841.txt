Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481841/suppl/GSM481841_MR221.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4506	4775	4774.7596	4480.9608	1.044152	0.9838821	0.0858	0.0687783811502	1.06125722	7124	6957	7376.4855	6640.2586	1.8673394	1.6450636	0.1828	0.147738205229	1.13511683	5546	5996	5821.5067	5690.1941	1.2757969	1.2377663	0.0437	0.166146223231	1.03072514	19155	15654	18597.898	15487.359	4.0235267	3.4444813	0.2242	0.0344547827833	1.16810815	22235	19329	21405.621	19176.66	5.2069336	4.5238043	0.2029	0.0623205524347	1.15100776	10410	11069	10489.06	10799.862	2.4649364	2.5583941	-0.0537	-0.0606268804889	0.96347027	2954	3641	3178.7257	3398.577	0.8659159	0.9011057	-0.0575	0.0232498157478	0.96094828	3325	3629	3572.0838	3387.0937	0.7395743	0.7362693	0.0065	-0.0818042749434	1.00448889	4705	6024	4976.1942	5717.8935	1.1971851	1.3309438	-0.1528	0.146658610559	0.899500810	13565	14846	13425.708	14655.825	2.7387729	3.2010025	-0.2250	0.0226827034518	0.855598411	22927	22033	22035.815	21882.458	4.3779023	4.6552493	-0.0886	-0.00135942817977	0.940422712	13592	14095	13450.929	13886.381	3.1173188	3.2205418	-0.0470	0.0800202810992	0.967948513	6484	8114	6750.3229	7805.1027	1.5234868	1.8141025	-0.2519	0.105346729489	0.839801914	14669	14052	14439.345	13842.378	3.5836745	3.1766934	0.1739	0.179424294875	1.128114715	4350	4428	4617.5705	4146.8562	0.9650916	0.8921382	0.1134	0.179372952587	1.081773516	4081	5475	4344.6538	5170.6101	1.0377001	1.2206476	-0.2343	0.0511387456345	0.850122617	1493	2012	1637.665	1876.0046	0.404127	0.4573329	-0.1784	0.235682216136	0.883660518	5138	6660	5413.6805	6342.2124	1.2717962	1.4318455	-0.1710	-0.0602989570843	0.888221619	3037	3992	3266.3479	3733.3329	0.822019	0.9198811	-0.1623	0.0662509699458	0.893614320	2970	3318	3195.6224	3090.4818	0.6690122	0.6897178	-0.0440	-0.00595053196875	0.9699796!sample_table_end
