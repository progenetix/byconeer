Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481850/suppl/GSM481850_MR242.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6536	7107	7038.403	6494.4467	1.733913	1.5476892	-0.1639	-0.0834126372659	0.89259912	3720	6430	4050.4313	5870.4339	0.9847705	1.3847216	0.4917	0.381578305648	1.40613633	5633	5481	6084.9944	5020.4629	1.6594522	1.3684567	-0.2782	-0.0776726574542	0.82464364	6326	8802	6818.2379	8020.7797	2.0159252	2.3474485	0.2197	0.19640699162	1.16445225	10405	13856	11009.069	12874.22	2.9313324	3.3831502	0.2068	0.246415019463	1.15413396	7769	8172	8315.3295	7445.9979	2.4118735	2.1328592	-0.1774	-0.101977779737	0.88431637	3100	3513	3369.8819	3252.4782	0.7276016	0.7054019	-0.0447	-0.0409970284404	0.9694898	1911	2015	2079.4927	1884.4322	0.5733678	0.5186675	-0.1447	-0.208913272121	0.90459839	9006	9358	9576.7381	8537.6114	2.2452265	1.9240045	-0.2227	-0.195291791124	0.856931110	18137	18787	18727.629	17786.818	5.1776245	4.9383775	-0.0683	-0.0657558415348	0.953792111	24008	19521	24382.423	18531.629	6.5883222	5.0448245	-0.3851	-0.338756526555	0.765722112	7529	9764	8069.1225	8916.3087	1.7827957	1.973517	0.1466	0.0372881713875	1.106978813	11467	11318	12087.211	10402.561	2.788311	2.4150179	-0.2074	-0.206180358669	0.866122114	12060	14040	12688.423	13052.813	2.9855741	2.9786277	-0.0034	0.028351741475	0.997673315	8434	9899	8991.6838	9043.5494	2.0448306	2.0356256	-0.0065	-0.00598834243441	0.995498416	8150	8836	8702.3649	8052.3872	1.8475857	1.6954895	-0.1239	-0.164262655705	0.917678417	4042	3694	4395.0288	3415.9712	1.0462594	0.7916871	-0.4022	-0.233247946031	0.756683318	6427	6420	6924.8566	5861.1869	1.8149408	1.4789719	-0.2953	-0.352805627162	0.814887119	7369	7514	7904.1442	6859.3131	2.0444019	1.72033	-0.2490	-0.173925341565	0.841483320	2537	2289	2757.5363	2137.4379	0.8917958	0.6934931	-0.3628	-0.222353906702	0.7776367!sample_table_end
