Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481890/suppl/GSM481890_MR304.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	10512	9315	9861.4099	9852.4044	2.0439474	1.9643658	-0.0573	0.153783679281	0.96106482	6926	6035	6471.3795	6424.9023	1.569039	1.5201033	-0.0457	0.185052572313	0.96881173	4630	4079	4309.8939	4375.8239	0.8312069	0.8300848	-0.0019	0.0593965364432	0.998654	23679	21166	22225.552	22210.974	4.3099485	4.3019586	-0.0027	-0.0686537295815	0.99814625	27515	28318	25868.613	29523.027	5.3207392	5.9584083	0.1633	-0.140518681973	1.1198466	17162	13016	16102.417	13718.017	3.3382918	2.7308169	-0.2898	-0.180034545693	0.81802827	5146	4061	4790.7602	4356.9189	1.1298623	0.9559022	-0.2412	-0.167176628749	0.84603438	5790	4770	5406.1582	5099.5043	1.030111	0.9935546	-0.0521	0.0311468676074	0.96451229	8124	7802	7624.3777	8272.3408	1.5478561	1.6733013	0.1124	-0.0215646245767	1.081044510	16707	14958	15670.831	15762.922	3.6199997	3.8883243	0.1032	-0.0426197839577	1.074122811	18673	17827	17516.621	18744.925	3.7550916	4.3108091	0.1991	-0.0373135213469	1.147990412	14392	15707	13490.986	16530.637	2.8542984	3.486424	0.2886	-0.105844420296	1.221464413	5201	4998	4842.6856	5341.4322	1.2644156	1.4642886	0.2117	0.00782354711909	1.158075414	13506	15744	12664.317	16568.452	3.610121	4.3484662	0.2685	-0.0521604385027	1.204520915	4691	4173	4367.015	4474.5041	0.8413411	0.8999538	0.0972	0.0818159926985	1.069665916	3527	3564	3270.2004	3837.337	0.6903126	0.7957083	0.2050	0.047801776963	1.152678317	1545	1488	1419.6422	1642.7989	0.3757159	0.4169422	0.1502	0.0977125906759	1.109727118	7869	8572	7384.0307	9068.5868	1.6006984	1.7968021	0.1667	0.0723864211162	1.122511319	5454	4836	5082.4724	5169.5451	1.0388095	1.0487336	0.0137	0.0669861903413	1.009553320	3943	3301	3658.3734	3554.9082	0.7940675	0.8307209	0.0651	0.0346662054204	1.0461589!sample_table_end
