Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481781/suppl/GSM481781_JBH557.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1362	1074	1124.8264	1247.5938	1.1821212	1.2335469	-0.0614	-0.0256079593213	0.95831072	1127	597	855.4976	803.8982	1.07991	0.9319401	0.2126	0.226339342316	1.15877613	1119	768	846.1607	975.8398	0.6837734	0.7712252	-0.1736	-0.201820086165	0.88660674	6707	5670	6700.5195	5361.5044	4.9156539	3.9831538	0.3035	-0.044924386486	1.2341115	9274	13470	9263.4779	12351.945	7.7169937	10.139101	-0.3938	0.0972808266733	0.76111226	4002	4180	3946.2966	4028.377	3.6220724	3.5901902	0.0128	-0.107089394334	1.00888047	1690	1085	1487.5232	1257.3429	1.2444671	1.0981841	0.1804	0.180356419294	1.13320448	1724	1258	1525.1402	1412.247	0.9534149	0.9616571	-0.0124	-0.020051177425	0.99142929	1530	1185	1305.2831	1347.7464	1.6311536	1.4386534	0.1812	-0.00462168185845	1.133805810	7023	4868	7018.3282	4641.7834	4.6356072	3.4011913	0.4467	0.244305237438	1.362936311	5186	4412	5154.5646	4235.7452	3.2773455	2.973817	0.1402	-0.161346457139	1.10206712	4294	2867	4246.994	2845.2571	3.2825941	2.3849206	0.4609	0.113350449817	1.376395613	1582	1020	1364.4671	1200.5066	0.9983297	0.9522364	0.0682	0.0978819169184	1.048405314	2071	2747	1913.1788	2738.6445	2.6000806	3.2121634	-0.3050	-0.110241638008	0.809448415	1188	701	927.0937	909.9102	0.643995	0.6848299	-0.0887	-0.0183268072203	0.940372216	1298	633	1053.917	841.3829	0.784676	0.6791043	0.2085	0.172140177193	1.155457317	717	239	435.6111	430.2658	0.5562239	0.5261291	0.0802	-0.127430424953	1.057200418	1832	1626	1646.7682	1741.9201	1.70583	1.615999	0.0780	0.114692177768	1.055588519	903	434	608.7455	638.1877	0.7801107	0.7761879	0.0073	0.185137086511	1.005053920	1520	888	1294.3468	1086.0795	0.8883553	0.7591436	0.2268	0.0294952913866	1.1702072!sample_table_end
