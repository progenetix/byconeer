Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481876/suppl/GSM481876_MR288.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4119	3887	3893.505	4070.4861	1.6705586	1.6701194	-0.0004	0.0971177691147	0.99973712	3069	3098	2923.4948	3236.3239	1.3357278	1.4300723	0.0985	0.171803641451	1.07063153	3202	2494	3050.6048	2604.9023	1.0315923	0.8706676	-0.2447	-0.0879198764694	0.84400364	14210	10912	12833.069	11562.199	4.3010228	3.8939431	-0.1434	0.0393391637718	0.90535285	26179	24891	23097.939	26390.174	8.6528256	9.4698776	0.1302	0.123386502347	1.0944266	10797	11012	9865.0407	11671.456	3.6694536	4.1892778	0.1911	0.184037507618	1.14166267	2567	3035	2450.2949	3171.1954	1.0671394	1.2391198	0.2156	0.0758766463892	1.16116018	3126	3031	2977.9077	3167.0639	0.9857124	1.1065863	0.1669	0.109908779649	1.1226269	4110	4931	3885.3076	5164.179	1.6499008	2.1753322	0.3989	0.195807423454	1.318462410	10615	9924	9703.4597	10487.069	3.5513408	4.1254628	0.2162	0.1733175624	1.161663511	15689	7104	14116.282	7468.5851	4.7957474	2.7302631	-0.8127	-0.84200928706	0.569309212	10855	8250	9916.5237	8679.4478	4.0361041	3.3852141	-0.2537	-0.119886933727	0.838733113	3219	2986	3066.8672	3120.5333	1.3461289	1.3711216	0.0265	0.116329886704	1.018566314	14532	13376	13109.975	14211.349	6.881833	6.6360917	-0.0525	0.070202452431	0.964291315	2578	2375	2460.8225	2482.236	0.8561584	0.8825101	0.0437	0.132159864936	1.030778916	2141	2396	2049.4126	2503.8406	0.810989	0.9270493	0.1930	0.0610102428649	1.143109617	894	672	800.1168	775.9599	0.3732372	0.3534818	-0.0785	-0.000461721863264	0.947070118	4750	4321	4474.4188	4517.0961	1.6775402	1.5052007	-0.1564	-0.0885320119649	0.897266519	1638	1291	1561.2483	1379.3587	0.7168335	0.6452679	-0.1517	-0.0275008602162	0.900164320	3123	2689	2975.0408	2809.1256	0.9850868	1.0470702	0.0880	0.146785801615	1.0629217!sample_table_end
