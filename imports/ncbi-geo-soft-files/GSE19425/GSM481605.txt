Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481605/suppl/GSM481605_EL671.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2820	2563	3017.279	2368.9106	0.9065244	0.7868699	0.2042	-0.0521526154383	1.15206382	2197	2161	2367.6571	1993.5647	0.8335638	0.7505207	0.1514	0.0756604999649	1.11064733	2020	1835	2190.0841	1690.3947	0.9038371	0.6628036	0.4475	0.160656659349	1.36365754	11821	13310	11715.562	12645.201	4.3886185	4.6109104	-0.0713	-0.197123998677	0.951795	12367	23115	12221.717	22530.086	6.393722	10.578307	-0.7264	-0.182453229863	0.60441826	7275	10847	7413.9349	10224.333	3.3971221	4.489417	-0.4022	-0.294736454518	0.75669567	998	1740	1097.4707	1602.7773	0.9742676	1.2348055	-0.3419	-0.0133678623991	0.78900488	1889	2383	2055.7471	2202.4774	0.7947853	0.8456413	-0.0895	-0.0288321520622	0.9398619	3337	3423	3541.721	3161.6139	1.1957042	1.1299588	0.0816	-0.0127415879261	1.058183910	15092	14263	14715.839	13600.039	5.8892126	5.5168508	0.0942	-0.00367937640023	1.067495311	4343	7726	4539.3058	7245.9287	1.853186	2.9734025	-0.6821	-0.650006709241	0.623254312	5257	6026	5442.7427	5629.0418	3.6378871	3.2989673	0.1411	-0.0774411804133	1.102735113	1209	1532	1329.4785	1412.9037	0.7864941	0.7827179	0.0069	-0.104402431978	1.004824514	5608	7077	5786.8337	6633.3975	2.879461	3.1974443	-0.1511	-0.195242964095	0.900550815	1474	1558	1615.7209	1436.5539	0.7254938	0.5907251	0.2965	0.0782122190594	1.228141116	889	1395	979.5138	1291.0558	0.6709714	0.7812052	-0.2195	0.0330929632679	0.858892617	438	284	435.0068	324.9189	0.1550632	0.1222492	0.3430	0.793185156801	1.268418918	4719	4722	4913.3067	4387.2564	2.1623407	1.8981321	0.1880	-0.00868209795946	1.13919419	1588	1533	1735.1191	1413.8135	0.5918087	0.5435613	0.1227	-0.128181784142	1.088761620	3515	2665	3720.1046	2463.282	1.1208767	0.8142592	0.4611	0.0700547212415	1.37656!sample_table_end
