Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481862/suppl/GSM481862_MR266.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3180	4359	3217.0269	4307.5434	1.1140956	1.2406016	0.1552	0.113118370289	1.11355042	4866	5589	4890.8854	5516.8822	2.1349839	1.8519668	-0.2052	0.0113184398151	0.86743833	5068	4758	5089.5443	4698.1657	1.1205441	1.0384466	-0.1098	0.0345657800097	0.92673424	15249	16447	14952.812	16335.992	3.509241	3.8818024	0.1456	0.281254321285	1.10616585	22479	20543	21987.974	20409.283	4.3736696	4.2827467	-0.0303	0.0288227330673	0.97921136	8796	9306	8730.9445	9209.9117	2.2096796	2.3082042	0.0629	-0.0261004860935	1.04458777	3607	3675	3643.3046	3629.1699	0.7961402	0.8234709	0.0487	0.0101343120682	1.03432898	4368	4001	4399.7929	3954.6528	0.7361784	0.7166898	-0.0387	-0.0719572594818	0.97352729	2491	3774	2533.2536	3728.1703	0.9497592	1.097989	0.2092	0.0425846674282	1.156070810	14342	14604	14086.67	14510.257	4.4262698	4.8796022	0.1407	0.0695179517867	1.102418611	18479	17373	18077.485	17250.183	4.975621	5.1277493	0.0434	-0.0603060873506	1.030574712	16046	15496	15723.24	15395.777	2.9768555	3.1532091	0.0830	0.0368722507679	1.059241513	3581	3487	3617.2558	3448.1189	1.1875438	1.2155936	0.0337	-0.121445650082	1.0236214	7613	11397	7600.6018	11287.491	3.1333521	3.1987495	0.0298	0.0984137632567	1.020871415	5704	5951	5713.4728	5875.7213	1.0000646	1.128193	0.1739	0.180672891326	1.128120116	5409	5809	5425.056	5734.976	1.0369558	1.1623706	0.1647	-0.0193617814953	1.120945117	890	1317	934.4469	1315.5984	0.3944013	0.4289904	0.1213	-0.0122719767553	1.087718	5677	6552	5687.2862	6480.9093	1.4908142	1.5874989	0.0907	-0.109286483027	1.064853619	1983	2870	2029.0482	2839.4454	0.8518775	0.921414	0.1132	-0.0133636978875	1.081627320	2950	2828	2992.0801	2797.6709	0.8319889	0.7857717	-0.0825	0.0554441818357	0.9444497!sample_table_end
