Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481939/suppl/GSM481939_MR365.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5225	5352	5314.4413	5185.5827	1.650636	1.6515579	-0.0008	0.0478957029348	0.99944182	4039	4070	4216.7255	3825.9653	1.3834805	1.3127273	0.0757	0.0273304487685	1.05389793	3474	3368	3699.1892	3084.3898	1.1015719	0.9089025	0.2774	-0.0216316966469	1.21198024	15628	14318	14879.85	14383.586	4.3828578	4.1841794	0.0669	-0.130148361445	1.04748325	19127	19598	18296.909	19516.768	5.9372904	6.1133876	-0.0422	-0.187541846206	0.97119486	7932	6073	7773.9173	5940.5958	2.4843854	1.8782002	0.4035	0.159827688035	1.32274797	3838	3283	4034.3285	2996.0462	1.448522	1.0198454	0.5062	0.229253818638	1.4203358	1662	2477	1949.9456	2167.1053	0.5381208	0.614093	-0.1905	-0.0534111035453	0.87628559	3043	4094	3292.8674	3851.2319	1.0125551	1.2465692	-0.3000	-0.09839983357	0.812273510	14214	13075	13552.535	13138.712	4.2252794	4.2738303	-0.0165	-0.0974631188119	0.9886411	9905	8547	9559.5195	8534.6726	2.9719488	2.7190707	0.1283	-0.000266187363302	1.093001712	14056	11947	13401.16	12004.877	4.2366033	3.7526261	0.1750	-0.114880435414	1.128970213	4048	4942	4224.9008	4750.1746	1.2317114	1.4136315	-0.1987	-0.115275025857	0.871310114	8754	8856	8521.2371	8851.1663	3.0227501	3.2704744	-0.1136	-0.173319145728	0.924254315	4821	5022	4943.533	4835.1912	1.3609756	1.3444652	0.0176	0.0129749307075	1.012280316	2718	3778	2983.9986	3518.3844	1.0036009	1.133612	-0.1757	-0.0702331004124	0.885312617	610	866	809.4433	661.6367	0.2704196	0.2355668	0.1991	0.138287087794	1.147952818	6828	6811	6765.8683	6721.3644	2.0429997	1.9492265	0.0678	0.0356184204416	1.048107919	1588	2120	1874.3209	1810.1637	0.6463236	0.6688775	-0.0495	-0.0342668019584	0.96628120	2130	2855	2414.5253	2557.5526	0.7171401	0.7868271	-0.1338	-0.145488443149	0.9114329!sample_table_end
