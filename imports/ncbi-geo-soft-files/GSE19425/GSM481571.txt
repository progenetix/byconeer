Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481571/suppl/GSM481571_EL633.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3317	2839	3623.6468	2564.9157	0.761596	0.6283336	0.2775	0.00703213026824	1.21208852	5264	4784	5661.7648	4344.1317	1.3365815	1.1878546	0.1702	0.202615688695	1.12520633	2795	3505	3069.8343	3170.7115	0.6613541	0.7557537	-0.1925	-0.157373297136	0.8750924	19064	19311	18913.107	18420.974	5.2841202	5.0864716	0.0550	-0.0146114339019	1.03885775	17002	20951	17022.892	20105.268	4.0851373	5.5976172	-0.4544	0.0841482380842	0.72979936	13785	11631	14022.293	10797.277	3.1446016	2.8368543	0.1486	0.121665561666	1.10848197	1655	2845	1869.82	2570.2954	0.7540835	0.9775464	-0.3744	-0.105997599939	0.77140438	2483	2925	2746.1505	2642.746	0.869367	0.7875273	0.1426	0.0181542878601	1.10391979	5710	5322	6127.4873	4826.1202	1.3593172	1.2174854	0.1590	0.0141804448841	1.116495610	8984	11981	9412.5156	11134.21	4.0508383	4.1918051	-0.0494	-0.0131296745692	0.966370811	4926	9244	5312.8704	8507.0276	2.0574957	2.973548	-0.5313	-0.503921111067	0.691932912	6267	8331	6696.8525	7633.3483	2.7812838	2.9266906	-0.0735	-0.128254552699	0.950316913	1056	1357	1224.7999	1213.0996	0.6647236	0.586512	0.1806	-0.0887447320721	1.133350314	11346	9654	11697.899	8893.5745	2.5881306	2.4154373	0.0996	-0.0544033829913	1.071495615	1854	2386	2080.7831	2147.3297	0.81896	0.7511457	0.1247	-0.0481479938903	1.09028116	1553	2687	1760.1747	2427.5832	0.6880714	0.9173547	-0.4149	-0.181896677089	0.750060317	724	648	857.08834	595.58323	0.203704	0.1659144	0.2960	0.179219679256	1.227765818	6630	6030	7062.609	5481.6497	1.4475052	1.3545428	0.0958	-0.021670125369	1.068630119	1572	1766	1780.5962	1581.7456	0.5135653	0.4721495	0.1213	-0.110652127326	1.087717420	2005	2623	2238.6959	2367.8388	0.8715183	0.7976196	0.1278	-0.103921122864	1.0926489!sample_table_end
