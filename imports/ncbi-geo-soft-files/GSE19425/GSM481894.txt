Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481894/suppl/GSM481894_MR308.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	7242	4829	6654.4652	5202.1811	1.6398409	1.2841297	-0.3528	-0.026933227414	0.78308192	6029	4860	5525.5597	5233.4908	1.4237371	1.3970698	-0.0273	0.200920617185	0.98126953	5313	3358	4857.6768	3669.7194	1.1545262	0.8462711	-0.4481	-0.0997894813905	0.7330034	18896	16688	17282.82	17621.205	3.77239	3.827997	0.0211	-0.0467661597356	1.01474055	23597	21190	21523.426	22383.021	5.6211489	5.5029862	-0.0307	-0.171208219822	0.97897896	11259	12835	10365	13534.298	2.6829856	3.4189436	0.3497	0.044556811211	1.27430567	2961	3935	2688.6419	4269.7035	0.7663852	1.1046826	0.5275	0.103902041189	1.44141948	5215	4266	4767.1339	4623.6427	0.9797695	0.9716355	-0.0120	-0.0144067592995	0.99169819	6443	4995	5906.0809	5370.2653	1.3675964	1.3175613	-0.0538	-0.0501800298079	0.963413810	14889	12075	13665.761	12736.068	3.1426514	3.0982139	-0.0205	-0.0241173036613	0.985859911	20552	14717	18770.954	15527.156	4.0212921	3.5021995	-0.1994	-0.161029037569	0.87091412	13379	11205	12296.646	11825.817	3.0533475	2.8598	-0.0945	-0.177291565034	0.936611413	6014	4858	5511.6865	5231.4748	1.5276789	1.4587223	-0.0666	-0.102279742208	0.954861914	16078	12658	14739.702	13344.777	4.2482958	3.8851121	-0.1289	-0.17230715779	0.914510715	4688	3694	4270.3306	4016.9027	0.9284243	0.8666017	-0.0994	-0.0562208688774	0.933411216	3806	3289	3461.796	3597.6357	0.8654715	0.8454781	-0.0337	-0.133166256804	0.976898817	2450	1724	2234.8349	1948.609	0.5886857	0.5253688	-0.1642	0.0317418531584	0.892443718	6520	5619	5976.6859	6016.4885	1.7011155	1.6044648	-0.0844	-0.0609288429444	0.943183919	3530	2520	3217.8615	2796.5625	0.8249013	0.7480124	-0.1412	-0.0514670130953	0.906790120	4834	2924	4409.3449	3221.0792	0.915964	0.7316531	-0.3241	-0.0754413228581	0.7987793!sample_table_end
