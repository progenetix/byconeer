Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481765/suppl/GSM481765_JBH537.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1050	879	1069.3087	875.436	0.7386038	0.631968	0.2249	0.0358109553327	1.1687362	1635	1710	1660.5214	1670.0431	1.3703994	1.4208196	-0.0521	-0.13906195356	0.96451333	1010	944	1028.6629	936.4832	0.5792145	0.5681573	0.0278	-0.0830008391727	1.01946154	6962	6210	7039.3831	5830.8301	4.1905943	3.70947	0.1759	-0.160675547668	1.12970165	11619	12931	11511.95	11988.254	6.0692565	7.097547	-0.2258	-0.140785317839	0.85512036	6213	5250	6294.3634	4964.472	3.8909711	3.3537282	0.2144	0.153518843514	1.16019277	2175	2160	2209.3903	2098.0541	1.2582077	1.1997893	0.0686	-0.00176688253974	1.04869048	1591	1511	1617.16	1479.5621	0.95473	0.8973023	0.0895	-0.0162684797371	1.06400049	1334	1281	1359.3031	1259.5746	1.0553093	0.993339	0.0873	-0.127830906739	1.062385810	5334	6183	5421.3528	5806.3865	3.6689547	3.6526571	0.0064	0.0404825979661	1.004461811	4510	5505	4592.5465	5195.5721	2.7432763	3.1058749	-0.1791	-0.100457809103	0.883253912	4571	4161	4654.3414	3956.1768	2.6316097	2.2231797	0.2433	-0.0722189968264	1.183714313	945	1182	964.7147	1165.2966	0.644083	0.6726788	-0.0627	-0.0909112123381	0.957489614	3081	3207	3133.9928	3075.6541	2.8569035	2.836309	0.0104	-0.134871832705	1.00726115	1098	1089	1119.2401	1075.47	0.5777773	0.5640276	0.0347	-0.0631931589717	1.024377716	959	1315	978.5302	1292.0332	0.5227594	0.6962676	-0.4135	-0.084756612888	0.750802417	236	222	222.7911	241.9798	0.1861923	0.2061972	-0.1472	-0.0198277388606	0.902981618	2897	2251	2949.3661	2183.7543	1.6497865	1.3890146	0.2482	0.0617350067594	1.187738719	464	446	474.3362	462.8765	0.4013664	0.3917246	0.0351	0.0180896070959	1.024613720	1161	1087	1184.9129	1073.5267	0.8239091	0.6720233	0.2940	-0.0452419558301	1.2260125!sample_table_end
