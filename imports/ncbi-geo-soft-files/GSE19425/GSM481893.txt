Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481893/suppl/GSM481893_MR307.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4364	4647	4307.1573	4692.4924	1.2426189	1.379215	-0.1505	-0.026933227414	0.90096092	5740	4165	5598.3441	4189.4086	1.866265	1.3920764	0.4229	0.200920617185	1.3406343	3624	3268	3600.7901	3274.3571	0.9459628	0.8698296	0.1211	-0.0997894813905	1.08752644	18638	14147	17559.941	14477.429	4.3426489	3.6932318	0.2337	-0.0467661597356	1.17583975	18750	17823	17665.188	18208.169	5.1460496	5.1800482	-0.0095	-0.171208219822	0.99343666	11954	9795	11358.35	10032.584	3.2694339	2.8999836	0.1730	0.044556811211	1.12739737	3984	3497	3943.648	3508.2958	0.9553257	0.8002579	0.2555	0.103902041189	1.19377228	4011	4088	3969.5819	4107.7356	0.9188678	0.9934006	-0.1125	-0.0144067592995	0.92497199	4178	4776	4130.3267	4824.9192	1.2788243	1.4725749	-0.2035	-0.0501800298079	0.868427310	15962	12514	15048.704	12815.763	3.610279	3.298709	0.1302	-0.0241173036613	1.094452111	17287	17111	16298.505	17491.131	3.8856386	4.4425308	-0.1932	-0.161029037569	0.874645212	15187	13754	14334.876	14076.02	3.163038	3.0549012	0.0502	-0.177291565034	1.035397813	6220	6728	6049.2482	6824.7303	1.3435353	1.5144411	-0.1728	-0.102279742208	0.887149214	9396	10449	8992.2669	10701.723	3.7634988	4.0662214	-0.1116	-0.17230715779	0.925551815	4158	4318	4111.0864	4350.8152	0.8519875	0.9263871	-0.1208	-0.0562208688774	0.919688416	3424	4286	3412.51	4317.3192	0.7391694	0.9110388	-0.3016	-0.133166256804	0.811347817	1261	1246	1287.6099	1270.3079	0.4319671	0.4361875	-0.0140	0.0317418531584	0.990324318	4732	5401	4653.183	5468.8776	1.6063213	1.7520791	-0.1253	-0.0609288429444	0.916808719	2274	2387	2298.6121	2389.4115	0.7528998	0.797975	-0.0839	-0.0514670130953	0.943512920	3783	3471	3751.2667	3481.7643	0.8970121	0.8931018	0.0063	-0.0754413228581	1.0043782!sample_table_end
