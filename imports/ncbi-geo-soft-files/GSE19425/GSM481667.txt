Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481667/suppl/GSM481667_JA919.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1678	1352	1570.477	1447.1369	1.0228704	0.9802568	0.0614	-0.12812579506	1.04347192	1157	881	1071.9195	966.8948	0.8340475	0.748637	0.1559	0.0756952717464	1.11408793	1800	1527	1690.2021	1625.2305	0.9371093	0.9417777	-0.0072	-0.113631938328	0.9950434	3251	3516	3085.3842	3569.8565	1.7542479	2.1887385	-0.3192	-0.431239150954	0.80148825	5455	6364	5217.5736	6322.8086	2.8010769	3.5382121	-0.3370	-0.477135041515	0.79166456	6332	4757	6083.6714	4767.5567	3.5082412	2.9196682	0.2649	0.16580365639	1.2015897	3336	1827	3167.4868	1924.5217	1.3730066	0.8461814	0.6983	0.601724847216	1.62259148	1728	1413	1620.3401	1508.1935	0.947768	0.9346752	0.0201	-0.0310349944942	1.01400799	1864	1653	1750.9272	1753.1963	1.3027908	1.2941398	0.0096	-0.0373025213088	1.006684710	2589	3383	2441.7968	3441.1217	1.6857634	2.3654452	-0.4887	-0.195050480124	0.712662211	8482	7699	8211.1671	7620.8084	5.5832948	5.4876954	0.0249	-0.224757724547	1.017420712	2984	3168	2821.2406	3230.5667	1.2737666	1.5053176	-0.2410	-0.231968768908	0.84617813	2615	3296	2465.7616	3355.8798	1.4568481	1.8026624	-0.3073	-0.167799145115	0.808164714	3178	3583	3013.9314	3634.3998	2.425687	2.8356882	-0.2253	-0.232662536356	0.855413915	3393	3087	3222.5632	3151.433	1.6234946	1.6227398	0.0007	0.0266863386294	1.000465216	2364	2641	2230.236	2719.8522	0.8802868	1.1285665	-0.3584	-0.144073734844	0.780004417	1164	947	1078.6198	1033.6108	0.7866503	0.7744935	0.0225	-0.0881531177294	1.015696518	2289	2207	2157.1018	2293.555	1.3451746	1.4370881	-0.0954	0.0663136649549	0.936041919	1707	1667	1599.4768	1767.2248	1.2296982	1.3532153	-0.1381	-0.101880901889	0.908723320	686	606	632.3782	684.9132	0.4970669	0.5199986	-0.0651	-0.139719864625	0.9559004!sample_table_end
