Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481666/suppl/GSM481666_JA916.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2229	1818	2200.2972	1786.9278	1.2740225	1.0862484	-0.2300	-0.039943040305	0.85261332	1446	1063	1458.0273	1063.2689	0.9634921	0.7064154	-0.4478	-0.282127143629	0.73318243	1846	1710	1838.4741	1686.5671	1.2417248	1.1405985	-0.1226	0.0960267380395	0.91855984	5015	2385	4777.4469	2326.6703	2.9041493	1.4357263	-1.0163	-0.856015883038	0.49437075	6565	3217	6243.5104	3114.4385	4.5159245	2.1404614	-1.0771	-0.917579737883	0.47398086	4611	3930	4402.1936	3795.1199	3.1541192	2.7406505	-0.2027	-0.171879739598	0.86891157	1325	1845	1339.5602	1811.902	0.9483474	1.165274	0.2972	0.329713645548	1.22874178	1805	1296	1800.2774	1288.1306	1.0149841	0.7563607	-0.4243	-0.404224611374	0.74519479	1738	1795	1739.3429	1765.8392	1.1048487	1.1295868	0.0319	-0.0219096835767	1.022390510	4462	4679	4263.7667	4499.9319	2.4154512	2.6101497	0.1118	-0.0185713641277	1.080605411	13801	9969	13353.574	9576.4276	7.5847764	5.8555093	-0.3733	-0.170109826122	0.772008212	2861	2137	2783.2539	2092.2207	1.7337208	1.2294653	-0.4958	-0.466742047082	0.709148413	2147	2866	2121.6822	2775.1978	1.3999466	1.621219	0.2117	0.0192539868328	1.158057814	4926	3558	4695.2454	3448.0663	3.1846827	2.2878609	-0.4772	-0.444854294482	0.718395315	2766	2898	2697.6775	2805.3052	1.5106737	1.542006	0.0296	0.0898308543559	1.020740716	1389	1755	1402.8834	1729.1203	0.8577753	1.0009385	0.2227	0.0361914458028	1.166900717	1061	1030	1078.6244	1032.7516	0.6776278	0.6501136	-0.0598	0.0253024197877	0.959396318	1591	2052	1602.5687	2009.8788	1.3831992	1.6212326	0.2291	0.117065837257	1.172089119	1644	1766	1653.081	1739.2235	1.1057137	1.1949004	0.1119	0.0375225133207	1.080659920	880	787	906.5076	806.9365	0.5498015	0.5114754	-0.1042	0.0767805786769	0.9302912!sample_table_end
