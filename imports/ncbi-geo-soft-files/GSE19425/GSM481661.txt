Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481661/suppl/GSM481661_JA913.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2286	2167	2262.6453	2154.4312	1.1785753	1.1173063	0.0770	-0.195186474803	1.05483632	1313	1677	1306.6631	1697.0326	0.6785833	0.8839073	-0.3814	-0.42834992321	0.76770873	3143	2726	3106.5568	2677.0197	1.63825	1.4141893	0.2122	-0.00160528506931	1.15843764	2609	3841	2587.6101	3711.0334	1.4080008	2.1130824	-0.5857	-0.789370997318	0.66632555	4363	6966	4314.8166	6636.5613	2.3405735	3.4600527	-0.5639	-0.869405613799	0.6764566	4179	3982	4132.344	3841.3426	2.1975215	2.048639	0.1012	0.0125792568033	1.07267387	1611	1070	1603.064	1103.6869	0.968026	0.7100911	0.4470	0.473212212374	1.3632428	1305	1367	1298.75	1391.0683	0.6646461	0.7523439	-0.1788	-0.135291768026	0.88343389	2076	2328	2057.7674	2306.6373	0.9932238	1.1132827	-0.1646	-0.127715852792	0.892157810	4452	6170	4403.3357	5887.5173	2.0278775	2.7662895	-0.4480	-0.273118503088	0.733067711	15034	15304	15106.565	14657.279	7.4546117	7.5541179	-0.0191	-0.383564627307	0.986827612	2057	2581	2039.0033	2543.4802	1.2043901	1.5981282	-0.4081	-0.505660502414	0.753625513	3497	4214	3450.1089	4056.0671	1.860793	2.1854033	-0.2320	0.0886351231566	0.851464414	4511	6460	4462.0569	6161.8445	2.4095232	3.1275453	-0.3763	-0.493171724663	0.770419915	4240	3913	4192.834	3777.5456	2.2283697	2.0720318	0.1049	0.0411476406338	1.075451516	2385	2461	2361.5594	2431.681	1.3965952	1.5359656	-0.1372	-0.0674864014804	0.90926217	1734	1699	1723.1751	1718.2455	0.8686645	0.8828302	-0.0233	-0.141557830081	0.983954218	2743	3055	2718.0358	2974.6266	1.4146901	1.4627756	-0.0482	0.079663737314	0.967127219	2670	2858	2646.9987	2795.9545	1.336895	1.4341201	-0.1013	-0.131510785231	0.932205820	1082	972	1079.7483	1005.7995	0.4806384	0.4481322	0.1010	-0.102502987304	1.0725372!sample_table_end
