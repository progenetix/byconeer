Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481896/suppl/GSM481896_MR310.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	9641	7453	9419.5109	7494.828	1.8000859	1.398836	-0.3638	-0.0922055525248	0.7770942	6294	4858	6221.0438	4882.6971	1.2746742	0.967012	-0.3985	-0.0616335474372	0.75863463	7969	5131	7827.2488	5158.2676	1.372095	0.8960326	-0.6148	-0.0990008728909	0.65303984	21762	13883	20665.799	14043.8	3.6684111	2.4651197	-0.5735	-0.320829648419	0.67198565	29606	19794	27861.353	20097.351	5.5010881	3.8390482	-0.5190	-0.389694328412	0.69787076	13656	14600	13213.516	14762.267	2.4557026	2.6841145	0.1283	-0.133300386194	1.09301287	2804	2853	2810.9506	2879.3768	0.8218927	0.803077	-0.0334	-0.025793094296	0.97710698	6167	5063	6097.4606	5089.8647	1.0029111	0.8553527	-0.2296	-0.167328554997	0.85286999	6558	5784	6473.4658	5816.429	1.2199306	1.0593346	-0.2036	-0.171371342697	0.868356410	16210	12565	15559.233	12687.733	3.0820578	2.673355	-0.2052	-0.23384896413	0.867392811	24812	17949	23471.056	18188.592	4.7175582	3.8941067	-0.2767	-0.288907165707	0.825449612	16069	11228	15429.981	11319.648	3.6546073	2.6632382	-0.4565	-0.364658619849	0.728734413	7933	6489	7792.682	6520.0083	2.0739735	1.7510279	-0.2442	-0.202139904503	0.844286514	20727	15977	19711.96	16159.459	4.3919122	3.3207847	-0.4033	-0.308120933734	0.756113615	5737	5325	5680.3046	5353.5339	1.1686493	1.100889	-0.0862	-0.13410806851	0.942018216	4163	3818	4141.5563	3857.1827	1.0145386	0.91546	-0.1483	-0.279666157356	0.902341117	2581	2287	2598.4699	2320.6903	0.5518959	0.4880518	-0.1774	0.0115679149039	0.884318518	8781	7689	8603.7522	7730.7043	1.6297563	1.3513369	-0.2703	-0.076611715255	0.82916519	5409	4726	5357.6199	4748.9879	1.1077585	0.9760239	-0.1827	-0.10914471768	0.8810820	5519	4142	5466.1506	4177.0932	0.8063255	0.6748957	-0.2567	-0.157428212413	0.8370015!sample_table_end
