Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481616/suppl/GSM481616_EL686.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3392	2789	3195.0313	2942.2907	1.2120114	1.0473704	-0.2106	0.102360357938	0.86415892	1599	1831	1404.0512	2005.172	0.772131	0.9232294	0.2578	0.211896484554	1.19568993	3084	2424	2895.541	2591.2217	0.934769	0.8694922	-0.1044	0.0215547740281	0.93016794	20011	16176	18903.874	15933.163	6.4750558	5.7530186	-0.1706	0.116950366685	0.88848945	13222	18863	12622.935	18523.802	4.7733203	7.361917	0.6251	0.0525497232985	1.54230526	13435	13473	12826.132	13331.408	4.8264839	5.2544801	0.1226	0.197946139767	1.08867657	2277	2207	2094.0821	2376.9239	1.030995	1.1249486	0.1258	0.00553695642099	1.0911298	2785	2616	2600.5759	2775.8529	0.8149992	0.9480665	0.2182	0.161057095767	1.16327289	2261	2702	2078.0643	2858.6114	1.1213371	1.2788741	0.1897	0.199556767576	1.140490210	20427	20612	19287.312	20193.527	6.8374139	7.3618963	0.1066	0.2242438182	1.076707711	7425	2176	7103.6184	2346.1835	2.4670649	0.8895355	-1.4717	-1.38057643394	0.360564212	9466	7104	9025.9207	7158.3155	4.5890368	3.5240271	-0.3810	0.0182316445254	0.76792313	2642	2047	2454.802	2218.9135	1.1407667	1.0012259	-0.1882	-0.0414618314162	0.87767814	4230	4194	4032.6283	4313.681	2.4416435	2.2703274	-0.1050	-0.0502771870972	0.929835715	2489	1804	2301.524	1979.1054	0.8834178	0.7596947	-0.2177	0.109159671449	0.859949416	1879	1865	1691.7066	2038.7242	0.7616195	0.8950179	0.2328	0.116543485421	1.17515117	768	435	510.9625	636.427	0.2580704	0.277281	0.1036	0.255942991122	1.074439518	6032	5242	5767.4238	5344.1276	2.3404505	2.232503	-0.0681	0.151031009926	0.953877419	2845	1884	2661.1883	2057.4475	1.1967151	0.8232351	-0.5397	-0.14770072995	0.687912320	4221	2948	4023.8885	3095.8801	1.2281194	0.9896948	-0.3114	0.0856926381412	0.805862!sample_table_end
