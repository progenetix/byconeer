Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481805/suppl/GSM481805_MR047.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	8219	5425	8251.7444	5161.6433	2.1006843	1.3228979	0.6672	0.448562168689	1.58794142	5216	5032	5344.6729	4786.819	1.3994648	1.2534537	0.1590	0.140164676406	1.11648713	3909	3492	4045.1118	3366.1464	1.1026994	0.9497492	0.2154	-0.208669488747	1.16104274	10119	8760	10033.244	8283.0928	2.5600805	2.3982777	0.0942	0.0475025128818	1.06746625	12401	14408	12177.436	13710.366	3.4106324	3.8273276	-0.1663	-0.188662607857	0.89112636	7715	8675	7769.9371	8203.0897	2.1661001	2.3586629	-0.1229	-0.0980704541996	0.91835937	2027	1754	2079.4877	1786.6441	0.8956941	0.7369779	0.2814	0.088521424891	1.21536098	2696	3039	2792.9271	2949.3436	0.6704344	0.7508015	-0.1633	-0.0432831756492	0.89295839	9324	9672	9290.8074	9145.3712	2.4834507	2.3148755	0.1014	0.133477119266	1.072822610	10072	12971	9990.0785	12295.321	2.8758319	3.3929409	-0.2386	-0.0403137238105	0.847592711	8382	13427	8406.3463	12738.898	2.400133	3.5510786	-0.5651	-0.621332951375	0.675888412	5521	5357	5645.9072	5096.3539	1.7985017	1.7398348	0.0478	0.310493224316	1.033719813	3633	4074	3770.1352	3908.576	1.3176207	1.4583437	-0.1464	-0.107192045923	0.903504914	8719	9690	8724.2026	9162.7351	2.5929993	2.4487717	0.0826	0.0887193734899	1.058897915	4608	3490	4745.0448	3364.285	1.223554	0.9718864	0.3322	0.108676462828	1.258947516	2675	2568	2770.6744	2519.2104	1.0531618	0.9487422	0.1506	0.192001708925	1.110061117	4417	3174	4552.8324	3074.7274	1.1934836	0.8069097	0.5647	0.345967776124	1.479079418	4875	6120	5005.8381	5813.6506	1.3522146	1.4176839	-0.0682	0.123361072921	0.953819519	3340	3971	3465.3369	3813.8634	0.9976947	1.0582716	-0.0850	-0.030546630568	0.942758720	3993	3546	4126.3306	3417.3267	1.0803972	0.9108733	0.2462	0.135367278883	1.1861114!sample_table_end
