Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481755/suppl/GSM481755_JBH525.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1910	2106	2032.1903	1967.285	1.2108849	1.1054591	0.1314	0.0667126445088	1.09536832	1353	1694	1443.7431	1585.2802	0.9813252	0.9274288	0.0815	0.165054586748	1.05811383	1441	1352	1538.7322	1271.3005	0.821026	0.6927778	0.2450	0.12124117336	1.18512174	11147	8954	11193.661	8412.2087	5.4324818	4.4020781	0.3034	0.0356063157815	1.23407215	11813	12729	11823.471	12054.53	7.1658275	7.4233116	-0.0509	0.0195537593103	0.96531416	5311	7129	5482.7058	6660.916	3.4255107	4.160874	-0.2806	-0.287532881554	0.82326717	1858	2278	1977.3113	2128.167	1.3145436	1.406744	-0.0978	-0.0943581567313	0.93445828	2320	1986	2454.8687	1857.412	1.0511705	0.9040916	0.2175	0.0050056810613	1.16268149	2431	3301	2565.4405	3075.7304	1.6622427	1.685298	-0.0199	-0.00944280478698	0.986319710	8736	8717	8861.4705	8184.4763	3.7200838	3.982853	-0.0985	-0.0394008856709	0.934024811	10280	9411	10355.159	8850.3814	4.2484151	4.257292	-0.0030	0.0659827974653	0.997914912	7057	4597	7211.2603	4283.3376	3.8925921	2.5811975	0.5927	0.360792498149	1.508056613	1428	1670	1524.9279	1563.4781	0.7951033	0.9036073	-0.1846	-0.394548867048	0.879921314	3809	5091	3972.3502	4746.0902	3.7852404	3.4411957	0.1375	0.0200156798336	1.099978215	1696	1562	1805.7213	1464.1946	0.8334078	0.7938663	0.0701	0.111189599411	1.049808716	1407	1641	1502.6275	1537.1211	0.9006072	0.9261765	-0.0404	0.168889095182	0.972392517	582	833	627.4406	797.2243	0.4134238	0.4724276	-0.1925	0.00440790616293	0.875105118	2418	3190	2552.4697	2970.3588	1.8831391	1.8688909	0.0110	0.00175584510358	1.007623919	886	1199	950.9209	1132.9822	0.6022271	0.6513987	-0.1132	0.0529533613947	0.924513920	2118	1845	2248.25	1725.8468	0.9521278	0.7691742	0.3078	0.0231862148518	1.2378572!sample_table_end
