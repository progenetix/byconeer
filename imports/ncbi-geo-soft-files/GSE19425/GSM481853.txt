Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481853/suppl/GSM481853_MR247.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	9186	10060	8905.1	10115.032	1.6979862	2.0331395	-0.2599	-0.313379248384	0.83515472	7280	6585	7129.6395	6606.3833	1.3600139	1.3355828	0.0262	-0.140157478124	1.01829243	3741	3832	3735.4412	3851.3347	0.9522605	0.9548767	-0.0040	-0.213873974808	0.99726024	13161	12881	12526.446	12991.092	3.1606308	3.3248229	-0.0731	-0.188970329028	0.95061625	14503	13316	13723.801	13432.047	3.837983	3.7081059	0.0497	-0.0455460900934	1.03502516	7679	7297	7509.6525	7329.7965	2.0274577	1.9112506	0.0852	0.0518755822973	1.06080167	2201	2318	2215.9128	2358.7594	0.5033603	0.5568564	-0.1457	0.102790067266	0.9039328	2576	2988	2591.3687	3016.9193	0.7721758	0.9082523	-0.2342	-0.106606054178	0.85017769	6351	7017	6242.9567	7044.7894	1.1272471	1.3352556	-0.2443	-0.193266807354	0.844218210	10338	10492	9963.9508	10561.643	2.9543121	2.9711359	-0.0082	0.0137408025883	0.994337511	14082	15272	13339.471	15385.092	3.7579626	4.2301635	-0.1708	-0.163701293961	0.888372912	14728	15558	13929.036	15666.288	3.2094825	3.6613935	-0.1901	-0.289979412924	0.87657413	7068	8131	6924.566	8163.1566	1.669945	2.0370485	-0.2867	-0.179015110278	0.819786514	15436	16465	14552.261	16575.675	3.064496	3.5932742	-0.2296	-0.103631248747	0.852842215	5587	5855	5521.0981	5866.382	1.2647332	1.3878362	-0.1340	-0.0847675523638	0.911298616	4160	5575	4143.0614	5583.5852	0.9096502	1.2837108	-0.4969	-0.285546951427	0.708609917	1374	1221	1383.8794	1281.0051	0.2661732	0.265037	0.0062	-0.077406290811	1.004286718	7904	8651	7718.7552	8681.1283	1.4644018	1.5854983	-0.1146	-0.0752119514105	0.923622419	4179	4617	4161.7646	4618.1342	0.7929282	0.9552315	-0.2687	-0.246179674587	0.8300920	3003	3780	3014.2304	3800.4875	0.7363916	0.9654058	-0.3907	-0.434411714294	0.7627793!sample_table_end
