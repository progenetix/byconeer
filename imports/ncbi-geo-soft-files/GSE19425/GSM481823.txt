Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481823/suppl/GSM481823_MR091.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2983	3812	3006.3356	3783.1445	0.978437	1.2537502	-0.3577	-0.335005362201	0.78040822	3887	3773	3866.0544	3742.6977	1.3068855	1.2796007	0.0304	-0.0907192354686	1.02132293	2640	2700	2668.6245	2667.7072	0.8664692	0.8758159	-0.0155	-0.0797750664769	0.9893284	12506	10181	11128.976	10696.224	3.7747277	3.7429062	0.0122	-0.0348878603101	1.00850185	20746	13409	17230.699	14378.964	5.9037506	5.0082952	0.2373	0.0042888105156	1.17879446	9489	7933	8719.2203	8163.2889	3.0802864	2.9730568	0.0511	0.0454179470546	1.03606717	2337	2129	2370.7333	2108.3828	0.9467722	0.7618617	0.3135	0.167349191892	1.24270878	2792	3139	2819.007	3094.4573	0.9539236	1.1011202	-0.2070	-0.0659465636596	0.8663219	4463	4385	4404.2638	4364.6959	1.4180743	1.4146394	0.0035	-0.211776426674	1.00242810	11583	10715	10395.292	11301.72	4.085156	4.7265162	-0.2104	-0.175974842325	0.864305911	6474	11319	6198.6461	11985.659	2.2505403	4.5472007	-1.0147	-0.810225250927	0.494928712	5259	6350	5132.8092	6443.8635	2.1959518	2.6821193	-0.2885	-0.14495365536	0.818737513	2424	3307	2456.9872	3263.2033	1.2948688	1.6498583	-0.3495	-0.219921775592	0.784836314	12134	11172	10832.86	11819.942	3.5454307	3.9116168	-0.1418	-0.109491110313	0.906384915	1442	1835	1466.8116	1824.401	0.6010196	0.7490577	-0.3177	-0.216785059739	0.802367616	2712	3369	2739.756	3326.2348	1.0107532	1.2207878	-0.2724	-0.0846219646806	0.827951617	1016	838	1014.9886	892.1888	0.3461109	0.3171968	0.1259	-0.0370760102354	1.091154918	3536	4982	3539.0874	4974.5762	1.217591	1.6981411	-0.4799	-0.544816530908	0.71701419	1571	1837	1602.2287	1826.3124	0.581819	0.6812313	-0.2276	-0.182712534558	0.854069720	3152	3675	3168.1937	3641.1163	1.0836918	1.3238811	-0.2888	-0.280270993138	0.8185718!sample_table_end
