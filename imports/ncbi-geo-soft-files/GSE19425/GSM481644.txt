Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481644/suppl/GSM481644_JA798.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	716	1584	893.4486	1360.0013	0.8931205	0.8635063	-0.0486	-0.0554001682778	0.96684182	729	1962	906.3995	1650.5582	1.2297078	1.2022657	-0.0326	0.087909226895	0.9776843	1108	1839	1265.3989	1547.2943	0.783556	0.8759431	0.1608	0.0404977478582	1.11790744	7450	7243	7208.943	5719.8951	4.0061663	3.3226015	-0.2699	-0.0558819328809	0.82937185	13473	11598	12421.665	9238.3783	6.4318662	5.2083112	-0.3044	-0.0988367231786	0.80976676	4386	8217	4418.7827	6510.2285	2.9957015	3.8500806	0.3620	0.307775080119	1.28520167	2469	1981	2606.9352	1666.9252	1.0995911	1.0240831	-0.1026	0.305808066419	0.93133088	1721	2033	1860.9927	1711.4472	0.9880771	1.0046071	0.0239	0.284120832715	1.01672949	924	1968	1077.4884	1655.7253	1.4335669	1.1599114	-0.3056	-0.00317395544287	0.809108710	3146	4139	3261.9587	3296.1318	1.5394775	2.1241384	0.4644	-0.00202792061929	1.379778811	8513	7683	8159.3895	6072.2062	3.7330961	3.8078614	0.0286	-0.0772198010155	1.020027712	3630	3497	3725.2667	2814.537	2.0660379	2.2839966	0.1447	0.0209935354425	1.105495913	1087	1360	1245.9174	1198.0676	0.9702137	1.2968732	0.4187	-0.110001809061	1.336688214	1601	6162	1741.6477	4874.4527	2.7269451	3.605917	0.4031	0.299236098913	1.322328415	2049	2641	2200.6371	2157.8332	1.2170144	1.6194557	0.4122	0.0127075373908	1.330679116	1369	1403	1511.7634	1230.9992	0.7015823	0.8762767	0.3208	-0.0491591088013	1.249000617	475	1015	614.2474	934.8275	0.7997472	0.6721731	-0.2507	-0.130692472123	0.840481918	1173	3682	1324.8165	2951.7396	1.1271059	1.6335142	0.5354	0.138911169471	1.449299619	444	1178	567.0508	1063.5169	0.7488801	0.7930408	0.0827	-0.215248070718	1.058968920	9415	2775	8950.7879	2258.365	4.8690845	1.4380282	-1.7596	-0.813706505504	0.2953385!sample_table_end
