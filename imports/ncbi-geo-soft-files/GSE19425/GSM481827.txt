Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481827/suppl/GSM481827_MR101.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5060	5704	5225.7155	5477.0983	1.1396225	1.1544631	-0.0187	-0.0105471806318	0.98714492	5167	6099	5334.9565	5857.6162	1.2462558	1.3414233	-0.1062	-0.208382357067	0.92905483	4575	5266	4717.935	5068.3968	1.0147019	1.0422814	-0.0387	-0.122047278996	0.97353924	13063	14372	13035.596	13834.248	2.9748281	3.0777542	-0.0491	-0.0739977416153	0.9665585	17105	17061	16757.267	16489.274	3.6910162	3.5650962	0.0501	-0.096171241599	1.03532026	9211	9953	9362.4796	9511.2323	2.1255988	2.1196461	0.0040	0.0298822555706	1.00280837	2995	2485	3090.694	2457.9938	0.6894951	0.6143389	0.1665	0.0428425192796	1.12233678	3128	3863	3226.0625	3753.0953	0.7751834	0.8763101	-0.1769	-0.295199251561	0.88459949	5710	5941	5886.0071	5705.4143	1.3279158	1.2405163	0.0982	-0.0382049660339	1.070454110	10086	10980	10222.276	10522.594	2.5715228	2.6947397	-0.0675	-0.0460602478023	0.95427511	14094	14419	14005.948	13881.032	3.4890484	3.479061	0.0041	-0.0268547525888	1.002870712	9559	13200	9707.2916	12695.54	2.317989	3.1422654	-0.4389	-0.154443439086	0.737680813	6407	5581	6599.016	5362.0874	1.3706042	1.34322	0.0291	-0.183163731353	1.02038714	11763	12527	11830.882	12046.06	2.6109717	2.6193384	-0.0046	-0.045822245583	0.996805815	4710	4703	4860.1652	4542.1682	1.113353	1.0638194	0.0657	0.0384821167844	1.04656216	3821	5037	3941.0763	4855.7732	0.9005038	1.1954177	-0.4087	-0.2028776721	0.753296317	2174	1979	2244.5588	1972.1832	0.5191489	0.4519663	0.1999	0.103202725717	1.14864518	6241	8436	6432.0077	8089.4174	1.2800537	1.6031206	-0.3247	-0.183604271584	0.798476219	3776	3964	3894.8493	3846.6986	0.9652701	0.9206413	0.0683	0.067117710784	1.048475720	3182	4097	3281.5972	3969.8734	0.7840837	0.9384573	-0.2593	-0.225395761865	0.8355027!sample_table_end
