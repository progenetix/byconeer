Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481653/suppl/GSM481653_JA809.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1761	1721	1741.901	1704.4172	1.1204577	1.3039243	-0.2188	-0.341944156156	0.85929662	1436	1262	1422.56	1273.115	0.9690463	0.9576923	0.0170	-0.166871415187	1.01185553	1558	1281	1547.5378	1291.7819	1.1053258	1.0457627	0.0799	-0.190745812891	1.05695664	2545	2817	2493.0874	2710.1581	1.9120013	2.3561137	-0.3013	-0.517102702265	0.81150635	4731	6240	4564.1528	5830.2796	3.3005443	4.5923627	-0.4765	-0.50310519818	0.71870286	4444	3573	4292.5549	3404.3154	3.0130319	2.7335334	0.1404	-0.0395631251402	1.1022487	1502	1592	1490.7313	1589.0954	0.9682956	0.8838265	0.1317	0.0312760490255	1.0955728	884	912	882.7003	939.3854	0.6617078	0.7158933	-0.1136	-0.212249659363	0.92431079	1694	1796	1678.5377	1772.3752	1.0840652	1.2753202	-0.2344	-0.11908059101	0.850033710	2312	4738	2264.8268	4458.9048	1.939567	2.9716378	-0.6155	-0.386554345585	0.652692911	6478	9078	6231.2031	8437.6302	5.2311559	5.9447548	-0.1845	-0.313453235602	0.879961612	2539	4748	2487.2549	4467.8139	1.8710776	2.3749113	-0.3440	-0.424329751059	0.787851513	1385	3158	1370.3719	3021.4427	1.2604501	1.6742051	-0.4095	-0.236700445906	0.752864814	3011	4532	2933.9785	4274.8902	1.9834608	2.5233039	-0.3473	-0.32669326074	0.78605715	1934	2944	1902.7862	2826.5837	1.3295686	1.4947929	-0.1690	-0.167286740473	0.889466716	1014	1913	1012.8932	1880.4656	0.6714925	0.9473288	-0.4965	-0.332490476917	0.708827317	1047	1025	1045.6445	1044.9642	0.6825583	0.7934963	-0.2173	-0.213638469429	0.86019118	2573	3720	2520.305	3538.1763	1.2303468	1.6159515	-0.3933	-0.386448583238	0.76137619	1622	1671	1609.9361	1659.2503	1.1273098	1.3807282	-0.2925	-0.215877022623	0.816460320	685	664	688.7141	698.9956	0.5210044	0.5471742	-0.0707	-0.268293919681	0.9521727!sample_table_end
