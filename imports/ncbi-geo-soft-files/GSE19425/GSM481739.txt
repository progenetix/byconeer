Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481739/suppl/GSM481739_JBH491.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6187	6133	6406.6323	5825.0331	1.6936126	1.498266	0.1768	0.113951148987	1.13038182	5316	5549	5533.4486	5262.8904	1.4571088	1.3622778	0.0971	0.119029284082	1.06961213	4379	4372	4592.6429	4147.6828	1.1856397	1.0792212	0.1357	0.0709200046536	1.09860674	7106	6846	7345.1771	6506.281	2.0559002	1.8836031	0.1263	-0.00301478812092	1.09147215	14576	13672	14653.98	13100.489	3.6192497	3.2825554	0.1409	0.0182161165404	1.10257086	7973	8355	8208.0745	7948.5086	2.1389987	2.0899491	0.0335	0.0322029922362	1.02346937	4159	3488	4369.2103	3304.2613	0.9977665	0.8969983	0.1536	0.0465435843733	1.11233948	2456	2733	2621.0774	2583.0636	0.7521903	0.7497001	0.0048	0.0685895084678	1.00332169	8031	8382	8264.9678	7974.7189	2.1633646	2.0399948	0.0847	0.146967967631	1.060475610	8075	9694	8308.1083	9243.666	2.7675047	2.9278035	-0.0812	0.0577207283235	0.945249511	13813	16023	13925.131	15421.625	4.0480408	4.5412714	-0.1659	-0.185873042503	0.891389312	6840	6323	7071.2424	6007.2922	1.7223169	1.6907643	0.0267	-0.0425427840524	1.018661713	5837	6464	6057.8155	6140.6613	2.032218	2.1373756	-0.0728	0.0404764257423	0.950800614	8917	9914	9138.5185	9456.9911	2.6242466	2.5725687	0.0287	0.0462344185555	1.020088115	4623	5135	4834.9238	4866.0367	1.2497733	1.2919706	-0.0479	0.0805984536529	0.967338816	5009	5092	5219.3155	4824.9238	1.1883882	1.2842884	-0.1120	0.059709400554	0.925328217	2534	2744	2701.8923	2593.6483	0.712978	0.6711879	0.0871	0.0842052609231	1.062262918	5233	6392	5448.2059	6072.5537	1.3616019	1.4905401	-0.1305	-0.016447954738	0.913495719	4883	5451	5092.9868	5168.6282	1.4552643	1.4308766	0.0244	0.140388781019	1.017043920	1749	1955	1888.6926	1842.2256	0.634167	0.5705164	0.1526	0.065721191694	1.1115667!sample_table_end
