Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481532/suppl/GSM481532_DE495.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3287	3643	3246.5839	3695.6279	0.7776661	0.8610018	0.1469	0.132504327738	1.10716132	7881	9554	7632.1618	9849.5297	2.0811797	2.5919255	0.3166	0.329482775464	1.24541163	5086	5460	4981.6309	5560.7297	1.0970114	1.2027512	0.1328	0.00959082595719	1.09638884	20329	18569	18837.665	19169.164	4.6140022	4.6647364	0.0158	0.153657103706	1.01099575	27279	26421	24757.204	26917.835	5.2139085	5.5202173	0.0824	0.223723785337	1.05874846	13584	12275	12883.137	12670.781	3.1081034	2.9829628	-0.0593	0.0513365995003	0.95973737	5849	5356	5715.8653	5453.2586	1.1534947	1.1101632	-0.0552	0.121610796066	0.96243458	3715	3684	3665.6445	3736.9662	0.862865	0.9090382	0.0752	0.0210826829033	1.05351149	2853	3192	2816.9484	3240.6787	0.7754734	0.8482527	0.1294	0.314891501053	1.093851310	12485	13897	11877.957	14362.189	3.2891148	4.1055476	0.3199	0.420759515229	1.248222611	15885	10812	14961.642	11152.488	3.6681617	2.8542949	-0.3619	-0.503866365649	0.778126712	19965	19844	18523.572	20459.035	4.0754169	4.5467785	0.1579	-0.012994778605	1.115659713	3470	3782	3428.4547	3836.4222	0.8192991	0.9263456	0.1772	0.152836038187	1.130656114	17197	17989	16120.055	18583.537	3.7483736	4.1528306	0.1478	0.235274515596	1.10790215	3543	3923	3499.5241	3983.0553	0.7261212	0.831021	0.1947	0.188395100636	1.14446616	4167	4981	4102.83	5066.1835	0.8425846	1.0484758	0.3154	0.0808270933241	1.244356717	715	623	689.1925	670.6634	0.1791751	0.1696969	-0.0784	0.0975164116205	0.947100818	10258	9927	9857.1412	10237.173	1.8755119	1.9364687	0.0461	0.0992328489362	1.032501319	1719	1876	1695.9728	1925.0008	0.4805029	0.549554	0.1937	0.167064862588	1.143705820	2055	2331	2027.9465	2379.2927	0.5580532	0.6671701	0.2577	0.188925618204	1.1955313!sample_table_end
