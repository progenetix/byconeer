Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481547/suppl/GSM481547_EL169.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4928	4524	4908.6139	4423.9564	1.3448709	1.1571552	0.2169	0.11937052091	1.16222172	7353	5774	7087.4051	5685.9846	1.9119175	1.6110667	0.2470	0.0372160477035	1.18674013	3385	3866	3475.66	3763.9525	1.1655411	1.0331154	0.1740	0.00312768826266	1.1281814	12879	12088	11702.43	12307.874	3.5856162	3.4242347	0.0664	-0.146434519659	1.04712925	11216	13389	10356.621	13689.814	4.1745405	4.4894865	-0.1049	-0.158877794858	0.92984816	5625	7666	5553.1302	7629.6511	2.0543806	2.3213277	-0.1762	-0.123772275617	0.88500247	1657	2355	1818.3718	2260.2546	0.6935483	0.7887416	-0.1856	-0.166612399573	0.879318	3217	3173	3310.3424	3062.3809	0.835144	0.7862161	0.0871	-0.043731926454	1.06223219	4244	4449	4276.301	4350.251	0.9874094	1.1560354	-0.2275	0.0153427011586	0.854134310	20329	15483	17725.958	15930.397	4.096831	4.2624356	-0.0572	0.097636818835	0.961147911	21500	18204	18676.12	18865.783	4.4205286	4.9779698	-0.1713	-0.112236930328	0.888018412	10787	11530	10004.494	11714.88	3.1965941	3.5955569	-0.1697	-0.232148110459	0.889040113	6848	6757	6645.954	6689.9586	1.8254022	2.0217639	-0.1474	-0.0117102449524	0.90287614	9924	10125	9284.3416	10243.433	3.1529786	3.1187004	0.0158	0.0154805846584	1.010991215	3665	3874	3745.0364	3772.1312	1.0187174	1.0161675	0.0036	0.15084870652	1.002509316	2907	4145	3019.9735	4047.0527	1.0272021	1.2642575	-0.2996	-0.0304451200844	0.812494417	1349	1552	1515.8143	1456.602	0.4041481	0.4057313	-0.0056	0.147647043475	0.996097918	4834	5615	4821.828	5518.624	1.902885	1.8357629	0.0518	0.0539077623619	1.036563619	4068	4006	4115.8763	3906.5823	1.0179883	1.1067288	-0.1206	0.0182604207163	0.919817320	4986	3585	4962.8578	3476.1937	0.9208188	0.8364118	0.1387	0.05185289674	1.1009156!sample_table_end
