Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481462/suppl/GSM481462_DE357.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4232	2952	4217.3609	2882.0843	1.938523	1.3343048	-0.5389	-0.085924499059	0.688312	1509	1796	1601.1839	1731.5163	0.7958069	0.8868493	0.1563	0.224295687682	1.11440273	4543	3374	4500.168	3292.9553	1.8692142	1.3944382	-0.4227	0.119234514036	0.74600234	4558	5621	4513.9224	5542.2367	1.813109	2.2670245	0.3223	0.00431168109464	1.2503525	13048	14632	11934.582	15583.647	5.1845701	6.6964595	0.3692	0.0108089071545	1.29161326	6480	5404	6261.2973	5322.5821	2.7424621	2.3374885	-0.2305	-0.299487429818	0.85233217	2145	2336	2228.7849	2259.2385	0.8719055	0.8533238	-0.0311	-0.0532648885	0.97868838	1684	1771	1776.3611	1706.8515	0.6119469	0.6044098	-0.0179	-0.131214840859	0.98768349	3015	2836	3070.745	2769.4803	1.3639981	1.2942079	-0.0758	0.114495762248	0.948834110	13887	10373	12641.499	10672.299	3.8484776	3.161315	-0.2838	-0.126446895961	0.821445611	39212	27264	33135.878	30769.7	10.915057	10.238856	-0.0923	-0.0582983245104	0.938048812	3309	4459	3349.1241	4376.8673	1.2409059	1.6275883	0.3913	0.294475950178	1.31161313	9114	7260	8573.6837	7261.9644	2.9338183	2.3625837	-0.3124	0.0534219517633	0.805293114	6492	6664	6272.0488	6624.3131	3.2667198	3.6460471	0.1585	0.116985487745	1.116118715	8020	6274	7620.5468	6213.2529	2.6383835	2.1237592	-0.3130	0.0753655906125	0.804947116	4045	3484	4048.2301	3400.8077	1.4816151	1.2186042	-0.2819	0.0838218444348	0.822483617	2530	1997	2601.0744	1928.298	1.2451203	0.9500174	-0.3903	0.0363228493007	0.762992418	4202	3269	4190.0959	3190.5401	1.9020186	1.4649621	-0.3767	-0.217013097399	0.770214419	4335	3367	4310.8434	3286.0944	1.9970266	1.5777176	-0.3400	-0.033949039457	0.790033420	2190	1813	2272.1759	1747.9866	0.5568623	0.4205649	-0.4050	0.113600627077	0.7552405!sample_table_end
