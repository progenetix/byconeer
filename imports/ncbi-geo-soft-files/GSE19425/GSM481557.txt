Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481557/suppl/GSM481557_EL215.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3153	2256	2966.5681	2411.7292	0.8705584	0.7041306	0.3061	0.0649718104388	1.23635922	4578	4112	4305.9622	4312.0029	1.3440162	1.4140224	-0.0733	-0.0298639115507	0.95049143	2453	1963	2296.0116	2111.4766	0.6353139	0.5628589	0.1747	-0.16482389633	1.12872664	10874	13644	10310.245	13775.084	2.8933454	3.9163095	-0.4368	-0.470894207874	0.73879385	20846	30493	19555.651	30637.671	5.525976	8.5005187	-0.6213	-0.263457483361	0.65007516	9505	11904	9024.4145	12052.449	2.7009069	3.5751081	-0.4045	-0.308098249271	0.75547557	2191	2782	2058.526	2965.7506	0.5967351	0.8295184	-0.4752	-0.185524487885	0.71937548	2305	3006	2161.5065	3192.6037	0.6443753	0.9519768	-0.5630	-0.164178849745	0.67688139	4022	3286	3790.2659	3474.8579	1.0618547	1.0321259	0.0410	0.118016521744	1.028803410	12336	11682	11673.115	11834.707	4.0189996	4.1249198	-0.0375	0.0888610006438	0.974321811	14546	15845	13758.213	15952.579	4.5108231	5.2686524	-0.2240	-0.328939488683	0.856162612	5544	7171	5237.5601	7398.3397	1.6972026	2.3374243	-0.4618	-0.438370441877	0.726099413	2589	2254	2426.0454	2409.6785	0.8502147	0.8236753	0.0458	-0.166040928897	1.032220714	11033	12127	10457.368	12271.049	3.3031845	3.9457846	-0.2565	-0.250026070173	0.837142615	2832	2239	2661.5525	2394.2998	0.8594087	0.7417667	0.2124	0.180559218895	1.15859716	2571	3409	2408.5194	3600.7695	0.7164763	1.0409322	-0.5389	-0.20709053822	0.688302517	774	527	746.5028	595.9855	0.2421571	0.2018789	0.2625	0.139949702238	1.199516618	5737	5905	5420.2155	6117.5729	1.3395041	1.5098935	-0.1727	-0.253129338837	0.887151419	2027	1511	1907.5228	1643.0981	0.6037549	0.5473902	0.1414	0.0453916647055	1.102969820	3504	2969	3297.3863	3155.3365	0.9628528	0.9449598	0.0271	-0.373159683985	1.0189352!sample_table_end
