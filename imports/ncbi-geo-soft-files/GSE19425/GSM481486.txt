Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481486/suppl/GSM481486_DE393.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1874	1990	1965.0602	1862.7444	1.2921721	1.1261654	-0.1984	-0.0538531472313	0.8715292	854	1569	910.8426	1475.5743	0.9065807	1.2448521	0.4575	0.540246732718	1.37312893	2729	2098	2844.0689	1957.4888	1.3637404	1.1585499	-0.2352	0.000199366678731	0.84953854	3315	3899	3436.8778	3602.9164	2.4035258	2.6935562	0.1644	0.358046236536	1.12066875	10212	10742	9892.5411	10289.411	5.1356178	6.7285127	0.3897	0.356182807549	1.31016626	6111	5467	6148.8185	5068.0005	2.9557854	2.9614408	0.0028	-0.05008647878	1.00191337	1811	1795	1903.0067	1683.3814	1.0366141	0.9189291	-0.1739	-0.065431686872	0.88647188	803	739	858.0297	708.8054	0.8084083	0.680022	-0.2495	-0.131249365628	0.84118649	914	1458	973.5146	1374.774	1.0518424	1.2439193	0.2420	0.075155530201	1.182609910	2795	3013	2911.5529	2787.6409	3.6855408	3.2913657	-0.1632	-0.236028522047	0.893048211	5814	6382	5867.9599	5942.3183	7.245895	6.9812554	-0.0537	-0.293806671943	0.963477312	2720	3662	2834.8646	3385.4047	1.6630207	2.0335545	0.2902	0.235274025354	1.222807713	4531	3641	4633.4288	3366.034	3.0427014	2.1686537	-0.4886	-0.443419497594	0.712739614	2904	5218	3022.7685	4831.1074	3.2674934	3.4215143	0.0665	0.0412084917341	1.047137315	3001	2607	3121.0542	2421.2897	2.1563015	1.6651803	-0.3729	-0.208673956877	0.772239116	2200	2165	2296.8624	2017.5769	1.1843959	1.0891491	-0.1209	-0.0532802922536	0.91958217	972	1015	1035.0366	967.2969	0.8895926	0.7113622	-0.3226	-0.203441399416	0.799649418	4077	3252	4184.4374	3009.138	1.6312989	1.4204063	-0.1997	-0.25497752386	0.870721119	1177	1457	1246.6608	1373.8592	1.2950235	1.1795842	-0.1347	-0.138455523107	0.910859320	502	484	538.719	472.9436	0.7384135	0.5557993	-0.4099	-0.213274746383	0.7526938!sample_table_end
