Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481833/suppl/GSM481833_MR157.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6637	6671	6700.5387	6536.569	1.3096511	1.240409	0.0784	0.0317981629227	1.0558222	5499	6545	5589.2645	6415.6752	1.0944413	1.2480033	-0.1894	-0.122609247752	0.87695383	6405	6226	6470.6698	6099.2344	1.3155829	1.1620009	0.1791	0.00735253846659	1.13217024	11180	12531	11118.686	12064.512	2.2933521	2.4672491	-0.1054	-0.261181882642	0.92951785	14135	16972	13971.182	16432.556	3.0319416	3.2958016	-0.1204	-0.203129280984	0.91994056	10488	11611	10439.691	11178.939	2.2676026	2.305345	-0.0238	0.0262215908423	0.98362837	3752	3954	3859.3389	3905.0327	0.7367234	0.7520931	-0.0298	-0.0222813147828	0.97956418	3935	3771	4034.2938	3724.9825	0.7469191	0.7185184	0.0559	0.105899828286	1.03952679	10792	11340	10739.163	10921.271	2.0352727	2.053189	-0.0126	0.0101579497125	0.991273810	21941	20798	21469.837	20281.303	3.6556934	3.8125511	-0.0606	0.00730445306484	0.958857511	29505	25750	28587.668	25341.211	4.8713266	4.7116978	0.0481	0.0859785121871	1.033879212	11441	12145	11368.027	11692.557	2.0205788	2.212559	-0.1309	-0.0446692355231	0.913231513	13498	13147	13349.296	12652.571	2.1940365	2.3359183	-0.0904	-0.00310824203481	0.939260814	13750	16213	13595.358	15673.835	2.7108126	2.9374324	-0.1158	-0.126498378685	0.92285115	8985	8159	8991.195	7932.5076	1.5376328	1.4527461	0.0819	0.0893445173319	1.058431916	7742	8365	7785.38	8126.9202	1.3720565	1.4852014	-0.1143	0.00442516558603	0.923818417	4097	4052	4196.9506	3999.5102	0.8203541	0.7730839	0.0856	0.0525579307112	1.061144918	5976	8375	6060.6528	8136.6373	1.2728807	1.5481595	-0.2825	-0.16518641189	0.822189619	6763	6845	6825.3226	6699.7719	1.3612044	1.3539345	0.0077	0.0290298923867	1.005369420	4053	4022	4152.7886	3970.5966	0.7432022	0.7856191	-0.0801	-0.103187791128	0.9460084!sample_table_end
