Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9775!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481637/suppl/GSM481637_JA696.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1554	845	1331.1157	1063.8237	0.7188749	0.5626161	0.3536	0.280586509044	1.27773612	1064	787	899.49769	999.3299	0.8651381	0.8154244	0.0854	0.111202021202	1.06096663	2639	1746	2303.0236	2007.782	1.5903141	1.2882627	0.3039	0.324111835787	1.2344644	3951	5686	3549.5116	5627.6569	2.3396603	3.4720295	-0.5695	-0.48852356063	0.67385955	4920	8893	4474.1542	8496.3334	4.1286789	6.6353292	-0.6845	-0.546543801488	0.62222666	5225	4072	4760.3601	4179.9265	2.8447488	2.1974614	0.3725	0.317830799036	1.29456147	3049	1321	2690.4565	1580.7534	1.5253314	0.7895843	0.9500	0.989916254326	1.93181568	3290	2281	2923.874	2528.4385	1.1876858	1.0396277	0.1921	0.203670386661	1.14241459	3091	1251	2731.3321	1505.3117	1.7524157	0.8608721	1.0255	0.784536396091	2.035628310	12849	11324	12173.024	10671.078	3.3943777	3.6291976	-0.0965	-0.0235559715469	0.93529711	5329	3749	4859.3077	3881.2487	1.9881026	1.633158	0.2837	0.0849047300472	1.217336312	4492	5190	4066.3268	5181.5489	1.7804044	2.3921506	-0.4261	-0.301501208244	0.744269313	2982	2026	2625.3716	2286.9065	1.1799361	1.0785656	0.1296	0.0394183408474	1.093986314	5911	5871	5431.9569	5793.5981	2.8847993	3.0549236	-0.0827	-0.285262337424	0.944311415	1742	1066	1490.2679	1307.9404	0.5067655	0.5090002	-0.0063	0.0619767441746	0.995609616	2349	2048	2035.7817	2308.0874	1.6991604	1.7776424	-0.0651	-0.0161556991482	0.955850517	705	452	582.58691	606.3266	0.2139965	0.2447764	-0.1939	-0.2177784104	0.874252918	2124	1176	1838.8458	1425.3167	1.4724716	1.007761	0.5471	0.514116603027	1.461131719	1603	801	1372.5404	1015.0056	0.6801108	0.5221937	0.3812	0.25361030486	1.302410820	1825	1355	1562.2901	1616.8862	1.0245667	0.9907189	0.0485	0.0913716238766	1.0341649!sample_table_end
