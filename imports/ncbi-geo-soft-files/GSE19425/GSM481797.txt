Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481797/suppl/GSM481797_MR039.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3383	3419	3468.9477	3319.1241	1.2057578	1.135438	0.0867	0.0328006450623	1.06193192	2155	2382	2238.7066	2299.9135	1.1063371	0.9335567	0.2450	0.126080408156	1.18507753	3117	3064	3198.6715	2969.3123	1.0811104	1.0470633	0.0462	0.0240113889994	1.03251674	10905	10712	10729.959	10605.528	3.5814935	3.6856095	-0.0413	-0.0118360897093	0.97175075	20259	19083	19440.92	19279.202	6.294598	6.7559377	-0.1020	-0.0133408660937	0.93171356	6644	7124	6656.5598	6963.4256	3.1547106	3.1435304	0.0051	-0.047614601921	1.00355667	2879	2737	2962.3515	2649.9792	0.9958671	0.9515443	0.0657	0.0521799239585	1.04657998	2296	2522	2379.1611	2439.2912	0.7777044	0.8470116	-0.1232	0.0614659934446	0.91817459	2889	3843	2972.1652	3735.8117	1.3659457	1.3510633	0.0158	0.0448861955418	1.011015310	14883	13852	14453.163	13836.623	5.5615048	5.5577335	0.0010	0.042729635982	1.000678611	17022	14951	16451.012	14975.117	6.1910381	6.0215616	0.0400	0.0434679791687	1.028144912	6319	7306	6338.5602	7145.67	2.2558701	2.7471101	-0.2842	-0.0188243376865	0.821179413	3904	4581	3979.0574	4468.1718	1.5886788	1.8150518	-0.1922	-0.0828138387521	0.875280214	8544	10677	8493.1982	10569.714	2.8020194	3.2643719	-0.2203	-0.0193440014069	0.85836415	4418	4030	4487.2171	3920.4624	1.4127018	1.3606401	0.0542	0.0046339882426	1.038262716	4155	4439	4223.8453	4327.8353	1.4902914	1.5873501	-0.0910	-0.113507413357	0.938854917	1045	4086	1099.8947	3975.8711	0.5319466	1.5831674	-1.5735	-0.84276912687	0.336001518	4154	5809	4222.8706	5666.0699	2.17982	2.5310943	-0.2156	0.0430191093023	0.861216519	2176	2834	2259.8613	2743.4504	0.8782874	0.9570978	-0.1240	-0.101489539499	0.917656920	1354	1558	1418.9498	1504.3409	0.5873736	0.598489	-0.0270	-0.120191398317	0.9814275!sample_table_end
