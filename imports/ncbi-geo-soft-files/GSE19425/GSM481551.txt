Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481551/suppl/GSM481551_EL173.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5028	4340	4839.4123	4484.5049	1.478377	1.3831264	0.0961	0.0170530371278	1.06886612	1985	1860	1930.8541	1933.2005	0.5806701	0.6000882	-0.0475	-0.136816038529	0.96764123	3453	4683	3328.2053	4833.4946	1.0461681	1.4473744	-0.4683	-0.413061072691	0.7228044	17004	17021	16074.354	17245.824	4.9033418	5.3099025	-0.1149	-0.200598485949	0.92343355	19759	25638	18542.643	25887.863	6.9774691	9.0253053	-0.3713	-0.357695220399	0.77310066	8276	9735	7938.6831	9947.9332	2.9190981	3.5341413	-0.2758	-0.272417469633	0.82597097	1753	2232	1708.0687	2316.8437	0.5895118	0.7774587	-0.3992	-0.257818071384	0.75825478	3520	3602	3391.4249	3719.7144	1.0404034	1.1744386	-0.1748	-0.184114752858	0.88587299	4207	4059	4052.68	4192.874	1.0842713	1.1671414	-0.1063	-0.0771258802929	0.928997310	17037	15880	16104.521	16111.602	5.2729689	5.5665859	-0.0782	-0.10566093976	0.947253611	18440	20229	17365.626	20454.119	5.3867761	6.6577968	-0.3056	-0.241220569043	0.809092912	15091	18108	14324.08	18335.583	4.606997	5.8874164	-0.3538	-0.338475065909	0.782515913	5769	7019	5557.819	7194.4308	1.59925	2.1389476	-0.4195	-0.287132142581	0.747680714	13319	17447	12695.044	17671.119	4.8307862	6.3119275	-0.3858	-0.269624737425	0.765342415	3849	4133	3707.0682	4269.9641	1.1247531	1.3103868	-0.2204	-0.0302559692183	0.858336616	5250	6531	5052.4999	6700.7559	1.5600321	2.0539285	-0.3968	-0.168664146588	0.759535717	563	520	546.2643	550.7656	0.173472	0.1796711	-0.0507	-0.194048042978	0.965497218	4937	5157	4752.4357	5310.6567	1.916266	1.9930107	-0.0567	-0.093128209563	0.96149319	3176	2906	3068.447	3009.0462	0.9432213	0.969722	-0.0400	-0.0509580542672	0.972671920	5282	4619	5083.8443	4768.6844	1.4595547	1.4960579	-0.0356	-0.0764890822342	0.9756004!sample_table_end
