Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481714/suppl/GSM481714_JBH212.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4848	6949	5331.1166	6321.6631	1.3666275	1.436221	0.0717	0.167511952584	1.05092352	3044	4908	3429.0531	4421.1053	1.1470738	1.271775	0.1489	0.343125566583	1.10871253	3501	5184	3912.9284	4668.6605	0.9580927	1.0197823	0.0900	0.240966860032	1.06438794	9455	12366	10032.22	11444.247	1.9354631	2.0896269	0.1106	0.195867504844	1.07965215	16412	18763	16903.923	17722.324	4.4351429	4.2983069	-0.0452	0.0689565013368	0.96914736	5976	10224	6502.3235	9405.1847	1.815372	2.2732489	0.3245	0.193528530238	1.2522227	4144	4205	4588.0944	3783.8336	0.8105961	0.7414409	-0.1287	-0.0182049972255	0.91468598	4122	4841	4565.2368	4361.1675	0.7005928	0.6716651	-0.0608	-0.0575822443305	0.95870969	6486	10126	7015.5444	9312.7717	2.2599855	2.5622824	0.1811	0.12584917763	1.133760510	20476	23222	20815.929	22208.072	2.8886191	3.3058582	0.1946	0.132654749389	1.144442411	37071	35565	36198.32	34992.722	5.2028606	5.3871115	0.0502	0.0747440846926	1.035413412	6619	7603	7151.1238	6921.0405	0.952736	1.0878233	0.1913	0.0971371913292	1.141788813	16430	14438	16921.471	13488.323	2.0583859	1.9966051	-0.0440	0.168035308641	0.969985814	4601	9608	5070.2968	8824.4568	2.579607	3.3439365	0.3744	0.445340555978	1.296296915	12676	12371	13276.028	11449.16	1.6975494	1.727884	0.0256	0.13553053576	1.017869616	9056	10190	9637.8867	9373.1198	1.3215327	1.4794775	0.1629	0.159387898471	1.119516417	1756	2590	2040.3493	2306.3722	0.64179	0.6326322	-0.0207	0.203597349617	0.985730818	2986	4823	3367.5013	4345.064	1.4525145	1.5382619	0.0827	0.0299975615654	1.059033719	3789	5248	4220.5113	4726.46	1.2569316	1.2505769	-0.0073	0.0325934623376	0.994944320	4855	5652	5338.4988	5097.0052	0.7375284	0.734419	-0.0061	0.00991152615202	0.9957841!sample_table_end
