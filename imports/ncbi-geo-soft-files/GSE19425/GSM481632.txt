Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9775!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481632/suppl/GSM481632_JA687.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	546	1332	789.481	1044.61	0.5131147	0.6032337	0.2334	-0.0354669122969	1.17563122	1291	2765	1630.4996	2259.2417	0.652352	0.7457137	0.1930	0.0301836426119	1.14311543	3022	4823	3435.3802	4129.0153	1.0523227	1.2691779	0.2703	0.182310028022	1.20607284	3245	3910	3654.6945	3278.2784	3.0660512	2.2688445	-0.4344	-0.456244306386	0.73998915	19940	15073	18267.635	14404.3	6.9456032	4.7610167	-0.5448	-0.515358315588	0.6854726	6233	9856	6526.7022	9064.0129	2.1381613	2.8642276	0.4218	0.295309490642	1.3395757	2130	4386	2526.8825	3721.7441	0.8282426	1.1842338	0.5158	0.552325127236	1.4298158	1785	2564	2162.8355	2077.4163	0.8021574	0.8543073	0.0909	0.0418333989646	1.0650129	4896	6023	5258.1094	5275.916	1.5804774	1.5087245	-0.0670	0.0860361423186	0.954600510	6558	7491	6826.7287	6725.5835	3.7999687	4.3835375	0.2061	0.134953734721	1.15357211	3648	5462	4053.3874	4737.8416	2.4248441	2.5258082	0.0589	-0.120605418961	1.041637312	4100	5452	4501.0951	4728.3219	2.1630103	2.0975528	-0.0443	-0.263173436398	0.969737713	1094	2258	1407.8585	1814.8852	0.9561337	1.0604778	0.1494	-0.040092643226	1.109131314	10685	7349	10477.533	6586.6424	6.3928814	3.4052337	-0.9087	-0.393092981503	0.532660215	828	1387	1117.5464	1089.5601	0.5021405	0.574114	0.1932	-0.0333344530986	1.143333516	1753	3344	2127.9813	2765.9803	1.8459817	1.7399265	-0.0854	-0.0307861346133	0.94254817	836	1021	1126.472	794.6697	0.4278789	0.3675144	-0.2194	-0.082279451889	0.858921418	2058	3576	2452.1241	2972.9519	0.877689	1.0200473	0.2169	0.00824405287137	1.162196719	1621	2301	1982.8461	1850.4812	0.649965	0.7106764	0.1288	0.113212540392	1.093407120	3220	4302	3630.2949	3643.9648	1.0900485	1.0969624	0.0091	0.0685203085721	1.0063427!sample_table_end
