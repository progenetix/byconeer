Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481783/suppl/GSM481783_JBH559.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1045	1232	1241.4595	1029.6026	1.0739297	0.8045492	0.4166	0.154934929211	1.33482162	913	1194	1093.9382	997.12177	1.1489766	0.9349007	0.2975	0.322039466646	1.22898253	1041	1472	1236.9869	1237.0647	0.8613605	0.8172305	0.0759	0.0729395436128	1.05399934	7426	6180	7642.4242	5441.9952	4.8562885	3.7217575	0.3839	-0.0130307069259	1.30483745	13238	12332	13052.078	11224.158	10.720131	8.6287332	0.3131	0.282960919678	1.2423766	3837	5140	4138.445	4486.0362	3.1406453	3.2923043	-0.0680	0.026772869154	0.95393537	1570	1812	1816.4185	1530.3576	1.2790483	1.0860228	0.2360	0.0897584633002	1.17773618	1488	1614	1726.2368	1357.4078	1.0278033	0.9110707	0.1739	-0.031114507819	1.12812689	1375	1790	1601.5061	1511.5601	1.5413592	1.2876009	0.2595	0.0927398918914	1.197078410	6698	7378	6941.7306	6554.0718	3.8808119	4.1999185	-0.1140	0.0879358318967	0.924020711	8224	8230	8405.0236	7350.8392	4.9610947	5.145994	-0.0528	0.0273399334036	0.964069212	5249	4227	5542.2472	3650.0618	3.3653902	2.4514159	0.4572	0.162648966553	1.372835213	1960	2802	2224.2557	2390.8977	1.2863837	1.4571077	-0.1798	-0.0135869967348	0.882833614	3730	5561	4032.4013	4874.978	5.4527591	4.4473072	0.2941	0.115305903859	1.22608115	1073	1455	1272.7374	1222.6945	0.712073	0.7877018	-0.1456	-0.0399332512435	0.903987916	1371	2226	1597.1881	1887.9173	0.9113201	1.1932775	-0.3889	-0.0415781966255	0.763711717	273	526	350.96861	444.90226	0.3799578	0.4383152	-0.2061	0.0480406969976	0.866859718	1370	2546	1596.1085	2169.9912	1.4493344	1.5072554	-0.0565	-0.0499218568459	0.961571819	496	976	627.83862	816.27904	0.5917459	0.7226376	-0.2883	-0.0843255411858	0.818869520	1862	1674	2121.3494	1409.9787	1.0587559	0.7886721	0.4249	0.0411661486133	1.3424538!sample_table_end
