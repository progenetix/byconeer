Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481621/suppl/GSM481621_EL691.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2854	2764	2983.4864	2622.4964	0.8824871	0.8978289	-0.0249	0.0146529431082	0.98291232	3216	3049	3356.4271	2888.3206	1.1733896	1.0521443	0.1573	0.00565566167161	1.11523623	1632	1587	1716.6216	1547.5555	0.5310073	0.5166923	0.0394	0.194211895324	1.02770514	21117	13684	20012.7	13062.837	6.6023108	4.9926699	0.4032	-0.122191103059	1.32240085	14092	23222	13796.764	22753.549	5.4237203	8.767709	-0.6929	0.0270843927112	0.61860176	15095	13478	14699.947	12856.147	4.8705943	4.6695989	0.0608	-0.0144168429787	1.04304337	1605	2591	1687.8471	2461.6475	1.0033482	1.1770391	-0.2303	0.129503015286	0.8524348	1928	2189	2024.2183	2093.7017	0.7319702	0.8312664	-0.1835	-0.0150000093519	0.88054829	5998	5215	6150.0208	4891.5525	2.1170944	1.7059397	0.3115	0.125142167678	1.241013610	16322	17346	15797.324	16742.076	6.3129454	6.6418074	-0.0733	0.145277422728	0.95048611	5926	7681	6079.6231	7206.1867	2.3742671	2.897421	-0.2873	-0.0186583338568	0.819441512	4126	4525	4262.3722	4243.5931	2.3096723	2.0771371	0.1531	-0.000226232319489	1.111949813	1144	1180	1191.6994	1177.3479	0.6420071	0.5369779	0.2577	0.274135444151	1.19559314	5390	6631	5554.9628	6219.5014	2.353736	2.3804101	-0.0163	0.110642801083	0.988794315	998	947	1033.2919	969.881	0.4681518	0.4101624	0.1908	0.194835445187	1.141381516	916	1209	940.784	1203.2294	0.5211936	0.5782332	-0.1498	0.086765290833	0.901355417	595	504	536.277	576.3432	0.1783486	0.2080587	-0.2223	0.0589825101676	0.857203418	5306	5780	5472.0392	5426.5772	1.6876179	1.6505137	0.0321	0.0199459600881	1.022480419	1198	1285	1249.8452	1269.8156	0.421856	0.460746	-0.1272	0.145438388156	0.915593320	3098	2572	3234.2937	2444.3515	1.0624384	0.8834178	0.2662	0.156083319056	1.2026454!sample_table_end
