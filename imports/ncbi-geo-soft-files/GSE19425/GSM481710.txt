Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481710/suppl/GSM481710_JBH206.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6035	7018	6590.161	6314.0472	1.5257038	1.1877577	-0.3612	-0.309588518808	0.77849822	3555	4900	3974.1993	4371.2734	0.942183	0.8915927	-0.0796	0.0499291726184	0.94630523	5364	6216	5889.6569	5569.9966	1.3564941	1.0694699	-0.3430	-0.136749213113	0.78840734	10245	12105	10855.934	11156.105	2.1945948	2.170655	-0.0158	0.122174132681	0.98909145	13122	16187	13701.295	15126.849	3.7595035	3.6056117	-0.0603	-0.0174081311751	0.95906596	8731	13473	9332.7762	12472.233	2.3261667	2.5909629	0.1555	0.249871624068	1.11383377	3146	3252	3543.8901	2914.9049	1.0246922	0.9879249	-0.0527	-0.0544865020378	0.96411878	4002	5625	4454.7777	5036.0573	0.8534761	0.9296541	0.1233	0.142667251448	1.08925619	6811	9344	7390.2161	8495.5637	1.6482802	1.6816226	0.0289	0.021204807404	1.020228610	22305	21814	22908.138	20569.375	3.929161	3.9698149	0.0149	0.0410581820521	1.010346711	26660	22827	27225.421	21557.897	4.7139929	4.1489946	-0.1842	-0.14357623635	0.880144412	5276	5913	5796.9363	5298.3538	1.3504566	1.3805148	0.0318	-0.043761876889	1.022257813	9424	8551	10033.665	7745.9289	1.910582	1.8141313	-0.0747	-0.307225239979	0.949517714	6516	7646	7090.7449	6902.2877	2.0763953	1.812825	-0.1958	-0.178028205421	0.873063515	4564	4417	5054.7603	3930.1017	1.0250417	0.8639784	-0.2466	-0.208411127672	0.842871516	5274	5169	5794.8359	4617.958	1.379076	1.2887557	-0.0977	-0.209352072607	0.934506717	2324	2772	2633.5604	2504.7589	0.613292	0.4842641	-0.3408	-0.342378468723	0.789614318	6284	8057	6850.0695	7283.3543	1.83048	1.714785	-0.0942	-0.0792721195403	0.936795319	8401	9933	8996.8647	9065.8975	1.8446345	1.7201675	-0.1008	-0.12241456124	0.932524920	5324	5093	5847.4859	4548.4275	0.9139693	0.775873	-0.2363	-0.136494803628	0.8489049!sample_table_end
