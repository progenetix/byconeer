Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481925/suppl/GSM481925_MR349.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2758	3406	2900.206	3220.7198	0.9769534	1.0914592	-0.1599	-0.0316497078785	0.89508932	3327	3073	3501.7008	2905.4783	1.2868492	1.1066038	0.2177	0.0983149835149	1.16288163	3462	2782	3642.4604	2635.0062	1.1963876	0.8530159	0.4880	0.0837053157209	1.40253844	14159	15658	14317.306	14989.32	4.4805682	4.6400017	-0.0504	-0.18883376791	0.96563935	15701	18583	15819.923	17828.766	6.1173297	6.701045	-0.1315	-0.232200168417	0.91289196	11685	12411	11889.709	11827.272	4.2691147	4.2282408	0.0139	-0.0350016123024	1.00966697	2337	2225	2465.0821	2111.7203	1.062512	0.9153198	0.2151	0.0837039543485	1.16080968	3275	4042	3447.5336	3816.858	0.9852831	1.1046846	-0.1650	-0.0406596910083	0.89191359	3980	4956	4180.0859	4673.3913	1.4425648	1.6835024	-0.2228	-0.0598334299716	0.856883110	13160	11354	13339.535	10802.118	4.5858201	3.7741547	0.2810	0.0512914895361	1.215058911	6841	11652	7097.0569	11087.83	2.2803532	3.5583338	-0.6419	-0.385386279086	0.640848612	6768	7829	7024.7098	7410.139	2.6888212	2.7849088	-0.0507	-0.227712297245	0.96549713	2468	2820	2598.89	2670.5951	1.2483057	1.2834579	-0.0401	-0.0359364002992	0.972611414	10057	12182	10290.51	11602.361	3.9417644	4.5535998	-0.2082	-0.220582993463	0.86563715	2405	2664	2534.4147	2524.6411	0.8273162	0.8173552	0.0175	0.0129084444855	1.012186916	2007	2608	2117.7413	2472.6035	0.7808037	0.9097752	-0.2206	-0.0926376010055	0.858238117	1595	1251	1685.8523	1210.8117	0.6247738	0.4693725	0.4126	0.245055668058	1.331083118	4968	5519	5187.0171	5196.4541	1.8806167	1.8135679	0.0524	0.0279124350658	1.036970719	1749	1698	1847.9461	1623.0458	0.6836269	0.6308561	0.1159	0.0484249514839	1.083649620	2987	3251	3143.9404	3073.5635	0.9005152	0.9136124	-0.0208	-0.0890083361962	0.9856645!sample_table_end
