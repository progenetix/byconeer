Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481569/suppl/GSM481569_EL631.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4134	3500	4431.8741	3221.4601	0.8612473	0.6876327	0.3248	0.0386970231855	1.25248162	4887	7120	5202.836	6627.953	1.4225115	1.6656576	-0.2277	-0.1200132335	0.85402393	2775	2654	3000.0461	2445.2212	0.5574216	0.5540242	0.0088	-0.0182203964098	1.00613224	18358	18604	18185.574	18101.015	4.4070034	4.5593673	-0.0490	-0.140160626103	0.96658225	20449	28333	20088	28357.894	4.3181203	7.1477477	-0.7271	-0.189875751568	0.60412326	12283	10489	12514.16	9875.6587	2.5256434	2.5123871	0.0076	-0.182453884739	1.00527637	1765	2929	1930.0384	2693.3267	0.8875722	1.1257608	-0.3430	0.0317617523488	0.78841988	2051	2527	2240.0103	2327.8776	0.7404263	0.7351342	0.0103	-0.0230492573686	1.00719889	3560	3677	3834.7615	3385.4596	1.0072012	0.8062627	0.3210	0.0922182650361	1.249221910	9859	11742	10189.903	11117.371	5.0113982	5.0741999	-0.0180	0.0712706140347	0.987623311	9392	9013	9728.9878	8447.6141	4.1386949	3.3129259	0.3211	0.020593228147	1.249256612	6621	6846	6957.8495	6364.1212	3.0847634	2.7525764	0.1644	-0.000359578838322	1.120682113	1193	1068	1319.3054	996.7491	0.7644052	0.5821765	0.3929	0.0754651326816	1.313012814	8394	10559	8737.1082	9943.6933	2.5485371	2.5109446	0.0214	-0.0956878141514	1.014971415	1255	1406	1387.2575	1302.5859	0.539958	0.470281	0.1993	0.0663831085539	1.148160116	1151	1745	1273.2212	1611.2586	0.5406374	0.6417699	-0.2474	-0.0536284100416	0.842416217	559	412	601.08995	425.7164	0.1516163	0.1079576	0.4900	0.104647309066	1.404405518	5348	5300	5671.6978	4903.2287	1.2528412	1.2279298	0.0290	-0.0725197394545	1.020287319	1796	1862	1962.8024	1718.9282	0.5580534	0.4646856	0.2641	0.0434934566756	1.200926820	1482	1935	1631.4133	1785.1521	0.7402331	0.7831641	-0.0813	-0.282658425215	0.9451827!sample_table_end
