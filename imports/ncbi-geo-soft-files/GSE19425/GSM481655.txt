Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481655/suppl/GSM481655_JA811.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5039	4901	4893.6661	4918.656	1.3190799	1.3299709	-0.0119	-0.0468248013772	0.9918112	4421	3207	4284.0607	3273.664	1.4874088	0.9948182	0.5803	0.362711809196	1.49515633	3609	3218	3510.8562	3284.7283	1.1256787	1.0565408	0.0914	0.0164389817913	1.06543794	9886	7605	9441.3382	7521.5074	2.68533	2.2419887	0.2603	-0.0456254989265	1.19774465	10392	10207	9908.2143	10075.645	3.9548163	4.1528972	-0.0705	-0.255255691198	0.95230296	9664	6536	9235.9469	6495.9209	3.1283344	2.208809	0.5021	0.369994830661	1.41629917	1418	870	1379.9646	953.9474	0.8819582	0.6855938	0.3634	0.258570058827	1.2864158	3944	2440	3822.0814	2528.1033	0.9856546	0.6733822	0.5497	0.425832445082	1.46373739	4221	3803	4087.1932	3853.4399	1.4629896	1.1439739	0.3549	0.217462645709	1.278866210	10369	10978	9887.099	10846.082	2.361883	2.6569993	-0.1699	0.0475784514366	0.888928711	25513	20380	23432.587	20436.843	5.9099594	5.3983183	0.1306	0.0325099602748	1.094777812	4865	4489	4723.8193	4531.3992	1.7272379	1.8413589	-0.0923	-0.156664348904	0.938023413	6462	5939	6219.2048	5937.3107	1.6254964	1.8439982	-0.1820	0.0488120325252	0.881506414	6959	7956	6704.5209	7861.3317	2.9484304	2.6922483	0.1311	-0.0361447589412	1.095155415	6840	5035	6589.344	5046.0281	1.8752913	1.5563757	0.2689	0.390944423168	1.204909116	2247	2295	2188.2249	2386.5193	0.9328435	1.1535619	-0.3064	-0.0653745030996	0.808663517	1555	1835	1513.8402	1938.8226	0.456609	0.5610788	-0.2972	-0.263295886265	0.813805418	3759	4270	3650.0166	4318.394	1.5881152	1.6899272	-0.0896	0.0310566455274	0.939753619	3291	4096	3203.7454	4144.9425	1.0198068	1.1527289	-0.1768	0.0113112826929	0.884689120	2708	2509	2637.8901	2594.7839	0.5958768	0.5552719	0.1018	-0.175467884362	1.073126!sample_table_end
