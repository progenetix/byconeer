Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481623/suppl/GSM481623_EL693.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3857	3452	3852.5469	3405.1044	1.1856577	1.1402913	0.0563	0.132823181968	1.03978492	3051	3059	3025.5776	3035.8874	1.0995939	1.0909754	0.0114	-0.0805842624397	1.00789983	2126	1744	2064.8286	1822.3056	0.7270702	0.6697884	0.1184	0.202348131999	1.08552244	15445	12168	15145.788	11570.196	5.6267187	4.3608573	0.3677	-0.0185403538405	1.29027815	12882	20484	12713.399	19516.023	5.5523967	8.6953107	-0.6471	-0.0429522591337	0.63855076	12606	12413	12452.979	11801.38	4.5390317	4.5354121	0.0012	-0.0597567840071	1.00079817	1757	1747	1677.6183	1825.0231	1.2406986	1.298152	-0.0653	0.157819839479	0.95574228	1887	1953	1815.0021	2011.6008	0.7723929	0.8479649	-0.1347	-0.13798240485	0.91087849	5041	5165	5049.2245	5007.8627	1.7600758	1.6997222	0.0503	-0.0661174950596	1.035507910	9982	10564	9922.6349	10055.477	5.6447061	5.6381214	0.0017	0.184528372197	1.001167911	3162	6027	3137.9615	5801.7148	1.7336527	3.0716625	-0.8252	-0.476868899522	0.564402112	3742	3102	3733.5857	3075.5544	2.1661955	1.7035228	0.3466	0.16076210247	1.271597613	1202	1250	1069.8825	1365.4154	0.7296221	0.8250699	-0.1774	0.28436689503	0.884315514	4985	5248	4993.0889	5083.9171	1.7170357	1.8089625	-0.0752	0.0714570765981	0.949182515	1203	851	1071.0039	989.7726	0.5605524	0.5083786	0.1409	0.264203356687	1.102627816	1109	1045	967.1447	1173.7761	0.5726235	0.6682143	-0.2227	0.24763226227	0.85694617	820	724	649.2031	870.7317	0.2331621	0.3164174	-0.4405	-0.0968434028866	0.736881518	5756	5266	5763.399	5100.3992	1.9014998	1.8053518	0.0749	0.0439158697562	1.053257219	1714	1295	1630.6963	1406.1758	0.6417373	0.5324808	0.2693	0.418035764327	1.205183920	2537	2175	2494.3003	2219.5008	0.9905487	0.8879511	0.1577	0.00636208639719	1.1155442!sample_table_end
