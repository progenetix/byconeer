Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481774/suppl/GSM481774_JBH548.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2182	2139	2234.3395	2070.6034	1.0535777	0.9066447	-0.2167	-0.0498338779929	0.8605392	1500	2001	1543.2049	1941.9305	0.8954253	0.9566333	0.0954	0.145434083804	1.06835633	1806	2033	1853.9327	1971.6961	0.7806354	0.8334305	0.0944	0.195358308246	1.06763094	13601	9940	13152.578	9543.2601	4.8964005	3.9471004	-0.3109	-0.0868033098005	0.80612285	10821	13749	10544.574	13173.919	5.050436	6.3383632	0.3277	0.0549440285065	1.2550136	6848	6694	6765.3715	6423.971	3.166838	2.9424067	-0.1060	-0.103685737163	0.92913087	1491	1493	1534.3684	1453.8264	1.0088974	0.9476402	-0.0904	-0.228184534365	0.93928298	2671	2200	2713.6211	2129.0703	0.8810369	0.8125069	-0.1168	-0.104321210076	0.92221669	2186	2583	2238.3341	2501.9633	1.2523768	1.1811257	-0.0845	-0.10120686978	0.943107210	8579	8602	8427.0715	8259.8933	3.1212625	3.3857156	0.1173	-0.0156430744088	1.084726311	15485	11873	14908.116	11392.544	5.1470747	4.6703369	-0.1402	-0.0667480382369	0.907376912	4791	4216	4801.1931	4053.6309	2.5283502	2.4005065	-0.0749	0.0478393201727	0.949435913	2305	2589	2357.11	2507.7394	1.130557	1.2609139	0.1574	-0.00572800631047	1.115303214	4723	6980	4735.7997	6697.5807	3.6829536	3.5787262	-0.0414	0.0232834606236	0.971715	1743	1815	1789.7393	1765.2482	0.7663882	0.8696054	0.1823	0.0971127786424	1.134680116	1040	1431	1088.1515	1395.5063	0.644709	0.8776822	0.4451	0.0848248817263	1.361361717	639	979	682.3939	966.3758	0.3842082	0.4807975	0.3235	0.0811039771081	1.251398418	2802	3414	2845.8094	3291.3478	1.5498572	1.5082158	-0.0393	-0.071816112706	0.97313219	1130	1502	1179.4427	1462.4069	0.6737067	0.7571739	0.1685	0.0644147962911	1.123892320	1930	1748	1979.4339	1699.4903	0.761363	0.6941338	-0.1334	0.101922723726	0.9116987!sample_table_end
