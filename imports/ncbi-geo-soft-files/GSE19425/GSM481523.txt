Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481523/suppl/GSM481523_DE488.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6376	4676	6164.5541	4725.9506	1.3824534	1.0654612	0.3758	0.0904826169481	1.29751642	6304	6521	6099.9558	6660.0268	1.6388516	1.8320492	-0.1608	-0.114504320292	0.89454563	6929	5438	6670.0761	5540.6671	1.3872576	1.1652984	0.2515	0.160688796441	1.1904744	15414	15984	14062.723	16860.951	3.0635861	3.6841731	-0.2661	-0.216430599813	0.83155325	17616	18146	15862.118	19400.933	3.5041181	4.224132	-0.2696	-0.183470642178	0.82954746	10670	9752	10055.419	9996.8356	2.20471	2.2308057	-0.0170	-0.0842907447133	0.98830217	3991	4018	3957.7881	4046.2963	0.9217234	0.9178284	0.0061	0.0425046833721	1.00424368	2582	2869	2644.6634	2856.0962	0.5854787	0.6448337	-0.1393	-0.0569309907914	0.9079539	5415	4809	5281.3428	4868.8683	1.4387508	1.3171158	0.1274	0.0265279927423	1.092349410	17125	11263	15461.106	11608.792	4.4215136	3.4895848	0.3415	0.207665749821	1.2670611	22109	18975	19426.594	20386.951	5.0850792	5.540616	-0.1238	-0.297048132523	0.917782212	11745	12365	10987.975	12796.284	2.6962467	3.0607128	-0.1829	0.0479068675768	0.880921113	7860	5187	7539.1379	5277.0734	2.0301687	1.4229344	0.5127	0.189096466367	1.426747814	11637	10913	10894.567	11234.011	2.8386703	2.9158884	-0.0387	-0.0479067089607	0.973518115	7917	6312	7591.409	6441.2522	1.7263041	1.4221458	0.2796	0.0744898173584	1.213872816	6346	5451	6137.6461	5554.0305	1.398759	1.2403015	0.1735	0.125984694583	1.127757217	3059	2191	3091.1332	2149.6297	0.7752235	0.5540674	0.4846	0.221960454999	1.399150118	7935	7515	7607.5708	7695.7931	1.6418231	1.6186588	0.0205	-0.00688355196929	1.014310819	5754	4993	5597.8476	5069.2669	1.4327023	1.3280428	0.1094	-0.0242126921336	1.078807320	2263	2204	2344.8291	2163.0397	0.5533494	0.5207465	0.0876	0.0374973518538	1.0626079!sample_table_end
