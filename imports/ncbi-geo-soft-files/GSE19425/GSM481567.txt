Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481567/suppl/GSM481567_EL629.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2814	2700	2895.1682	2611.5175	0.8568939	0.7817737	0.1324	-0.0733082236115	1.09608942	4354	4005	4470.7718	3867.3635	1.3979902	1.2047118	0.2147	0.0711894582199	1.16043533	2704	2628	2784.661	2543.2716	0.7772963	0.7043037	0.1423	-0.0670781110719	1.10363784	12225	15251	12233.459	14616.24	3.5888145	4.4401329	-0.3071	-0.3133301647	0.80826735	13514	24775	13457.062	24062.626	4.2040958	7.2979487	-0.7957	-0.171930203949	0.57606546	8892	10390	9017.188	9908.4978	2.7704549	3.0887939	-0.1569	-0.236191205774	0.89693747	2032	3347	2105.3699	3238.167	0.7765371	1.171672	-0.5934	-0.228247975179	0.66275988	2235	2760	2312.5611	2668.4044	0.6641438	0.8003556	-0.2691	-0.099975340023	0.82981099	3907	4080	4015.9029	3939.1562	1.1850894	1.1401546	0.0558	-0.0287975942076	1.039411110	15235	17648	15087.863	16976.865	4.3576432	5.0018752	-0.1989	-0.0941595144711	0.871201911	9039	12675	9160.8391	12093.161	2.7448962	3.6701665	-0.4191	-0.561532289473	0.747894212	6436	7220	6583.2261	6907.233	2.1023684	2.2388221	-0.0907	-0.143586451738	0.939051113	1352	1643	1429.2123	1603.931	0.4843223	0.5229298	-0.1106	-0.145140670536	0.926170714	8493	9427	8626.5846	8997.5511	2.9680447	2.8697661	0.0486	-0.0722009475885	1.034246215	1962	2115	2034.0448	2053.3048	0.5876047	0.5999778	-0.0301	-0.0556284953482	0.979377416	1819	2457	1891.4802	2381.0258	0.622365	0.7792192	-0.3243	-0.0188221013748	0.798703417	718	644	780.87283	651.8124	0.2376893	0.198978	0.2565	0.0625873342982	1.194550618	4254	4792	4370.2896	4615.9018	1.2843121	1.3191428	-0.0386	-0.159072278002	0.973595919	1623	1651	1700.4662	1611.5306	0.5111755	0.4919444	0.0553	-0.0301233367719	1.039091920	2891	2707	2974.4762	2618.1507	0.8782368	0.7899783	0.1528	-0.00367032209539	1.1117227!sample_table_end
