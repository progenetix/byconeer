Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481729/suppl/GSM481729_JBH401.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2505	4013	2539.8007	4003.8494	0.7667867	1.1192428	-0.5456	-0.374963278896	0.68509412	3285	3998	3289.6595	3988.5479	1.5058207	1.5862672	-0.0751	-0.0558872117408	0.94928563	2820	3723	2844.7755	3708.0016	0.7274705	0.8498835	-0.2244	-0.124005097506	0.85596484	23465	22675	22413.738	22591.836	5.4080591	5.4321087	-0.0064	-0.0650514151003	0.99557265	23358	30047	22313.051	29894.119	6.1788296	7.4440824	-0.2688	-0.147064985774	0.83003246	13202	12775	12813.209	12789.306	3.5872548	3.2748636	0.1314	0.212812102056	1.09539057	4951	3911	4896.5465	3899.8298	1.3863025	1.1413137	0.2805	0.267084731804	1.21465518	5166	4042	5102.6323	4033.4321	1.1463863	0.9835592	0.2210	0.21135976945	1.16554889	1567	3009	1629.8295	2983.1848	0.7852067	1.1951907	-0.6061	-0.457866624285	0.656971910	18017	14397	17317.318	14396.87	3.1669027	3.0718501	0.0440	0.0125844054078	1.030943111	21324	17613	20409.127	17576.896	3.615203	3.6895907	-0.0294	-0.0500104683689	0.979838512	13336	15962	12939.173	15944.137	2.8719424	3.7613928	-0.3892	-0.0765984641186	0.763531613	4558	5162	4517.0487	5148.4776	0.9084691	1.0678271	-0.2332	-0.0901722223038	0.850764214	10707	14234	10421.527	14235.317	4.9845775	5.397502	-0.1148	-0.106116462773	0.923497115	4260	3752	4228.0246	3737.6114	0.7663161	0.7962178	-0.0552	-0.0576937457122	0.962445316	3354	3154	3356.0206	3128.6981	0.8367291	0.8020978	0.0610	0.0356447406892	1.043175817	529	588	506.1615	622.4207	0.1990256	0.2243738	-0.1729	-0.18139759745	0.887027118	5542	7411	5467.5113	7410.8245	1.5938143	1.8422433	-0.2090	-0.0975211874168	0.865148619	1098	1499	1150.2886	1489.8168	0.44442	0.5484375	-0.3034	-0.257423793523	0.810338520	2852	2935	2876.1932	2909.4795	0.6389275	0.7001762	-0.1321	-0.113381260449	0.9125238!sample_table_end
