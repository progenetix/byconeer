Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481754/suppl/GSM481754_JBH524.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2343	1697	2175.1784	1821.0357	1.1639391	0.960735	-0.2768	-0.142870322698	0.82541692	1716	1589	1588.1916	1710.46	0.9336292	0.9022213	-0.0494	0.0253772678236	0.96635943	1846	1387	1709.0887	1498.4446	0.9184584	0.8418145	-0.1257	-0.0240119758253	0.91655164	10155	5130	9363.6761	5324.425	4.9301427	2.9640431	-0.7341	-0.324208055243	0.60120845	15613	9632	14308.707	9823.6478	7.7429741	5.6719828	-0.4490	-0.48325759519	0.73253286	6646	4444	6148.8185	4630.6988	3.6405434	2.840121	-0.3582	-0.300175986783	0.78013667	1630	1258	1509.7189	1363.1099	1.0389894	0.9585626	-0.1162	-0.0843643459782	0.92259138	1893	1168	1753.6177	1270.2316	0.9978084	0.7463626	-0.4189	-0.32026029392	0.7480029	3309	2836	3071.1609	2991.712	1.721236	1.4989249	-0.1995	-0.112247004173	0.870842210	4204	3409	3899.4394	3588.4148	2.3582793	2.1744325	-0.1171	-0.157901748299	0.92204211	7550	5670	6982.0648	5869.6166	4.2646077	3.7134008	-0.1997	-0.209452339512	0.870748512	4861	2750	4496.6159	2902.259	3.0905612	2.0606282	-0.5848	-0.313139887095	0.666748913	1827	1557	1691.0953	1677.0544	1.2896116	1.2343103	-0.0632	-0.0510490760703	0.957117914	7295	5141	6747.433	5335.6536	4.0209373	2.7829661	-0.5309	-0.386913576775	0.692118715	1479	1329	1369.6853	1437.1616	0.8684216	0.9342193	0.1054	0.0450818324162	1.07576716	1266	1210	1171.7657	1313.5261	0.7609966	0.8876669	0.2221	-0.110483329125	1.166453217	858	875	787.3148	966.0528	0.4665615	0.5246538	0.1693	0.0105277925916	1.124511518	3477	2673	3230.1724	2823.1367	1.6072991	1.3992251	-0.2000	-0.171983319383	0.870544319	1294	1257	1198.3424	1362.0671	0.7344218	0.7685499	0.0655	-0.0249666032325	1.046469320	1579	1058	1462.3421	1155.8319	0.9295236	0.705135	-0.3986	-0.121797709191	0.7585982!sample_table_end
