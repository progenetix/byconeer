Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481607/suppl/GSM481607_EL673.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2431	2084	2532.4299	1981.5899	1.3771475	1.1866847	0.2147	0.163096138436	1.16049982	737	682	744.3779	691.656	0.6263632	0.5788218	0.1139	-0.035484581693	1.08213473	1601	1354	1663.027	1313.2837	0.7369635	0.6458089	0.1905	0.0709345635738	1.14114794	11684	12271	11812.347	11560.027	4.9424723	5.5251327	-0.1608	-0.288453289414	0.89454365	11938	24938	12056.726	24126.184	5.672252	11.576753	-1.0292	-0.306677287696	0.48996916	9190	11443	9396.1299	10758.137	4.9399436	6.2689263	-0.3437	-0.339100253745	0.78800477	1512	2114	1569.9551	2009.6048	0.930843	1.1307026	-0.2806	0.0547713923132	0.8232438	1796	2273	1866.2766	2157.9423	0.7538881	0.9703596	-0.3642	-0.302420557115	0.77691629	2454	2930	2556.593	2762.4176	2.1846302	2.3026124	-0.0759	-0.167428924523	0.948761510	10870	14644	11030.623	13866.292	6.1826803	7.7525625	-0.3264	-0.185326767095	0.797501511	7382	7129	7582.3286	6660.2046	3.7909686	3.3012847	0.1995	0.167705648563	1.148331312	4971	4773	5149.5235	4465.6158	2.7394379	2.3942542	0.1943	0.021030076615	1.144171713	1081	1108	1114.6491	1086.4017	0.7471468	0.6689592	0.1595	0.263233604221	1.116879314	3764	4631	3929.4571	4335.1551	4.1416762	4.1676739	-0.0090	0.0181337726894	0.99376215	997	1155	1023.7735	1129.9118	0.5101984	0.5620097	-0.1395	-0.00393407731626	0.907810616	854	1189	870.8002	1161.3775	0.4948252	0.6603311	-0.4163	0.0575755949151	0.749359117	395	252	364.8626	295.2205	0.2913936	0.2409726	0.2741	0.190583888549	1.209239518	2343	3008	2439.995	2834.1483	1.7813928	2.049348	-0.2022	-0.281672781932	0.869248519	832	928	846.9664	920.585	0.7307371	0.7895971	-0.1118	0.0634753306536	0.925455620	1312	1473	1357.4318	1425.0014	0.9205656	0.9220041	-0.0023	-0.205638203234	0.9984398!sample_table_end
