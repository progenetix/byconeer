Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481517/suppl/GSM481517_DE482.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6791	5784	6318.1914	6182.3931	1.3215675	1.3241814	-0.0029	-0.185270205428	0.9980262	5150	5073	4873.128	5368.6932	1.3865525	1.4338797	-0.0484	-0.125818022708	0.96699353	8097	6555	7443.2219	7043.513	1.4307514	1.4159605	0.0150	0.015200236248	1.01044584	21605	17188	18556.778	19084.126	3.6668254	3.9228542	-0.0974	-0.127691074598	0.9347345	17582	15443	15204.951	17121.655	3.6533305	4.2836075	-0.2296	-0.300347719911	0.8528636	14614	10485	12800.434	11531.74	2.6924937	2.5382696	0.0851	0.0249493909086	1.06075957	3819	3060	3684.2123	3152.4881	1.0292748	0.8471483	0.2809	0.241992680266	1.21498778	3139	3073	3065.0076	3166.6773	0.6101593	0.6520639	-0.0958	-0.0474454908066	0.93573549	4967	5322	4712.5703	5653.7092	1.2389144	1.4177395	-0.1945	-0.232983942249	0.87386610	27460	20454	23484.512	22777.757	5.1041368	5.171334	-0.0189	-0.0864206875402	0.987005811	28215	27078	24122.871	30413.891	5.1989069	6.8494206	-0.3978	-0.577849859764	0.759028712	15382	10716	13427.808	11790.772	3.5554562	3.0959708	0.1996	0.282773083923	1.148413913	5697	6064	5359.3574	6497.0795	1.4174834	1.6687878	-0.2355	-0.238879552259	0.849408914	7982	9403	7344.8129	10299.287	2.3175127	3.0365863	-0.3899	-0.355855281604	0.763196715	5674	5340	5338.8603	5674.3596	1.1743956	1.2903145	-0.1358	-0.136105925021	0.910162316	5818	6041	5467.1307	6471.2005	1.4315751	1.6514313	-0.2061	-0.13132859401	0.866869317	2160	1850	2158.7677	1873.6596	0.5305101	0.4503862	0.2362	0.0673111824174	1.177900318	8484	7762	7766.1293	8432.2246	1.8114277	2.0385649	-0.1704	-0.111581579836	0.888579819	7712	6794	7113.3804	7313.2065	1.6374787	1.6342334	0.0029	-0.0906402704061	1.001985820	2940	2825	2881.3024	2899.8644	0.5370748	0.5501827	-0.0348	-0.109998212398	0.9761755!sample_table_end
