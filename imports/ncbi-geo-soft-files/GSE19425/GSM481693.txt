Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481693/suppl/GSM481693_JBH093.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2865	3731	3122.507	3397.5789	0.9673328	1.0459952	-0.1128	-0.160633119219	0.92479662	3040	3752	3301.6689	3416.2188	1.2048039	1.1459121	0.0723	0.0355098971299	1.05139293	4727	5708	5023.9976	5239.8832	1.4862755	1.5868976	-0.0945	-0.15991662008	0.93659194	9799	9429	9939.9293	8809.4476	2.8367265	2.9358208	-0.0495	-0.0073111153938	0.96624645	16104	16270	15782.476	15535.94	5.0801749	4.9812164	0.0284	0.0440980654489	1.01986636	9691	10132	9837.7107	9493.552	3.0923308	3.0391151	0.0250	0.0172306736935	1.01751027	4866	4708	5164.1101	4291.0282	1.6462317	1.507415	0.1271	0.0990607178788	1.09208928	2297	2364	2521.0238	2151.7156	0.7418647	0.7210702	0.0410	0.0121839035205	1.02883849	3108	4203	3371.1323	3819.8986	1.1796721	1.1960342	-0.0199	-0.0258159918238	0.986319710	6713	9356	6986.5142	8738.6915	2.4893323	3.0952466	-0.3143	-0.230498649676	0.804243611	13861	13294	13725.071	12587.388	4.4257272	4.4140325	0.0038	-0.07563811888	1.002649412	5964	6573	6249.0503	6037.013	1.928247	2.0791372	-0.1087	-0.031670280013	0.927426513	2304	3917	2528.3288	3562.7652	1.060295	1.2867286	-0.2792	-0.262513958037	0.824023714	5757	8960	6045.2978	8345.0968	2.8181042	2.9519602	-0.0669	-0.0136319839709	0.954655215	4513	4653	4807.5113	4240.2031	1.4036549	1.3434179	0.0633	-0.0982095911308	1.044838616	2283	3039	2506.4124	2766.3496	0.7333498	0.9069827	-0.3066	-0.234003648107	0.808559817	1149	1320	1314.1413	1218.6492	0.4532218	0.4024054	0.1716	-0.0799816651679	1.126281718	3958	6395	4248.2457	5870.6635	1.6061204	1.9134579	-0.2526	-0.213802395577	0.83938119	2291	3099	2514.7613	2818.5473	0.8741531	0.9884099	-0.1772	-0.16280161506	0.884403420	1557	1744	1746.0565	1597.7823	0.6062015	0.5125451	0.2421	0.00291000874535	1.1827281!sample_table_end
