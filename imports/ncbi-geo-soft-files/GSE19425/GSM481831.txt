Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481831/suppl/GSM481831_MR153.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	8382	8908	8334.5584	8843.5473	1.3158998	1.3953996	-0.0846	-0.066661490108	0.94302722	5926	6159	5958.1731	6102.6265	1.0966974	1.1431463	-0.0598	-0.0370802437611	0.95936743	7135	8172	7120.6429	8100.1248	1.2161821	1.2539119	-0.0441	-0.146163357354	0.96991034	9901	11336	9783.1562	11267.777	1.8050422	2.2709165	-0.3312	-0.36994159993	0.79485185	14003	18750	13711.857	18803.688	2.7515594	3.0516667	-0.1493	-0.208991112737	0.90165796	10217	12806	10087.538	12749.788	1.9086457	2.1034785	-0.1402	-0.170873762702	0.90737597	6110	6725	6134.2872	6662.7966	0.8517881	0.9919186	-0.2197	-0.173648523816	0.85872788	3212	3523	3285.2296	3501.3201	0.56101	0.6360947	-0.1812	-0.140917055576	0.88195999	11124	10943	10968.146	10878.796	2.0742314	2.1188144	-0.0307	-0.0995134974376	0.978958510	16642	18438	16216.951	18481.224	3.3129739	3.9429251	-0.2511	-0.156352974139	0.840232511	25114	25767	24165.745	26095.682	4.6772219	5.444373	-0.2191	-0.153083964616	0.859092812	7160	8498	7144.4026	8429.9813	1.3711921	1.7359088	-0.3403	-0.328854936038	0.789898713	10926	12461	10779.447	12400.798	2.1805552	2.5039498	-0.1995	-0.0941694012744	0.870846214	12759	14344	12531.261	14313.73	2.2135566	2.3547282	-0.0892	-0.200340720701	0.940047515	8488	7779	8436.6808	7707.8536	1.3132628	1.2830932	0.0335	-0.0109615269044	1.023513116	5585	6018	5629.1115	5962.2202	1.176553	1.3565915	-0.2054	-0.102092425122	0.867286117	4514	4874	4580.9984	4832.4207	0.8061092	0.8772816	-0.1221	-0.134077591578	0.918871718	8109	9094	8071.3621	9029.2095	1.2183116	1.4520265	-0.2532	-0.178466788181	0.839042219	6593	6429	6601.899	6369.9504	1.4613729	1.4665414	-0.0051	-0.0612339844734	0.996475720	3110	4048	3183.5919	4007.5931	0.6691824	0.7494362	-0.1634	-0.185184268091	0.8929144!sample_table_end
