Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481852/suppl/GSM481852_MR246.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5950	6033	6069.8787	5868.0662	1.6642387	1.5652964	-0.0884	-0.102441403272	0.9405482	3774	4029	3886.6714	3912.9209	0.9907389	0.9624114	-0.0419	-0.0700681627395	0.97140773	6006	4842	6126.0616	4704.2497	1.7138871	1.3377803	-0.3574	-0.157192829978	0.78055334	6948	7564	7072.6047	7361.9871	2.0228578	2.1282583	0.0733	0.148465469697	1.05210485	12844	13904	12944.481	13599.845	3.4036373	3.628597	0.0923	0.197197219791	1.06609396	7176	8078	7301.4083	7855.6135	2.1575419	2.32715	0.1092	0.0727465509964	1.07861187	3253	3851	3356.0846	3741.9376	0.7279343	0.8001982	0.1365	0.0901042537225	1.09927268	2479	2673	2577.9509	2590.0815	0.6218051	0.6429985	0.0484	0.000998720548724	1.03408379	9662	9760	9781.0945	9516.3858	2.427249	2.2699686	-0.0966	-0.0256928723186	0.935202210	11950	12223	12061.579	11935.299	2.8294285	2.8968239	0.0340	0.0078752023304	1.023819411	23546	22228	23279.076	22039.115	5.4559992	5.4002351	-0.0148	-0.0306174372169	0.989779312	7504	8271	7624.4941	8046.1233	1.5947196	1.7002533	0.0924	0.00233325839615	1.06617713	13013	12931	13110.813	12630.798	3.0797032	2.8472608	-0.1132	-0.134517582586	0.924524414	11902	13215	12013.788	12912.682	2.895629	3.0081931	0.0550	0.068935595705	1.038873815	10008	9554	10128.256	9311.6083	2.1154527	1.9649594	-0.1065	-0.0496576825337	0.9288616	7358	7622	7481.9162	7417.1244	1.5147185	1.5054313	-0.0089	-0.0630659792256	0.993868717	4402	4351	4519.729	4229.5127	1.158997	1.0432251	-0.1518	-0.0839966830337	0.900110218	6497	6903	6621.7488	6716.5651	1.599828	1.5913599	-0.0077	-0.0293041821864	0.994706919	6320	6584	6442.8312	6406.2108	1.7715264	1.6871663	-0.0704	-0.0576667479535	0.9523820	2812	2456	2912.836	2376.1453	0.845784	0.734048	-0.2044	-0.130816293661	0.8678906!sample_table_end
