Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481795/suppl/GSM481795_MR037.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1105	1532	1130.1198	1513.677	0.8016171	0.9615625	-0.2625	-0.182611096124	0.83366092	1110	1269	1135.1376	1253.7184	0.7716289	0.7148959	0.1102	-0.0157207521212	1.07935843	1544	1854	1559.9855	1832.1608	1.0558553	1.1731525	-0.1520	-0.172063305033	0.90001534	6662	8087	6420.9882	8087.7435	4.1074741	5.045753	-0.2968	-0.223408551821	0.81404585	10350	12806	9784.3039	12965.063	7.7248287	9.8303259	-0.3477	-0.323786219818	0.78581616	5713	4706	5549.6201	4669.1547	4.2436673	3.4016925	0.3191	0.266756082645	1.24751657	3168	2007	3143.4577	1981.7675	1.3951907	0.9932896	0.4902	0.344607531899	1.40461638	1610	1943	1626.1267	1918.4736	0.8701416	1.044468	-0.2634	-0.0437688961475	0.83309559	1988	2551	1998.029	2533.0145	1.1894926	1.2501255	-0.0717	-0.0558878566028	0.951498610	8736	8007	8316.8046	8006.7251	3.9801749	4.0912989	-0.0397	-0.0776243342206	0.972838911	11630	9236	10939.21	9266.8355	5.2372078	4.8442615	0.1125	-0.0419228483163	1.081115812	4932	5878	4817.6452	5840.1406	2.1177439	2.7988452	-0.4023	-0.155195700764	0.756649213	3307	3271	3275.9032	3246.1474	1.4362044	1.5345278	-0.0955	-0.0757784845181	0.93592614	4541	6384	4450.4422	6351.4005	3.1933557	3.7259882	-0.2225	-0.240945929868	0.857049315	3431	2912	3394.8485	2892.0334	1.2884403	1.2797797	0.0097	-0.108228496384	1.006767216	2868	2862	2854.3358	2842.5667	1.1965237	1.3375744	-0.1608	-0.143093295204	0.894547417	641	617	664.9707	617.065	0.4331952	0.3448584	0.3290	0.161313069064	1.256153718	3198	4015	3172.0635	3985.6809	2.5377329	2.752868	-0.1174	0.0242532881615	0.921850619	971	1184	995.1145	1171.5863	0.6218826	0.6393552	-0.0400	0.00338837097078	0.972671520	1311	1417	1335.8962	1399.6601	0.5779869	0.6039822	-0.0635	-0.174560921422	0.9569603!sample_table_end
