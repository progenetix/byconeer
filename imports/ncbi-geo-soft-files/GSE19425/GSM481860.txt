Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481860/suppl/GSM481860_MR256.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	8549	5276	7861.1443	5556.0331	1.7357222	1.3667442	-0.3448	-0.193504339136	0.7874212	8220	6624	7564.496	6927.7762	1.849477	1.6787423	-0.1397	-0.097046396197	0.90768483	3830	2320	3566.6781	2496.2242	1.003387	0.7455375	-0.4285	-0.223664963337	0.74302094	13589	9495	12323.636	9795.3954	3.8386755	3.0847726	-0.3154	-0.00982375895985	0.80360335	13489	12685	12234.813	12960.403	3.4605731	3.8201274	0.1426	0.229710592745	1.10390026	6471	7329	5974.4747	7639.1816	1.7612429	2.3470103	0.4142	0.384769869077	1.33258747	2054	2576	1954.6924	2763.0407	0.5501904	0.7100167	0.3679	0.301207169752	1.29049268	2688	2685	2529.9411	2874.1381	0.8031063	0.9237833	0.2020	0.0634677373565	1.15026289	5465	3781	5071.143	4015.6923	1.1673658	0.9460436	-0.3033	-0.322074535866	0.810408810	10679	9395	9768.7893	9695.4491	3.6868245	3.7620654	0.0291	0.0238070554695	1.02040811	12549	7312	11404.741	7622.2112	3.8905453	2.5876486	-0.5883	-0.51228508083	0.66511212	10418	9663	9536.8731	9963.2286	2.9582146	2.4938187	-0.2464	-0.057407487082	0.843014813	4492	4132	4170.7004	4385.4451	1.645732	1.4786824	-0.1544	-0.171362065919	0.898495314	13643	11340	12371.598	11626.597	3.3179931	3.2760145	-0.0184	-0.0257201888731	0.987348215	4056	3343	3768.5032	3564.4509	1.1304377	0.9024487	-0.3250	-0.266759638966	0.798317916	3376	3565	3158.1965	3794.5228	0.9738059	0.9367986	-0.0559	-0.211580805457	0.961997317	820	614	798.60243	695.2722	0.1977127	0.1718861	-0.2020	-0.14469508376	0.869373218	6668	4738	6149.229	5010.9106	1.6990102	1.4892695	-0.1901	-0.276726100185	0.876551219	3546	2627	3314.2783	2815.0497	0.8140278	0.7538957	-0.1107	-0.0758184741957	0.926130120	2429	1690	2295.2102	1837.9201	0.9948266	0.9121156	-0.1252	-0.0994149456375	0.9168589!sample_table_end
