Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9775!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481639/suppl/GSM481639_JA698.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	471	1055	595.2465	989.1027	0.3846382	0.5243404	-0.4470	-0.00621961628595	0.73356592	1275	1402	1436.1963	1302.1823	0.7264681	0.8117716	-0.1602	0.0130765843619	0.89491683	2897	2926	3022.0364	2691.7128	1.2047641	1.365815	-0.1810	-0.0948072278448	0.88208434	3641	7505	3752.0253	6953.6837	2.6116622	3.6415276	-0.4796	-0.352065584874	0.71718865	10847	12556	10317.091	11673.983	5.0839158	7.0525428	-0.4722	-0.485179414645	0.72086286	8417	6006	8159.4206	5521.809	2.5641293	2.1256746	0.2705	0.448678452446	1.20626617	3622	1899	3732.9911	1745.9849	1.1792299	0.657365	0.8431	0.592375131725	1.79387378	2113	2512	2266.7338	2313.7767	0.757341	0.8642057	-0.1904	-0.0406107517244	0.87634349	3076	2484	3190.6679	2289.3112	1.0386406	0.9812746	0.0820	-0.0942720155094	1.058460610	11529	13982	10917.282	13019.656	3.9818844	3.6859765	0.1114	0.0503926161748	1.080279311	3718	7788	3823.6855	7221.852	2.2620985	2.7354431	-0.2741	-0.199457201849	0.826958712	2800	5173	2931.4712	4737.566	1.583238	2.417657	-0.6107	-0.223067262695	0.654864513	1167	2992	1328.3683	2754.5649	0.8411519	1.1109494	-0.4014	-0.181326368202	0.757146914	7651	7498	7464.6046	6947.0818	4.4601945	3.6627317	0.2842	-0.338625859813	1.217723515	870	1438	1029.7834	1334.7666	0.3578503	0.4576884	-0.3550	-0.174440875123	0.781864316	1839	2703	1989.8968	2483.3938	1.5761371	1.5892389	-0.0119	-0.279935305905	0.991755917	580	668	721.7263	629.0934	0.2286432	0.2360937	-0.0463	-0.0809327299979	0.968442418	2353	2238	2494.5679	2057.7821	1.171918	1.2133911	-0.0502	0.172616417818	0.965820419	1115	1310	1274.7636	1219.1322	0.4193449	0.4913101	-0.2285	-0.15694198	0.853523820	2127	2258	2280.2283	2077.985	0.8645904	0.9896551	-0.1949	-0.221683061505	0.8736279!sample_table_end
