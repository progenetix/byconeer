Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481725/suppl/GSM481725_JBH367.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2988	3055	2941.1012	3092.7756	0.9317633	0.9204748	0.0176	-0.155144388605	1.01226372	3548	4446	3491.0274	4477.8509	1.1465517	1.4374399	-0.3262	-0.201506808612	0.79763453	3117	3840	3065.4636	3879.9349	0.9409602	1.0875844	-0.2089	-0.182545733926	0.86518364	11967	15216	11439.01	15269.863	3.5921873	4.5359275	-0.3365	-0.332956115485	0.7919415	18664	20143	17213.47	20259.458	5.435846	5.8200791	-0.0985	-0.17321686899	0.93398146	9104	9789	8813.4392	9810.5686	2.817688	2.9628066	-0.0725	-0.244899892314	0.95101997	3687	4398	3625.9111	4428.6293	1.0536151	1.2114405	-0.2014	-0.294897842265	0.86972088	2643	3091	2610.8601	3129.2293	0.7888198	0.9211657	-0.2238	-0.367616243216	0.85632779	2343	2788	2319.2444	2823.8152	0.663766	0.8122459	-0.2912	-0.186659379959	0.817198410	8837	8298	8562.5627	8298.9778	2.5346409	2.544763	-0.0058	-0.104111608286	0.996022311	13095	13208	12442.295	13235.259	3.7731018	4.0202297	-0.0915	-0.22865547231	0.938528912	9676	14105	9349.5151	14151.436	2.7626753	4.1344283	-0.5816	-0.25167029869	0.668212113	5778	4490	5663.817	4522.9802	1.3609697	1.2937513	0.0731	-0.106575826524	1.051956214	12248	13553	11687.953	13586.518	3.2719461	3.987827	-0.2855	-0.319757732814	0.820483415	3074	2863	3024.0026	2899.0929	0.8680734	0.7977112	0.1220	-0.0190790660343	1.088205116	2952	3630	2906.6714	3673.5641	0.7957984	0.9920036	-0.3179	-0.23679375753	0.802213217	1198	1027	1210.575	1074.3752	0.3967578	0.3462486	0.1965	-0.0293541087047	1.145875418	4097	5655	4009.6919	5679.5462	1.0292077	1.5165088	-0.5592	-0.426674863435	0.678669119	2089	1997	2074.9156	2035.5148	0.6826575	0.6611677	0.0461	-0.0933122269459	1.032502720	2134	2047	2116.7095	2084.9495	0.5443436	0.6066497	-0.1563	-0.0248562816706	0.8972946!sample_table_end
