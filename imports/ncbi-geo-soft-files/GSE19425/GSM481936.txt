Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481936/suppl/GSM481936_MR362.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	7099	5267	7173.2885	5101.7662	1.6427335	1.2094311	-0.4418	0.0622408260637	0.73623092	4418	4044	4483.3845	3943.144	1.1033995	1.0353385	-0.0919	0.00957334159175	0.9383173	4387	3549	4453.1212	3470.7776	1.209953	0.8738728	-0.4695	0.00840513536441	0.7222374	8050	8801	8105.8664	8538.1326	2.3467096	2.2894162	-0.0357	-0.0948518314168	0.97558565	20874	18915	20379.039	18911.917	4.5656192	4.1106468	-0.1514	-0.18258439092	0.90034826	8160	10966	8214.6839	10695.112	2.3284308	2.8269841	0.2799	0.0257806432156	1.21411567	3980	4495	4059.2132	4375.3732	0.9650162	1.0432971	0.1125	0.0039523265722	1.08111878	3161	3674	3231.2878	3586.1774	0.7679355	0.8690376	0.1784	0.00393880227645	1.13165439	8111	6929	8166.2166	6708.1344	1.8679993	1.6569088	-0.1730	0.0370331213734	0.886996510	8850	8401	8892.0904	8143.0804	2.8201232	2.5759955	-0.1306	-0.0919771754533	0.913433711	22537	20300	21940.404	20363.323	7.3447304	6.6081031	-0.1525	-0.0149060151915	0.899706712	6750	9502	6828.4347	9231.7288	2.1147389	2.6267544	0.3128	-0.135079804709	1.242117613	5982	6053	6060.7221	5861.6621	2.2612411	2.0300072	-0.1556	-0.0847111116789	0.897740314	15679	14295	15453.647	14115.663	3.3469248	3.1208421	-0.1009	-0.132444921995	0.932450615	5053	4970	5128.7577	4824.7075	1.4459569	1.2669472	-0.1907	-0.0181344026893	0.876199916	4186	4094	4258.959	3991.8091	1.1369012	1.0045762	-0.1785	-0.0821740980284	0.883609117	3057	2568	3128.1283	2533.2645	0.7837504	0.667359	-0.2319	0.060572332276	0.851494318	8015	7895	8071.2313	7643.5614	1.7225721	1.5829976	-0.1219	0.00935949925811	0.918973219	4859	3901	4933.5859	3803.7001	1.2455831	1.0531367	-0.2421	-0.0260166801919	0.845496920	1718	1289	1780.519	1293.4781	0.6144381	0.4452441	-0.4647	-0.0582285195558	0.7246363!sample_table_end
