Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481604/suppl/GSM481604_EL670.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2067	2027	2049.7918	2046.6587	0.7193723	0.7039118	-0.0313	0.0341283620171	0.97850822	1678	1157	1658.9117	1194.6243	0.8128231	0.5136259	-0.6622	-0.468952272664	0.63190373	1781	1504	1764.0163	1535.4787	0.5823472	0.5195715	-0.1646	-0.114249649281	0.89220224	19397	11044	18380.893	10933.839	5.7052395	3.6832171	-0.6313	-0.489760581047	0.6455855	16794	15633	16036.519	15591.689	6.4491509	6.350952	-0.0221	-0.612232833334	0.98477336	9693	7077	9452.8884	6989.7931	3.692274	2.7588638	-0.4204	-0.450011209784	0.7471997	2017	1847	1999.8982	1870.1954	1.0631079	0.9597141	-0.1476	-0.543308577179	0.90274388	2287	1657	2269.5988	1684.2694	0.755821	0.6035194	-0.3246	-0.460677322934	0.79849519	3136	2221	3105.8814	2234.169	1.5657669	0.9923009	-0.6580	-0.45529204935	0.633747510	11967	11043	11614.451	10932.817	4.9352919	4.7175045	-0.0651	-0.155725540444	0.955871411	8568	5844	8375.4259	5796.8202	3.3267152	2.3961977	-0.4734	-0.381289777687	0.720289412	9142	5277	8923.165	5241.3776	3.507332	2.1101632	-0.7330	-0.550780486231	0.601643413	995	1126	981.3497	1165.0816	0.4935751	0.5463231	0.1465	0.0893550945673	1.106869314	4110	4508	4055.3748	4478.1157	2.7355825	2.3291832	-0.2320	-0.285061522026	0.851439515	1610	1616	1590.7398	1644.3012	0.5572478	0.5976482	0.1010	0.055634922021	1.072499816	948	1197	934.5771	1233.343	0.3998013	0.5297104	0.4059	-0.0358618860344	1.324934217	369	270	322.7159	323.0274	0.1429552	0.1291258	-0.1468	-0.04525408841	0.90326118	4021	3430	3969.0368	3427.1765	1.9004662	1.5107496	-0.3311	-0.269030571247	0.794936319	1208	1043	1192.2649	1085.1467	0.4780331	0.4209681	-0.1834	-0.0562956020945	0.880625520	2062	1574	2044.8023	1603.5494	0.7918222	0.634042	-0.3206	-0.121307235746	0.8007378!sample_table_end
