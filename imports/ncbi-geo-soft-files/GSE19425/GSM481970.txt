Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481970/suppl/GSM481970_MR454.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3532	4246	3843.7466	3897.2942	1.0509347	1.0862126	0.0476	0.194103320177	1.03356812	3890	3560	4205.1798	3278.4316	1.4932971	1.1895096	-0.3281	-0.334594184725	0.79656593	2195	1835	2407.2541	1706.6838	0.676278	0.5041481	-0.4238	-0.26133598046	0.74547474	13653	9258	12735.388	8680.5819	4.0735596	2.7999028	-0.5409	-0.411942835147	0.68733565	19520	13196	17397.967	12577.14	4.5499812	3.3631665	-0.4360	-0.33794609841	0.73916056	10957	10130	10573.938	9526.4741	3.0077953	2.8036235	-0.1014	-0.0267540894102	0.93211917	2943	2519	3229.0698	2322.1747	0.7727166	0.5644048	-0.4532	-0.493210632347	0.73041648	2731	3208	2998.1613	2947.4119	0.9285139	0.9555232	0.0414	0.057354609233	1.02908879	4036	5425	4355.4607	4998.2676	1.5991809	1.9263571	0.2685	0.0881019663198	1.204589810	10235	9610	9989.9737	9021.6265	3.6418177	3.507796	-0.0541	0.0669572680075	0.963199211	10465	9060	10178.258	8487.417	3.1065041	2.7562354	-0.1726	-0.119965540554	0.887246612	10841	7347	10480.96	6815.0524	3.0932583	2.0295005	-0.6080	-0.571562216494	0.656104413	1014	1068	1102.7368	1013.7833	0.4423362	0.42488	-0.0581	0.00811006673167	0.960536314	10890	9438	10520.256	8854.9234	2.9117568	2.4776185	-0.2329	-0.242413427049	0.850901615	1095	1392	1193.0218	1306.827	0.3436732	0.392255	0.1908	0.181724922699	1.141360316	1382	1942	1512.5919	1806.4034	0.4062353	0.4932381	0.2800	0.0499743251988	1.214168517	550	613	579.6378	599.0547	0.1942278	0.2090225	0.1059	0.114783180778	1.076171918	5324	6409	5662.9259	5931.6399	1.4251029	1.4020774	-0.0235	-0.010654422213	0.983842919	948	1077	1030.1065	1021.8758	0.3757804	0.3888377	0.0493	0.125694871122	1.034747320	1403	1651	1535.71	1541.1738	0.7403741	0.7954367	0.1035	0.109016411353	1.0743713!sample_table_end
