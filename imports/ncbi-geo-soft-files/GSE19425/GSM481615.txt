Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481615/suppl/GSM481615_EL685.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3168	1753	2793.6037	2047.3253	1.2041221	0.9028948	0.4154	0.102360357938	1.33362412	2789	1900	2429.3365	2191.3606	1.3504893	1.2037474	0.1659	0.211896484554	1.12190433	2058	1236	1720.3221	1531.2766	0.6439976	0.581391	0.1475	0.0215547740281	1.10768414	20589	14673	19219.228	14504.889	7.749176	5.8545927	0.4045	0.116950366685	1.32360645	11020	14724	10326.166	14553.427	4.5989875	6.5946915	-0.5200	0.0525497232985	0.69737726	15744	11620	14754.427	11591.037	6.2758065	5.1926968	0.2733	0.197946139767	1.20858337	1906	1520	1564.8012	1813.4561	1.0239336	1.1087009	-0.1147	0.00553695642099	0.92354368	2570	1641	2217.6759	1933.8025	0.9312418	0.8665189	0.1039	0.161057095767	1.07469319	3747	2738	3374.2329	3018.2834	1.815096	1.5698063	0.2095	0.199556767576	1.156254810	16534	11878	15500.155	11835.339	7.9735513	6.2913138	0.3419	0.2242438182	1.267390511	1712	3008	1359.7303	3293.2191	0.6595098	1.6121068	-1.2895	-1.38057643394	0.409098112	7123	4845	6614.0489	5083.5147	3.6842299	2.7585946	0.4174	0.0182316445254	1.33554613	1303	652	949.8451	917.2649	0.5862048	0.544938	0.1053	-0.0414618314162	1.075727514	2550	2326	2198.2187	2611.4689	1.5595911	1.5548442	0.0044	-0.0502771870972	1.00305315	1750	769	1400.1254	1036.2085	0.6636198	0.4905368	0.4360	0.109159671449	1.352844116	1426	853	1064.5656	1121.554	0.6163371	0.6162343	0.0002	0.116543485421	1.000166917	948	241	605.2078	462.662	0.3371757	0.2540652	0.4083	0.255942991122	1.327122618	4680	3372	4276.1052	3657.299	2.3663447	1.8307999	0.3702	0.151031009926	1.292519619	1630	879	1272.3776	1148.7971	0.7520335	0.6348849	0.2443	-0.14770072995	1.184519520	3785	2007	3411.036	2294.9717	1.4228717	1.018203	0.4828	0.0856926381412	1.3974342!sample_table_end
