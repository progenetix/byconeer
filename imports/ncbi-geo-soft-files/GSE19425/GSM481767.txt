Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481767/suppl/GSM481767_JBH539.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1819	1288	1936.7398	1177.8263	1.5617735	0.9066946	0.7845	0.549612496708	1.7224912	1488	1246	1599.0947	1140.702	1.3037801	1.0245878	0.3477	0.497691044318	1.27249233	1312	1075	1418.013	984.283	1.0478582	0.7382518	0.5053	0.209405326983	1.41937774	10146	5653	9379.6921	5117.7547	6.3201263	3.7909113	0.7374	0.375534382035	1.66717865	16314	11014	14271.284	10096.431	12.969237	9.2900149	0.4813	0.529462064292	1.39604056	5332	4622	5262.795	4163.6662	4.2853885	3.4875569	0.2972	0.407722012054	1.22876517	1087	1191	1181.8978	1090.204	1.4948304	1.2920074	0.2104	0.306033187145	1.15698288	1790	1338	1907.2518	1220.2227	1.198142	0.8871677	0.4335	0.515983770568	1.35052489	2135	1407	2251.2172	1279.8908	1.7854148	1.0280324	0.7964	0.514773794479	1.7367310	6181	4773	6017.3262	4304.2911	3.7724916	3.1408807	0.2643	0.181419113618	1.201093511	10632	6539	9776.1519	5934.3162	6.0795792	4.4064817	0.4643	0.279059258973	1.3796912	3939	2312	3976.0341	2086.9249	4.1101384	2.3209169	0.8245	0.382136663911	1.770911413	1397	978	1503.114	899.1924	1.4095051	0.9005171	0.6464	0.371808852336	1.565217414	6262	5232	6088.4075	4729.3411	7.4391313	4.2536746	0.8064	0.727529382211	1.748871715	975	923	1061.3531	851.2587	0.8959861	0.8078051	0.1495	0.18450539442	1.109161216	791	950	873.62873	874.8084	0.9150553	0.9560145	-0.0632	0.184898505166	0.957156317	372	283	399.43375	307.3303	0.3283316	0.2841753	0.2084	0.318355949049	1.15538418	1823	2207	1940.8057	1993.5504	1.9070555	1.631993	0.2247	0.162671263997	1.168543919	732	647	807.76185	615.1217	0.6722041	0.4994277	0.4286	0.350019664274	1.345948520	1716	1056	1832.3311	968.0186	1.0945061	0.6183435	0.8238	0.565131929174	1.7700614!sample_table_end
