Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481642/suppl/GSM481642_JA796.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1299	1595	1510.0775	1277.19	1.2878887	0.9390557	-0.4557	-0.0652748746974	0.72914352	669	1641	851.2026	1310.9494	1.0073616	1.0641406	0.0791	-0.226028614324	1.0563643	1222	1261	1433.9149	1042.5792	0.978127	0.7698473	-0.3454	-0.15435894919	0.78706274	4945	4458	4655.3269	3468.8418	2.5950352	2.5158565	-0.0447	-0.172134501031	0.96948835	12757	7261	10428.267	5822.234	8.2062599	4.4732046	-0.8754	-0.491051259652	0.54509666	4180	5992	4027.9084	4746.9412	3.0030396	3.624638	0.2714	0.130708058346	1.20698977	1570	1797	1778.8014	1420.8375	1.741819	1.0913921	-0.6744	-0.0221504096316	0.62658188	1939	1693	2130.9666	1348.9822	1.0353978	1.0171369	-0.0257	0.19457034966	0.98236349	961	2037	1174.4115	1586.9327	1.3285906	1.2322205	-0.1086	0.0160495358559	0.927464410	2337	2742	2504.9906	2120.7709	1.7135775	2.0102576	0.2304	-0.0660982382128	1.173134911	10863	5739	9089.8003	4534.3474	5.5188529	4.1403594	-0.4146	-0.104928228342	0.75022112	2465	2494	2620.0141	1932.6945	1.9377518	1.6048152	-0.2720	-0.288857603331	0.828184113	1158	1671	1372.4959	1332.9247	1.3845266	1.3989394	0.0149	-0.228859441571	1.010409914	2566	4718	2708.0809	3683.738	3.8665847	3.2777433	-0.2384	-0.234985328605	0.847710215	2223	2749	2399.1592	2125.7886	1.4966372	1.8010555	0.2671	-0.00390915201937	1.203401516	801	1317	999.5277	1084.6222	0.7525117	0.8170165	0.1187	-0.0296458990499	1.085719317	627	826	798.7978	747.2888	0.8971153	0.6046875	-0.5691	-0.118228770043	0.674035418	1233	2284	1444.3435	1768.2389	1.4201337	1.3125637	-0.1136	-0.238839033577	0.924253619	593	1151	755.788	963.3526	0.8161812	0.7768332	-0.0713	0.0653722642317	0.951790220	784	547	980.5396	540.9794	0.5625201	0.4208817	-0.4185	-0.315881321103	0.7482074!sample_table_end
