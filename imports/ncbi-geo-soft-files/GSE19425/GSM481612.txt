Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481612/suppl/GSM481612_EL678.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2868	2569	2854.5659	2569.6753	0.9382198	0.8738355	-0.1026	0.134956756598	0.93137612	1623	1560	1599.3388	1592.5468	0.7765813	0.7545566	-0.0415	0.168211087994	0.97163883	2138	1658	2118.5544	1688.8156	0.7032488	0.5751787	-0.2900	-0.0824957736807	0.81788794	21986	17145	21212.847	16952.177	6.7025767	5.5329388	-0.2767	0.00530009157644	0.82549425	16781	24058	16369.007	23966.118	7.1835301	10.490025	0.5463	-0.0543826189591	1.46028836	11741	10720	11585.787	10524.711	4.4974477	4.154841	-0.1143	-0.0925058762646	0.92382197	1465	1693	1437.4494	1723.2252	1.0648973	1.1355388	0.0927	-0.197976052659	1.06633648	2004	2086	1981.212	2102.4405	0.7038606	0.7458091	0.0835	0.0305592638645	1.05959769	3353	3010	3345.4307	2996.8006	1.7899448	1.5674044	-0.1915	-0.0517724476821	0.875671910	13480	13154	13244.792	12939.247	6.2465408	5.9189219	-0.0777	-0.0601795078003	0.947551911	8325	6350	8265.1964	6242.3197	3.6986629	2.7184569	-0.4442	-0.321572766793	0.734983712	7671	6795	7623.607	6679.7264	3.7324762	3.0835583	-0.2755	-0.101767372489	0.826142713	1029	1077	1003.5713	1115.5525	0.671551	0.6766552	0.0109	0.141483670211	1.007600514	3734	3835	3731.4499	3795.4421	2.4796046	2.4145245	-0.0384	-0.0312675619304	0.973753815	1319	1283	1292.1897	1319.5861	0.5455764	0.5331344	-0.0333	-0.00332307597926	0.977194616	1041	1190	1015.6054	1227.8236	0.5524028	0.6145411	0.1538	0.196671875792	1.112487217	398	317	362.6272	361.8142	0.155738	0.1522346	-0.0328	-0.0230725658344	0.977504518	5138	4614	5117.945	4555.3341	2.5924329	2.2903436	-0.1787	-0.0417564375627	0.883472619	1290	1198	1263.4593	1235.7359	0.4990028	0.4842601	-0.0433	-0.00302904292134	0.970455620	2571	1849	2550.4744	1875.4107	0.9773111	0.7363213	-0.4085	-0.121387363787	0.7534155!sample_table_end
