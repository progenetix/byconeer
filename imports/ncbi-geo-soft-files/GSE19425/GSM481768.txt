Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481768/suppl/GSM481768_JBH540.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1328	1834	1262.6655	1824.6428	1.0697442	1.3305238	0.3147	0.549612496708	1.24377752	712	1033	570.4982	1101.4981	0.4794723	0.7511873	0.6477	0.497691044318	1.56669593	1455	1280	1400.2035	1324.3908	1.065198	1.0032447	-0.0864	0.209405326983	0.94183874	7520	7725	7247.1658	7141.4393	4.8890186	4.9355297	0.0137	0.375534382035	1.00951335	8207	13049	7873.1261	11819.334	6.8461327	10.216807	0.5776	0.529462064292	1.49234736	3204	4911	3183.3339	4617.3107	2.6801507	3.8385165	0.5182	0.407722012054	1.43220177	920	1121	820.0129	1179.229	1.0016733	1.323273	0.4017	0.306033187145	1.32106258	1561	2148	1511.7468	2099.8907	0.7740738	1.1720144	0.5984	0.515983770568	1.5140869	1800	2643	1775.35	2547.431	1.4144053	1.6625175	0.2332	0.514773794479	1.17541810	7350	7266	7092.4018	6734.4728	3.6413894	3.898661	0.0985	0.181419113618	1.07065211	8439	7903	8087.5507	7299.3057	4.1214497	4.3982395	0.0938	0.279059258973	1.067158312	4595	4435	4523.9335	4179.9026	4.0252735	3.8607149	-0.0602	0.382136663911	0.959118613	1847	1934	1823.5425	1911.6139	1.275034	1.3639497	0.0973	0.371808852336	1.069735914	2745	6682	2727.5903	6212.1212	3.5211111	5.5199874	0.6486	0.727529382211	1.567683415	1538	1485	1487.4416	1502.9033	0.8654876	1.0077424	0.2195	0.18450539442	1.164363616	947	1130	850.8695	1187.3613	0.8803943	1.1885414	0.4330	0.184898505166	1.350010217	592	570	436.3924	694.7698	0.356856	0.4802154	0.4283	0.318355949049	1.345683818	1716	2098	1683.2425	2054.7641	1.8255157	1.9573945	0.1006	0.162671263997	1.072241919	1001	1146	908.1019	1202.1426	0.6845547	0.8262521	0.2714	0.350019664274	1.20699220	1608	1763	1563.2559	1761.1327	0.8033972	0.99354	0.3065	0.565131929174	1.2366734!sample_table_end
