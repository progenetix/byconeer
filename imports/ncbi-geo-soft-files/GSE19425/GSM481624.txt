Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481624/suppl/GSM481624_EL694.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2458	3037	2567.614	2849.1128	0.8505837	0.9834246	0.2094	0.132823181968	1.15617622	3670	3609	3760.0132	3403.2604	1.3520459	1.1996582	-0.1725	-0.0805842624397	0.8872913	1423	1901	1541.7625	1801.2383	0.5258426	0.6412726	0.2863	0.202348131999	1.21951434	12196	8036	11838.624	7574.1546	3.5837103	2.7069933	-0.4048	-0.0185403538405	0.75536055	11464	18817	11157.584	18090.057	5.0694197	7.4800247	0.5612	-0.0429522591337	1.47551896	10544	9621	10312.998	9103.0992	3.7463981	3.4458018	-0.1207	-0.0597567840071	0.91976397	991	2122	1109.4933	2002.1968	0.7508372	0.977737	0.3809	0.157819839479	1.30219578	2514	2178	2625.274	2055.4942	0.758044	0.6873221	-0.1413	-0.13798240485	0.90670489	8201	7797	8121.5665	7345.8706	2.8117786	2.477542	-0.1826	-0.0661174950596	0.881129810	10715	12668	10468.593	12038.01	3.4797636	4.4889005	0.3674	0.184528372197	1.290001611	14975	11916	14396.719	11313.475	4.7384609	4.3345595	-0.1285	-0.476868899522	0.914761112	4418	4594	4486.1988	4326.3827	1.6462437	1.61783	-0.0251	0.16076210247	0.982740313	1152	2181	1266.2138	2058.475	0.5273477	0.8844959	0.7461	0.28436689503	1.677253514	3425	5209	3521.6272	4896.7847	1.8961692	2.2057119	0.2182	0.0714570765981	1.163246415	1259	1861	1375.2776	1764.5513	0.4905823	0.6417255	0.3875	0.264203356687	1.308089216	991	2153	1109.4933	2030.6579	0.4472654	0.735701	0.7180	0.24763226227	1.644886917	649	950	753.5324	916.4334	0.2644552	0.3137971	0.2468	-0.0968434028866	1.186579418	3926	4698	4004.9378	4424.7117	1.6744263	1.6895521	0.0130	0.0439158697562	1.009033419	825	1452	941.1528	1386.8402	0.3509468	0.5198411	0.5668	0.418035764327	1.481253220	1835	1616	1941.8008	1537.5624	0.6715435	0.6073201	-0.1450	0.00636208639719	0.9043646!sample_table_end
