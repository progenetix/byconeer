Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481533/suppl/GSM481533_EL153.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2658	2022	2474.9603	2159.7098	1.0917221	0.9175028	0.2508	-0.0789262166286	1.18988412	1631	1715	1549.0129	1830.2555	0.6633815	0.7636382	-0.2031	-0.293804549675	0.86871183	3352	2803	3120.6077	2979.0326	1.31926	1.1918419	0.1465	-0.0822654918312	1.10690854	9940	12155	9251.6474	12244.536	4.243215	5.5060991	-0.3759	-0.276933799351	0.7706395	10817	16014	10060.35	16052.019	4.5958316	7.0824122	-0.6239	-0.216000717769	0.64890766	6625	5634	6176.6413	5826.0998	2.8530381	2.6342395	0.1151	0.00179791994574	1.08305957	1143	1551	1120.6537	1650.5015	0.5358826	0.7594911	-0.5031	-0.212895263413	0.70558128	2152	2032	2016.892	2170.279	0.9015256	0.9702672	-0.1060	-0.0809521706162	0.92915199	4258	3394	3954.8791	3587.8775	1.6043794	1.3957202	0.2010	0.0211816343994	1.149499310	5595	4830	5222.0787	5028.7097	2.3120552	2.2673401	0.0282	0.0683783214557	1.019721311	11575	11840	10758.465	11937.371	4.8716162	5.499995	-0.1750	-0.235425712283	0.885749212	3809	4546	3539.7726	4750.8859	1.6744278	2.2313707	-0.4143	-0.53315530324	0.750403213	2587	2258	2410.8174	2406.5827	0.9822928	0.993531	-0.0164	-0.0965946377086	0.988688614	8398	8067	7816.5444	8221.8788	3.355722	3.409333	-0.0229	-0.280106731031	0.984275215	1857	1696	1750.2903	1809.7494	0.7907224	0.8029552	-0.0221	-0.0452360756594	0.984765216	1938	3079	1822.7523	3259.5394	0.8275276	1.4552469	-0.8144	-0.301606950677	0.568650917	1104	960	1086.2344	995.6247	0.4841789	0.4309564	0.1680	-0.0818871249103	1.123498518	2907	2768	2704.211	2943.4821	1.0898513	1.1745143	-0.1079	-0.263624571487	0.927916519	2073	1555	1945.316	1654.846	0.889405	0.7407208	0.2639	0.0108618874631	1.20072920	2469	1955	2303.9188	2088.8274	0.9296483	0.8499853	0.1292	-0.110096773566	1.0937228!sample_table_end
