Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9775!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481627/suppl/GSM481627_JA684.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	682	1199	812.71021	1087.9247	0.5951549	0.7710737	-0.3736	-0.119997461102	0.7718522	1205	1448	1338.6036	1314.5442	0.8011953	0.8421721	-0.0720	0.132437995098	0.95134393	2561	2434	2700.6647	2245.8178	1.2896046	1.2555627	0.0386	-0.016824574622	1.02711294	3238	4396	3366.1046	4120.9232	3.2803167	3.5563466	-0.1166	-0.0553572476032	0.92238385	9037	9463	8739.7333	9104.1757	5.0449494	5.6657309	-0.1674	-0.223830925734	0.89043226	5702	5758	5685.2851	5439.2297	2.2773766	2.3986911	-0.0749	-0.00567790583335	0.94942477	1711	1775	1851.761	1618.8588	0.7224784	0.6798051	0.0878	0.00206028365764	1.06277278	2248	2669	2389.2224	2460.2804	0.8537817	0.9614565	-0.1714	0.0480846528581	0.88800869	1785	2137	1922.3993	1965.5325	0.879519	1.0164833	-0.2088	-0.293980337046	0.865256610	6391	8669	6311.5849	8307.728	3.787485	3.7146065	0.0280	0.0440728784749	1.019619411	2845	3973	2984.9634	3698.1733	3.1471609	2.8274427	0.1546	0.00567190025031	1.113076712	4585	5175	4663.5252	4873.8252	2.5573978	2.7881463	-0.1246	-0.0843150180322	0.917239413	820	1688	953.45766	1537.9781	1.1378258	1.3115066	-0.2049	-0.107240157629	0.867571514	4585	4151	4663.5252	3876.5026	2.9780992	2.5150189	0.2438	-0.258116645562	1.184125915	1463	2006	1600.1168	1838.901	0.6581111	0.7717976	-0.2299	0.0559771916099	0.852699116	1786	2275	1923.352	2097.6809	1.4981217	1.6176978	-0.1108	-0.142511077639	0.926082517	1019	991	1154.8077	891.72481	0.4148433	0.3638211	0.1893	0.125232249372	1.140239718	2398	2547	2541.0871	2348.9955	1.3258186	1.3838356	-0.0618	0.0685764391592	0.958075219	1522	1652	1659.9411	1504.0353	0.6780396	0.7206158	-0.0879	-0.00378807588545	0.940916920	1783	2021	1920.4954	1853.6101	0.8999377	0.9915805	-0.1399	-0.141374556666	0.907579!sample_table_end
