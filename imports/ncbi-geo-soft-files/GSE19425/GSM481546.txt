Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481546/suppl/GSM481546_EL168.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3298	3726	3371.7689	3624.6872	1.0947898	1.1147084	0.0260	0.11077400883	1.0181942	5801	4145	5691.426	4066.6216	1.7759289	1.3035434	-0.4461	-0.328665082123	0.73400653	3721	3506	3775.7447	3405.1759	1.1656824	1.0537118	-0.1457	-0.104153879768	0.90394424	12574	8732	11740.145	8788.3184	3.5462326	2.8067637	-0.3374	-0.150082526252	0.79147765	15267	11723	14211.485	11824.587	5.0658796	3.9649092	-0.3535	-0.133459848196	0.78266946	7296	7489	7023.3031	7519.9223	2.4048301	2.5051627	0.0590	0.0755346848243	1.04172127	1907	2246	2021.0568	2147.8029	0.8025988	0.7410714	-0.1151	0.007856262301	0.92333978	2535	2422	2635.8921	2318.3809	0.7851228	0.7293025	-0.1064	-0.0954267939854	0.92890239	4811	4097	4792.4601	4015.2634	1.398737	1.2340665	-0.1807	-0.142127069763	0.882271910	11955	11830	11174.462	11928.358	3.6956358	4.1492521	0.1670	-0.00853619576206	1.122743711	17793	15410	16557.601	15451.937	5.3262731	5.2927817	-0.0091	-0.0106995651785	0.99371212	9771	8238	9203.8796	8289.4779	3.3260541	2.8994329	-0.1980	-0.0948786866678	0.871733513	4353	4659	4363.7261	4599.8841	1.8423097	1.8136462	-0.0226	-0.0809284878884	0.984441514	10928	8987	10243.892	9047.138	3.9510855	2.939556	-0.4267	-0.154109249616	0.743986915	3827	3999	3876.4028	3910.6229	1.2466405	1.2834246	0.0420	-0.118729632857	1.029506616	3326	4343	3398.7164	4276.6884	1.2166139	1.4461775	0.2494	-0.0243929527817	1.188690517	1101	1352	1215.9629	1284.8469	0.4024333	0.4077334	0.0189	0.0814658918327	1.0131718	3728	5218	3782.4121	5171.4336	1.5588882	1.7013715	0.1262	-0.0300987798194	1.091400619	2725	3182	2818.6978	3076.8805	0.9059455	1.0223009	0.1743	0.0484707091782	1.128435220	2737	2188	2830.2157	2092.1379	0.8270947	0.7132927	-0.2136	-0.203652500909	0.8624075!sample_table_end
