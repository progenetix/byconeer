Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481927/suppl/GSM481927_MR351.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3985	3625	3907.0666	3673.3749	1.0815305	1.0423632	0.0532	0.0749066772169	1.03757552	4633	4501	4520.5739	4581.8853	1.2536197	1.307798	-0.0610	-0.0410570391343	0.9585733	6811	4532	6575.847	4614.4097	1.6089028	1.1284847	0.5117	0.0955303332598	1.42571964	8904	8888	8536.3332	9111.5327	2.3580716	2.4842577	-0.0752	-0.201215592183	0.94920575	21172	19579	19972.812	20206.858	5.0341576	4.9569789	0.0223	-0.155313513574	1.01556976	10590	9518	10103.752	9765.5572	2.5680194	2.5051014	0.0358	-0.0240477394846	1.0251167	3626	3561	3561.8785	3607.2071	1.1517334	1.1443887	0.0092	-0.0192468873901	1.00641818	2836	2897	2811.9372	2932.5687	0.8376591	0.8907332	-0.0886	-0.00246258808311	0.94041539	6439	6105	6223.7675	6236.8511	1.6401115	1.704288	-0.0554	0.0238937588561	0.962344110	8395	7636	8057.1267	7806.9564	3.1090891	3.0787054	0.0142	-0.0821376276525	1.00986911	11534	10875	10980.36	11198.936	4.0099732	4.1751427	-0.0582	-0.0935304711753	0.960439812	5794	5620	5614.7749	5734.0955	2.0319749	2.0254305	0.0047	-0.200057164162	1.003231113	4223	3748	4129.6847	3801.546	2.0652668	1.7919449	0.2048	0.0864968287652	1.152528114	14100	13059	13369.566	13484.117	3.5440485	3.6060206	-0.0250	-0.129004653251	0.982814315	3972	3790	3894.9422	3845.3378	1.3306832	1.2908959	0.0438	0.0260678695846	1.030821516	3882	3911	3809.2978	3970.3012	1.2566653	1.2812977	-0.0280	0.00363475991253	0.980775417	3258	2582	3211.2734	2609.6241	0.9226978	0.7905748	0.2230	0.150233538646	1.167122818	6596	6226	6372.2046	6360.7112	1.6283539	1.5742163	0.0488	0.0261150502933	1.034390219	4173	3649	4082.5223	3698.3744	1.2449102	1.1929622	0.0615	0.0212225778609	1.043545420	4019	3373	3938.773	3414.9354	1.1596819	1.0594578	0.1304	-0.0133911460262	1.0945994!sample_table_end
