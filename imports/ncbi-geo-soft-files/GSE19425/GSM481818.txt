Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481818/suppl/GSM481818_MR070.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4765	5592	4830.8909	5554.5549	1.0475674	1.1699381	0.1594	0.182730684133	1.1168142	5030	5314	5074.2972	5258.4554	1.1723033	1.0965321	-0.0964	-0.0962686467109	0.93536553	4378	3357	4469.6507	3266.2327	0.9821851	0.7405914	-0.4073	-0.222297271523	0.75402424	15019	11763	13775.307	12219.945	3.2633657	2.8590718	-0.1908	-0.0688177944228	0.87611135	18933	11663	17307.511	12111.096	3.703925	2.6858529	-0.4637	-0.309953819758	0.72513696	11457	10749	10669.714	11123.777	2.5142577	2.6615699	0.0821	0.196986425522	1.05859077	4163	4313	4267.55	4209.421	0.8418289	0.7809092	-0.1084	-0.130689692223	0.9276348	2916	3282	3041.5906	3192.2171	0.6817652	0.7345853	0.1077	0.0152757529678	1.07747549	5986	7241	5952.5277	7337.9586	1.3224787	1.4669986	0.1496	0.132962387178	1.109279510	15726	12238	14417.7	12730.725	3.0504135	2.8952429	-0.0753	-0.130554747165	0.949131211	20641	17142	18826.638	17807.508	3.8663514	4.0028077	0.0500	0.0222051566401	1.035293212	10940	10349	10230.01	10689.962	2.0415395	2.1292556	0.0607	0.0171860527609	1.042965613	5901	6903	5876.1135	6963.4323	1.2971293	1.4170811	0.1276	-0.0810763281844	1.092474714	13098	11168	12089.759	11574.136	2.4761049	2.3095548	-0.1005	-0.0905601114618	0.93273715	5865	6240	5843.7174	6248.7702	1.1113916	1.2272814	0.1431	0.101057010584	1.104274416	5016	6041	5061.4654	6036.9382	0.9944993	1.1649382	0.2282	-0.0287162658283	1.171381517	1991	2257	2093.3274	2228.5575	0.4796107	0.4676835	-0.0363	-0.0788840074293	0.975131418	7818	9738	7555.9522	10031.34	1.4753946	1.9899116	0.4316	0.237867398745	1.348731819	3698	4233	3820.6054	4128.4049	0.9266452	0.9019084	-0.0390	-0.149023720583	0.973304920	3123	2766	3252.8535	2699.3271	0.7481405	0.6920313	-0.1125	-0.0992279537562	0.9250018!sample_table_end
