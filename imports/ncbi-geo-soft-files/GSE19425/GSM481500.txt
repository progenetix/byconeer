Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481500/suppl/GSM481500_DE407.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3336	2258	2408.6411	3051.5271	1.1555884	1.4709275	0.3481	0.0836342503662	1.27288182	3124	1466	2274.9068	1941.487	1.5139888	1.0320282	-0.5529	-0.0139949769917	0.68166183	4197	2284	2953.3052	3088.0541	1.0500295	1.3124528	0.3218	0.43291142351	1.24991994	5727	2655	3866.0028	3618.7153	2.0111932	1.9422296	-0.0503	0.0487344851475	0.96571015	31433	8002	18166.472	11442.425	5.4385138	4.6753984	-0.2181	-0.134171763417	0.85968316	12505	4915	7800.1916	6806.5566	2.7866624	2.9630673	0.0886	-0.077746637462	1.06330337	2272	1204	1719.6496	1574.5178	1.1129914	1.1004881	-0.0163	0.451666160057	0.9887668	1464	728	1160.7508	959.2679	0.6681875	0.5489793	-0.2835	-0.270294782855	0.82159469	2662	2416	1978.427	3274.9942	1.4646245	1.778281	0.2800	-0.0318782741317	1.214154910	4341	4169	3041.4572	5741.0556	2.3207706	3.9199591	0.7562	0.186607804977	1.689076511	12921	8024	8037.3344	11476.5	4.8718541	7.2808234	0.5796	0.228137977978	1.494466612	2853	1711	2101.3801	2280.1229	1.4926577	1.5592931	0.0630	0.121574726545	1.044642113	1414	1636	1123.7831	2177.0212	1.7332578	2.7212923	0.6508	0.0723998675806	1.570044714	8970	4747	5742.4355	6565.2697	2.6612887	2.7640458	0.0547	0.0248199253386	1.038611815	2540	1791	1895.8117	2393.4186	1.2872845	1.6404634	0.3498	0.20465258233	1.274359616	4019	1665	2841.4432	2216.8692	1.6065328	1.2960138	-0.3099	-0.212210750802	0.806714817	1863	1376	1442.2933	1815.5682	0.8752556	0.9152583	0.0645	-0.269545920823	1.045703918	10910	3850	6875.3389	5286.7852	1.6072276	1.8025209	0.1654	0.0189857615072	1.121509519	1904	1800	1471.3551	2406.2236	1.2933665	1.468543	0.1833	-0.134127463256	1.135442320	1064	707	869.4214	933.6648	0.7682413	0.680747	-0.1744	-0.0439199523206	0.886111!sample_table_end
