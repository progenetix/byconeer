Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481563/suppl/GSM481563_EL625.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2939	2729	2979.0638	2686.3877	0.7984518	0.7149005	0.1595	-0.0913052021431	1.11687122	4755	4447	4776.2944	4367.269	1.4148004	1.2663187	0.1600	0.0499622010336	1.11725463	3105	2678	3143.1429	2635.3303	0.8834502	0.7197264	0.2957	0.0549465283157	1.22748054	12091	14714	11939.751	14639.244	3.2400863	3.9796607	-0.2966	-0.252725957876	0.81416145	13206	22439	13000.226	22534.899	4.1512611	6.9164493	-0.7365	-0.263075459748	0.60020116	10060	10587	9980.3368	10459.961	3.1065498	3.2629982	-0.0709	-0.104640944023	0.95205377	1904	2790	1946.6791	2746.842	0.8061068	1.1196763	-0.4740	-0.138991068411	0.71994628	2293	2931	2331.1323	2881.0798	0.7240436	0.9364212	-0.3711	-0.228664076813	0.77320299	4052	4632	4082.9117	4548.4102	1.1639325	1.2637721	-0.1187	-0.0809968667203	0.920998710	12240	12846	12083.385	12740.429	3.5703727	4.0257191	-0.1732	-0.0520548381905	0.886890611	10081	12257	10000.592	12142.287	3.1713511	4.0771477	-0.3625	-0.43067544977	0.777835712	5595	6112	5624.4806	6023.619	2.0134628	2.1750111	-0.1113	-0.153825823215	0.925725313	1773	1772	1817.297	1742.5008	0.6418376	0.6400947	0.0039	-0.043628576947	1.002722814	6369	7873	6385.2166	7759.2074	2.5241041	2.869943	-0.1853	-0.248255068549	0.879496215	2099	2075	2140.3569	2038.0944	0.7456398	0.72809	0.0344	0.0227015918515	1.024103916	1950	2305	1992.3426	2264.9597	0.7554803	0.8523911	-0.1741	0.0457312013831	0.886307117	1206	1000	1253.8715	989.9019	0.3551737	0.2802189	0.3420	0.127174185363	1.267486518	5050	5249	5076.0784	5163.7604	1.6856372	1.5973315	0.0776	-0.044053026326	1.055283219	2066	1950	2107.5777	1917.6706	0.5956066	0.5539722	0.1045	-0.108714356121	1.075156120	3871	3118	3906.3848	3059.5143	1.0158334	0.8498229	0.2574	0.0946259164841	1.1953472!sample_table_end
