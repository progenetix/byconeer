Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481900/suppl/GSM481900_MR314.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6729	5365	6700.462	5342.1658	1.5926897	1.2214899	-0.3828	0.0513084755524	0.76693532	5261	5696	5263.1816	5663.3795	1.4042057	1.488866	0.0845	0.0159573658663	1.06029063	8197	6529	8117.9889	6475.454	1.7010285	1.2867647	-0.4027	-0.0184586956319	0.75646274	11188	11972	11035.832	11836.095	2.1939595	2.3079191	0.0731	-0.0208484805056	1.05194245	18902	18711	18458.73	18642.612	3.8272917	3.8254957	-0.0007	-0.162249474682	0.99953076	10358	11906	10235.24	11770.47	2.3277378	2.5494164	0.1312	0.0006859826477	1.09523357	3376	3656	3393.8774	3667.4103	0.841125	0.8903022	0.0820	-0.0246038478871	1.0584668	4578	4349	4589.0921	4351.6493	0.8080193	0.7748212	-0.0605	-0.0524056225741	0.95891419	7014	7102	6977.6116	7026.1637	1.7408746	1.7533405	0.0103	-0.0442440097898	1.007160710	19312	17715	18850.047	17619.306	3.3505522	3.2422082	-0.0474	-0.166855105905	0.967663811	29001	25168	27939.527	25416.701	5.0741443	4.7626907	-0.0914	-0.0384030293811	0.938619512	11156	12608	11004.912	12468.605	2.3011069	2.6275174	0.1914	-0.000425167163703	1.141849313	13671	12333	13435.173	12195.089	2.9091291	2.7344822	-0.0893	-0.133512863682	0.939965914	10066	11445	9953.9023	11312.104	2.8892065	3.2607945	0.1746	-0.211034513016	1.128612515	7917	7213	7845.9103	7135.3873	1.5012343	1.367124	-0.1350	-0.0264128363313	0.910666716	6702	6414	6674.193	6365.6084	1.4035441	1.3139542	-0.0952	-0.13544783717	0.936168817	5676	5167	5679.3729	5147.589	1.4618414	1.2893259	-0.1812	-0.0143239650501	0.881987618	7560	7940	7505.3066	7848.4023	1.8515134	1.8281274	-0.0183	-0.0138449241417	0.987369219	7382	6179	7335.6146	6136.5458	1.8276605	1.5259685	-0.2603	-0.130846085707	0.8349320	5877	4325	5881.692	4328.0045	1.0494903	0.7879485	-0.4135	-0.0403552200643	0.7507916!sample_table_end
