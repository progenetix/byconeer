Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481659/suppl/GSM481659_JA815.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4516	4284	4376.1577	4291.5684	1.4419954	1.3871995	0.0559	-0.0354494796905	1.03950112	3676	4196	3552.8611	4207.8476	1.102771	1.1306918	-0.0361	-0.256458509181	0.97530643	3225	2679	3124.9498	2740.8196	1.2308491	1.1537746	0.0933	-0.107179707456	1.0668024	5189	5477	5029.2852	5415.5498	2.0912926	2.4932001	-0.2536	-0.593386750897	0.83879855	7753	9533	7488.0551	9237.7087	3.3472212	4.287604	-0.3572	-0.553092888246	0.78067416	7099	6694	6863.0493	6565.6893	2.6976981	2.765326	-0.0357	-0.166114207868	0.97554437	1112	840	1069.4668	925.8179	0.7954917	0.7633328	0.0595	0.0317627402447	1.04212968	1628	1397	1572.2071	1489.988	0.7005164	0.6878874	0.0262	-0.170269789046	1.01835929	5541	6548	5372.76	6428.2793	1.613461	1.6362018	-0.0202	-0.110006230946	0.986101510	4718	7598	4571.9116	7408.9095	1.489155	2.4388939	-0.7117	-0.381583795756	0.610586211	13257	12252	12753.461	11817.474	4.5164691	4.2745991	0.0794	-0.174088430145	1.056583112	3359	3782	3255.0941	3804.6615	1.4977867	1.9159264	-0.3552	-0.435717386621	0.781755913	4250	3903	4115.5034	3922.755	1.6262096	1.7455555	-0.1022	-0.0546217230472	0.931628714	8552	11268	8260.6495	10890.007	2.3310866	2.6051426	-0.1604	-0.342296892554	0.894801915	3289	3496	3188.0551	3532.1112	1.2365681	1.3844293	-0.1629	-0.0450524626403	0.89319716	1545	1447	1489.7038	1540.7792	0.8124674	0.9319518	-0.1979	-0.0402478099769	0.871791217	1910	2153	1850.9357	2239.4967	0.6020176	0.6369073	-0.0813	-0.0803505331728	0.945220218	4290	5209	4155.0823	5161.0772	1.3657223	1.6910736	-0.3083	-0.169526811253	0.807606719	4460	3745	4321.9537	3768.7835	1.5259218	1.1766658	0.3750	0.233546361065	1.296818420	1832	1706	1773.0895	1798.6763	0.5560187	0.5254065	0.0817	-0.122119566067	1.0582638!sample_table_end
