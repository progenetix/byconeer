Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481886/suppl/GSM481886_MR300.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	9679	6077	8462.1198	6349.184	1.9275864	1.5947331	-0.2735	0.0488616829739	0.82732122	6292	4538	5738.8003	4731.3441	1.2883693	1.1904405	-0.1141	0.197693691622	0.92399013	7950	4715	7088.8788	4916.1142	1.6454772	1.2369419	-0.4117	-0.183062785312	0.75172234	11342	9150	9804.3301	9595.0766	2.4741343	2.3978918	-0.0452	-0.0553561082664	0.96918415	19927	12830	16613.895	13624.367	3.9080468	3.4916758	-0.1625	-0.0307813447322	0.8934586	10127	9401	8822.6813	9866.2733	2.2222193	2.7111525	0.2869	-0.113308301875	1.22002027	1986	3349	2038.9206	3489.077	0.8529756	0.9328311	0.1291	0.0570596778673	1.093628	3895	3081	3736.1894	3209.6323	0.7489142	0.766977	0.0344	0.076632835554	1.02411869	9305	7313	8159.5685	7669.5779	1.7957716	1.7897351	-0.0049	-0.10239320352	0.996638510	11049	10466	9565.1644	11044.602	2.2736182	2.6649819	0.2291	-0.305435643815	1.172132511	31236	21545	25266.741	23474.033	6.6665791	5.8156196	-0.1970	-0.0444917056497	0.872354412	11144	8169	9643.1916	8549.5153	2.7803668	2.3123646	-0.2659	-0.0101099982634	0.831676113	6219	9000	5676.1078	9433.1842	2.7473599	2.5104025	-0.1301	-0.0928887927927	0.913750914	14955	11352	12687.83	12021.627	3.7908073	3.1372663	-0.2730	-0.0569509060704	0.827598515	5149	6573	4811.3549	6891.698	1.4730912	1.5816366	0.1026	-0.150615952013	1.073685416	4173	4880	3977.4602	5090.3064	1.3182027	1.316351	-0.0020	-0.0356310907632	0.998595317	3402	2944	3305.5472	3062.6818	0.7435299	0.7831243	0.0749	-0.0830702026575	1.05325218	4490	5877	4250.4381	6137.3008	1.4573282	1.6309347	0.1624	-0.0996302659217	1.119126619	7541	5753	6765.6295	6008.4896	1.5345793	1.550951	0.0153	-0.14691027454	1.010668520	5052	2871	4730.0132	2984.7471	0.7554252	0.6380625	-0.2436	-0.112120072632	0.8446402!sample_table_end
