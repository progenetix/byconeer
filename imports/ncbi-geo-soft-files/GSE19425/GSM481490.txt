Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481490/suppl/GSM481490_DE397.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2021	1424	1651.4462	1709.8076	1.1314069	1.2247193	0.1143	0.160350869439	1.08247462	1051	1055	848.8534	1282.6744	0.8133714	1.0613961	0.3840	0.398772389956	1.30493413	2184	1337	1784.6457	1610.5473	1.2570795	1.337734	0.0897	0.189196434798	1.06416024	4128	2278	3337.6232	2698.4146	2.4159058	2.207805	-0.1300	0.1818255304	0.91386225	10031	5827	7889.2556	6957.4116	5.8352084	5.8999678	0.0159	0.0507015887167	1.0110986	6039	2754	4828.4958	3257.8115	3.6989017	2.8274262	-0.3876	-0.302933381054	0.76439617	1235	806	1006.5254	994.7629	1.0710896	0.9573822	-0.1619	-0.164103616057	0.89383958	1138	706	922.1499	879.0326	0.6483917	0.6521249	0.0083	-0.0449679653353	1.00575769	1281	1200	1043.6456	1449.3778	0.9367701	1.1465295	0.2915	0.0905626947208	1.223917610	4502	3458	3627.5643	4091.5611	3.0450008	3.1588589	0.0530	-0.0797049616951	1.037391811	8718	7394	6906.7126	8906.8496	5.4483379	6.9729964	0.3560	0.0716636951036	1.279839212	1810	1451	1476.3308	1740.1908	1.4946614	1.5962795	0.0949	0.264940509166	1.067987313	1717	1853	1401.3731	2208.5845	1.8282999	2.2236013	0.2824	0.193860036785	1.216212514	5175	3648	4153.6481	4317.7063	3.441991	3.4305622	-0.0048	-0.0235521441322	0.996679615	2099	1815	1715.6142	2166.692	1.5013431	1.75508	0.2253	0.210713278486	1.169006516	1442	1105	1175.0148	1340.876	1.1712606	1.1956831	0.0298	0.185741738865	1.020851417	1032	835	833.3171	1028.8773	0.7449645	0.798324	0.0998	0.0646588440662	1.071626818	2631	1386	2144.4013	1666.7336	1.5096036	1.4255548	-0.0826	-0.242744472681	0.944323919	1596	1325	1304.2441	1596.7731	1.1303594	1.241689	0.1355	0.0679272270335	1.098490520	1014	663	818.6029	828.7952	0.6890748	0.6483105	-0.0880	0.0522198579483	0.9408419!sample_table_end
