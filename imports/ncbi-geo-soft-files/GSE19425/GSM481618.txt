Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481618/suppl/GSM481618_EL688.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3016	2722	3055.4759	2690.8017	0.9671915	0.8046972	-0.2654	-0.186602454062	0.83199372	3110	3358	3148.2849	3294.8118	1.2927201	1.2229629	-0.0800	-0.0163593817642	0.94603843	2138	2029	2154.1867	2034.1855	0.6028861	0.601045	-0.0044	-0.0204703844798	0.99694614	24799	14145	23379.239	13800.659	6.8370404	4.2822776	-0.6750	-0.142407251521	0.62633495	12768	14898	12455.402	14548.736	4.2932078	4.8679718	0.1813	-0.37213654372	1.13387756	12857	9053	12538.685	8805.5083	4.0377	2.8762646	-0.4893	-0.38555440173	0.71235227	2038	2644	2053.3028	2615.1375	0.9266165	1.0165215	0.1336	-0.1348259587	1.09702518	2814	2240	2850.2624	2229.7054	0.8387192	0.7062291	-0.2481	-0.238067897412	0.84203299	3283	3061	3319.7446	3012.397	1.3194145	1.0828155	-0.2851	-0.108154756065	0.820678710	17828	16510	17133.758	16155.684	5.8122808	5.7690691	-0.0108	-0.070764012705	0.992565411	7258	4025	7228.0188	3928.0783	2.3721509	1.3590255	-0.8036	-0.889800266888	0.572908512	8381	6386	8311.4764	6208.3308	3.1077946	2.2856212	-0.4433	-0.208304765971	0.735447913	1863	1792	1871.7772	1808.8151	0.7260031	0.6732102	-0.1089	-0.0454052704007	0.927282814	3450	3640	3483.9731	3561.9669	1.59505	1.4375943	-0.1499	-0.198132134546	0.901284715	1797	1458	1802.0106	1490.7939	0.5956636	0.4874578	-0.2892	-0.145561802667	0.818344116	1492	1826	1488.0993	1841.0699	0.5676587	0.6691446	0.2373	-0.0353880310632	1.178779717	544	383	450.0284	474.5289	0.1785656	0.1742813	-0.0350	0.0266282710467	0.976007118	4847	4916	4882.1616	4792.9538	1.7510438	1.5999458	-0.1302	-0.0598257606805	0.913709819	1399	1483	1390.2978	1514.0264	0.5292278	0.5422171	0.0350	0.00727689294788	1.024543720	3530	2527	3563.7813	2501.6567	1.0522874	0.8164619	-0.3661	-0.108793818885	0.7758924!sample_table_end
