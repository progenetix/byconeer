Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481698/suppl/GSM481698_JBH098.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1103	1108	1069.2491	1130.3262	0.9227085	0.8787805	-0.0704	0.0714260469447	0.95239242	925	1037	882.3552	1064.5925	1.2001821	1.1974387	-0.0033	-0.0428702626744	0.99771423	1503	1198	1481.856	1217.314	0.908761	0.7661927	-0.2462	-0.0869848212342	0.84311784	5327	4583	5278.8149	4348.8157	3.5051921	2.9926336	-0.2281	-0.0446312606551	0.85377165	9816	8994	9562.8659	8472.973	6.1483102	5.6137734	-0.1312	-0.05666225896	0.91305966	4363	4063	4342.6116	3863.596	2.8320796	2.5058984	-0.1765	-0.198171161794	0.88482637	1122	788	1088.8683	835.8147	1.0113415	0.8264007	-0.2914	-0.271249836999	0.81713318	1240	1061	1212.2351	1086.4986	0.8829612	0.8373316	-0.0766	-0.0753049116129	0.94832219	878	1219	833.0438	1237.4081	1.1429887	1.4096063	0.3025	0.258653871441	1.233263610	2923	3205	2921.6985	3069.5328	2.6855873	2.9739122	0.1471	0.0378726198152	1.107360111	4653	4384	4627.0613	4162.0703	4.0969935	3.9119593	-0.0667	0.0108438457386	0.954836612	1868	1483	1850.8871	1483.1575	1.6610588	1.4947898	-0.1522	-0.036399664226	0.899901813	1194	1267	1163.5398	1283.2635	1.2984106	1.5534322	0.2587	0.0963845241565	1.196410614	1798	2455	1781.3367	2381.7355	2.6809465	2.7493995	0.0364	-0.0319589844561	1.025533215	1426	1406	1402.1671	1412.7299	1.1711389	1.3100424	0.1617	0.175509016386	1.118605516	1064	1057	1029.0461	1082.7609	0.892908	1.0479227	0.2309	0.0633982913488	1.173606617	500	479	433.024	550.7375	0.5404598	0.58677	0.1186	0.109668256952	1.085686718	1902	1832	1884.3855	1803.1865	1.2897725	1.1101428	-0.2164	-0.239927099741	0.860727619	714	837	659.5606	881.2426	0.8256806	0.9701872	0.2327	0.14690190579	1.175015220	726	528	672.222	595.4898	0.6479191	0.5797297	-0.1604	0.0711192842835	0.8947563!sample_table_end
