Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481525/suppl/GSM481525_DE490.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2910	4436	3458.1729	3716.4912	0.8884873	0.9294139	-0.0650	0.0486898516732	0.95596512	4206	4893	4914.1174	4097.8482	1.68506	1.393787	0.2738	0.294036289408	1.20897953	4286	4767	4998.4202	3988.6773	1.1789989	0.902146	0.3861	0.529677944006	1.30688254	21520	23476	18738.348	23301.688	4.3018753	5.1190403	-0.2509	-0.217056831093	0.84036755	14499	13188	13720.516	12412.038	3.8034841	3.2307649	0.2354	0.228147215554	1.17727046	9991	17236	10200.774	16710.221	2.722776	4.3805445	-0.6860	-0.558226863132	0.6215617	3248	4723	3842.5664	3952.04	1.3749158	1.3451388	0.0316	-0.149253965978	1.02213678	3788	8857	4452.8409	7846.9204	1.0277846	1.8476466	-0.8462	-0.791108224974	0.55626689	1749	2583	2074.5565	2212.5563	0.6526399	0.699145	-0.0993	-0.0709844793821	0.933482810	11756	13039	11610.597	12253.075	3.3138875	3.5960155	-0.1179	0.107052274044	0.921544211	12686	12458	12337.653	11637.668	3.1458464	3.0292076	0.0545	0.0716219619232	1.038504712	14227	13315	13517.258	12547.728	4.2842259	3.8334824	0.1604	0.599423777896	1.117580613	2613	4253	3104.8952	3567.2088	1.0364763	1.2097186	-0.2230	-0.0896455272411	0.856791314	7702	5554	8336.8479	4672.2104	3.351442	1.8258316	0.8762	0.886551786085	1.835570115	1931	2799	2297.8253	2386.599	0.5977972	0.6129223	-0.0360	0.00767029244241	0.97532316	1873	3054	2227.1626	2585.1522	0.6902453	0.7703259	-0.1584	0.132971596879	0.896043217	536	562	590.4569	559.1309	0.1863829	0.1757935	0.0844	-0.0252620294332	1.060237918	3435	6911	4051.37	5932.811	1.3521751	1.9166677	-0.5033	-0.536685364876	0.705482219	1834	2526	2179.0028	2167.2014	0.6131293	0.6174638	-0.0102	-0.139052739247	0.992980120	1884	3778	2240.7304	3167.8674	0.5680707	0.8582078	-0.5953	-0.392141584298	0.6619267!sample_table_end
