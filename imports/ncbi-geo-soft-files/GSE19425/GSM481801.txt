Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481801/suppl/GSM481801_MR043.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5045	6241	5085.4057	6150.5311	1.2419767	1.3621499	-0.1332	-0.192867781293	0.91177682	3742	4094	3802.1696	4031.2248	1.0722373	0.9930377	0.1107	0.184453090051	1.07975483	4709	5388	4756.9792	5315.1712	1.0557235	1.1030091	-0.0632	-0.232884654465	0.95713034	9756	8815	9649.6497	8723.8033	2.032233	1.8345594	0.1476	0.179991359095	1.10774995	20068	16888	19361.231	16897.621	5.2399055	4.8596264	0.1087	0.0735863675213	1.07825286	14016	13567	13700.276	13486.574	3.286021	3.1566383	0.0580	-0.0576864631747	1.04098757	4799	4390	4845.3973	4326.6798	1.2188179	1.1958013	0.0275	-0.0455710305181	1.01924798	3676	4018	3738.3956	3954.4378	0.8127766	0.9428153	-0.2141	-0.0269259956164	0.8620749	9876	10692	9764.4769	10579.153	2.6148693	2.4034556	0.1216	-0.00125631188957	1.087962410	18518	17275	17914.034	17294.889	4.3245546	4.4263986	-0.0336	0.00190266944499	0.976991711	17524	17778	16986.518	17810.463	4.1431707	4.6521726	-0.1672	-0.0531932908988	0.890588312	7104	6662	7090.9072	6569.7041	1.6077231	1.725302	-0.1018	0.11430585072	0.931850313	7247	7490	7230.9835	7398.4385	2.0136111	2.1465221	-0.0922	-0.107210382883	0.938080814	8856	12940	8793.7092	12843.317	2.4820566	2.7006505	-0.1218	0.0721626151284	0.919058815	6330	5971	6331.3346	5885.9285	1.3621291	1.4396393	-0.0798	-0.204224359508	0.9461616	7375	6973	7355.9375	6881.3936	1.6120105	1.7248199	-0.0976	-0.144908368886	0.934596417	2417	3217	2490.1932	3161.1707	0.6579021	0.7297373	-0.1495	-0.0383210392054	0.901560218	6464	8339	6462.4677	8252.0985	1.8830871	2.0205266	-0.1016	0.0862467989185	0.931978419	3429	5033	3498.3662	4961.4996	0.8484292	1.0743011	-0.3405	-0.266076972151	0.789749920	2312	2778	2384.7845	2722.6433	0.7247178	0.7165425	0.0164	-0.0512959250158	1.0114094!sample_table_end
