Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481641/suppl/GSM481641_JA797.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	979	1591	1277.2065	1191.3681	1.2185231	0.9726267	0.3252	-0.0652748746974	1.25281692	571	1586	646.3142	1188.5367	0.8019047	1.1588286	-0.5312	-0.226028614324	0.6919963	1013	1574	1324.4084	1181.7333	0.8947889	0.8722948	0.0367	-0.15435894919	1.02578724	2857	5325	3491.1073	3482.3985	2.2232969	2.7363734	-0.2996	-0.172134501031	0.81249765	6746	10591	7079.6432	6979.0557	5.1266943	5.5201797	-0.1067	-0.491051259652	0.92871876	3307	5783	3948.126	3780.1691	2.9106915	2.9309315	-0.0100	0.130708058346	0.99309447	1174	1267	1555.5747	998.9135	1.4104942	0.9113495	0.6301	-0.0221504096316	1.54769848	1278	1210	1694.1405	967.7481	1.1039521	0.8280936	0.4148	0.19457034966	1.33312489	753	1433	943.3904	1099.5292	1.1536532	1.046429	0.1407	0.0160495358559	1.102466810	1364	2627	1807.8243	1801.2495	1.4836494	1.9075431	-0.3626	-0.0660982382128	0.777780311	5387	5706	5910.2278	3729.7244	4.3058121	3.7360904	0.2048	-0.104928228342	1.152491412	1231	2497	1632.109	1722.6887	1.4312555	1.7691053	-0.3057	-0.288857603331	0.809027913	647	1361	783.5815	1053.9683	1.0022881	1.3908403	-0.4727	-0.228859441571	0.720634914	1595	5200	2102.213	3402.3907	2.6685304	3.1332485	-0.2316	-0.234985328605	0.851681715	1100	1907	1449.5755	1378.4973	1.1545459	1.3969322	-0.2749	-0.00390915201937	0.826486716	797	1283	1009.7592	1007.5828	0.8307355	0.939786	-0.1779	-0.0296458990499	0.883962417	548	631	603.297	606.4385	0.7264084	0.5768254	0.3326	-0.118228770043	1.25932118	956	2929	1245.2504	1981.8063	1.1257842	1.448911	-0.3640	-0.238839033577	0.776986419	631	965	756.6779	824.7291	0.9408213	0.8178813	0.2020	0.0653722642317	1.150315120	513	555	543.3345	553.42	0.4547269	0.5271718	-0.2133	-0.315881321103	0.8625782!sample_table_end
