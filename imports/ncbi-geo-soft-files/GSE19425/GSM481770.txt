Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481770/suppl/GSM481770_JBH542.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2576	2072	2440.3417	2144.4503	1.2311453	1.1004572	-0.1619	0.0468144167419	0.89384832	2326	1766	2208.1096	1831.131	1.0190239	0.8507415	-0.2604	-0.163429226064	0.83485923	1273	1198	1230.9851	1247.4629	0.7620231	0.7865939	0.0458	0.00461586846588	1.03224414	6348	4034	5922.3981	4128.9837	3.5903092	2.612806	-0.4585	-0.276699761949	0.72773845	8489	7362	7908.6154	7446.0973	5.1398652	4.9725907	-0.0477	-0.318760729002	0.96745546	5894	4281	5503.2512	4378.3242	3.5617795	2.893545	-0.2998	-0.147008259057	0.81238747	1344	1133	1296.8773	1181.7214	0.9034454	0.8471328	-0.0928	-0.176497353487	0.9376698	1506	1053	1449.4227	1098.5948	0.8379617	0.6747211	-0.3126	-0.241194393627	0.80519329	4502	3895	4217.011	3989.7006	1.7934307	1.7474813	-0.0374	0.0511904046799	0.97437910	4175	4319	3914.3541	4416.634	2.5972854	2.8145374	0.1159	-0.0661433827081	1.083645711	11048	8498	10285.487	8555.2736	6.6865488	5.6890633	-0.2331	-0.13846762381	0.85082212	2611	1853	2472.6435	1918.0181	1.5863992	1.2885332	-0.3000	-0.104585643936	0.812237713	1457	2035	1402.7589	2105.883	1.0498092	1.4152281	0.4309	0.0892021239219	1.348081214	7860	6612	7324.5207	6703.8751	4.3284386	3.4656008	-0.3207	-0.215852760718	0.800658415	1783	1749	1710.88	1814.244	1.0868068	1.1602403	0.0943	0.0572854229435	1.067568116	1211	1346	1173.4929	1398.2132	0.7534563	0.9036033	0.2622	-0.0429333684722	1.199277617	1068	1193	1038.7993	1242.4289	0.4969456	0.608908	0.2931	0.0321145293045	1.225301118	2497	2413	2366.8635	2495.7576	1.3711749	1.3898592	0.0195	-0.0980113906917	1.013626519	1652	1807	1587.7623	1871.829	0.771653	0.9267511	0.2642	0.0157885625226	1.200994620	1328	1120	1282.0402	1168.5372	0.7426508	0.6234139	-0.2525	0.0285610900549	0.8394442!sample_table_end
