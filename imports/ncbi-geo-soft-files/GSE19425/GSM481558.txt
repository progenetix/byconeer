Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481558/suppl/GSM481558_EL216.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3114	2434	2891.4267	2567.3936	1.9347603	1.7123773	-0.1762	0.0649718104388	0.88505912	1990	1776	1869.4554	1857.3969	1.1911299	1.2023504	0.0135	-0.0298639115507	1.009423	1297	832	1240.3932	887.6534	0.766811	0.5405871	-0.5043	-0.16482389633	0.70498094	3951	2485	3645.1396	2622.0425	2.2104798	1.5576028	-0.5050	-0.470894207874	0.70464465	15750	14171	13929.78	15147.392	9.5563062	10.202563	0.0944	-0.263457483361	1.06762626	11625	8576	10411.722	9118.7043	7.081383	6.1151064	-0.2117	-0.308098249271	0.86354697	1159	1202	1110.6959	1261.6117	0.6620435	0.711597	0.1041	-0.185524487885	1.07484928	1323	1408	1264.0933	1476.7603	0.7313474	0.8605293	0.2347	-0.164178849745	1.17663539	4486	4312	4116.3591	4571.3535	2.2949321	2.6271839	0.1951	0.118016521744	1.144776310	11146	10697	9999.3051	11392.36	5.8638005	6.8073244	0.2153	0.0888610006438	1.160906511	12366	7455	11047.457	7922.4071	6.272192	4.643247	-0.4338	-0.328939488683	0.740290912	2731	1860	2541.6083	1950.285	1.3730615	1.0298371	-0.4150	-0.438370441877	0.750029813	1849	1310	1742.308	1373.0687	0.8534339	0.6567963	-0.3778	-0.166040928897	0.769592514	3416	2528	3167.378	2668.1334	2.0657563	1.7448132	-0.2436	-0.250026070173	0.844636515	996	982	949.1886	1039.1942	0.5493392	0.6089978	0.1487	0.180559218895	1.108600516	1356	1405	1294.1419	1473.6315	0.6370685	0.6945856	0.1247	-0.20709053822	1.090284117	665	554	619.9944	613.0997	0.4267655	0.4319576	0.0174	0.139949702238	1.012166218	3042	2292	2825.5514	2415.0101	1.7937433	1.4235198	-0.3335	-0.253129338837	0.793602819	1154	966	1105.89	1023.0771	0.7116815	0.6871484	-0.0506	0.0453916647055	0.965527920	2392	1209	2234.0262	1268.7292	1.3504049	0.790047	-0.7734	-0.373159683985	0.5850445!sample_table_end
