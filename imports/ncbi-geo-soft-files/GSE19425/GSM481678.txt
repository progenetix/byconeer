Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481678/suppl/GSM481678_JA942.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1404	1112	1322.794	1189.5584	0.7727828	0.6873143	-0.1691	0.0915166467755	0.88940172	1551	1545	1470.5373	1620.9112	1.18492	1.3170421	0.1525	0.182496916685	1.11150293	2831	2294	2759.6923	2353.2366	1.0350068	0.8741282	-0.2437	-0.0199123415758	0.84456274	10654	11788	10797.957	11443.309	4.5767269	4.7772951	0.0619	0.0886356658476	1.04382355	15004	18882	15259.789	18144.517	5.0795189	6.0935505	0.2626	0.0743770540843	1.19963146	8056	7316	8128.8581	7188.4847	3.3651407	2.9193622	-0.2050	-0.0766593503681	0.86753057	2497	2679	2424.2194	2730.832	1.3509092	1.5235553	0.1735	0.0897181992871	1.12779998	3146	3510	3080.4096	3545.3708	1.3158945	1.4793744	0.1689	0.104538757169	1.12423489	1333	1085	1251.6618	1162.2356	0.985275	0.9256962	-0.0900	-0.088722946226	0.939530810	5589	6479	5577.0607	6388.1158	2.4418059	2.6642019	0.1258	0.0883680944246	1.091078411	8214	7092	8292.2216	6974.957	3.494032	2.9428421	-0.2477	-0.124276828197	0.842248212	5204	6439	5181.1338	6349.7411	1.9588039	2.3991272	0.2925	0.138765198912	1.224791913	1834	1607	1752.5234	1681.5129	0.7933891	0.764438	-0.0536	-0.165919485333	0.963509514	3718	4672	3665.4033	4664.5394	3.0561579	3.8245965	0.3236	0.294169601836	1.251439415	3434	3247	3377.6714	3289.8227	1.1034389	1.0624031	-0.0547	0.0957103115422	0.96281116	1560	1577	1479.5423	1652.2094	0.5765043	0.652407	0.1784	0.101513732954	1.131660117	578	400	514.3916	464.4941	0.3895925	0.351008	-0.1505	-0.0295349982193	0.90096218	3467	3222	3411.7388	3265.1987	1.3311937	1.2362351	-0.1068	-0.217390126058	0.928666519	961	684	887.7673	757.2945	0.6801919	0.5959567	-0.1907	-0.0875924055912	0.876159620	799	604	729.1294	674.7024	0.4362956	0.3874175	-0.1714	0.00665794353317	0.8879701!sample_table_end
