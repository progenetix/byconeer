Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481879/suppl/GSM481879_MR291.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3507	3332	3453.3349	3366.233	1.2398428	1.1732229	0.0797	0.0881386110436	1.05678372	4184	3592	4098.3836	3625.0571	1.8035853	1.4978038	0.2680	0.123472323351	1.20415323	3297	2653	3247.9186	2681.8607	0.9878811	0.8077742	0.2904	-0.015122088453	1.22296694	14596	13053	13800.067	13341.901	4.0750618	4.0187914	0.0201	-0.153581816455	1.01400185	24273	24171	22468.033	24839.221	7.3665695	7.9504376	-0.1100	-0.221478825876	0.92656156	9802	12588	9379.0213	12859.888	3.1673806	4.3625045	-0.4619	-0.272874485764	0.72604647	2742	3041	2709.4333	3071.0672	0.9412101	1.0579268	-0.1687	-0.108187349381	0.88967418	3114	3444	3068.5202	3478.1037	0.9766851	1.1570904	-0.2445	-0.0804156507773	0.84408719	4100	4414	4017.0942	4462.4399	1.6165757	1.6783032	-0.0541	0.0245503217351	0.963220310	11827	9642	11259.463	9816.755	4.2149533	3.9832133	0.0816	-0.0484297951317	1.058179111	10927	9956	10421.865	10143.809	3.5176636	3.6320411	-0.0462	-0.0874954771847	0.968508812	8787	7784	8437.3164	7913.7081	3.0396184	2.896772	0.0694	-0.167662077719	1.049312313	2688	2703	2656.9179	2733.2825	1.2524036	1.3495056	-0.1077	-0.0697698385422	0.928046214	11650	11408	11095.541	11643.396	5.4218803	5.1090048	0.0858	-0.0736245426376	1.0612415	1945	1781	1932.7535	1803.4143	0.6655457	0.6362914	0.0649	0.0365956070047	1.045976316	2728	2664	2695.8193	2693.265	0.9071876	0.9206848	-0.0213	0.00698417775861	0.9853417	808	775	783.8315	819.6779	0.3470435	0.3452011	0.0077	0.0425948927409	1.00533718	4668	5958	4562.8298	6034.5264	1.5461035	1.948647	-0.3338	-0.165193093047	0.793424119	1453	1543	1446.1353	1569.5053	0.6415387	0.675362	-0.0741	-0.0465864793006	0.949918320	3036	2654	2992.7479	2682.8993	1.0568864	1.0632519	-0.0087	-0.0829241749312	0.9940132!sample_table_end
