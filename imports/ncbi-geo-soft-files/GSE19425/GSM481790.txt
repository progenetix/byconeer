Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481790/suppl/GSM481790_MR028.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3220	2846	3144.72	2895.7232	1.2152823	1.1083311	-0.1329	-0.0996324146493	0.91199472	1884	1883	1870.4862	1901.8909	0.745028	0.7360209	-0.0175	0.086488948051	0.98791043	3431	2816	3343.6254	2864.3503	1.2838098	1.1105204	-0.2092	-0.159043701479	0.86501944	10035	7365	9366.6502	7631.9799	3.7590749	3.0476224	-0.3027	-0.364140020773	0.81073745	19796	11703	18221.822	12280.145	7.3029196	4.8605547	-0.5874	-0.565906246932	0.66556326	7409	9568	7004.3066	9996.1587	2.8142141	4.0297309	0.5180	0.634612318399	1.43192057	2641	3264	2599.0424	3326.7138	0.9650818	1.317107	0.4486	0.434145990027	1.36476218	2143	2218	2119.7134	2240.3693	0.8853872	0.9339796	0.0771	-0.157455517974	1.05488269	3972	3466	3850.7544	3536.0376	1.4392565	1.2640528	-0.1873	-0.122737058434	0.878267910	8686	8672	8158.7203	9031.5692	3.7787883	4.0629552	0.1046	0.131380604366	1.075200511	11889	9912	11040.611	10366.779	5.0326795	4.7102194	-0.0955	-0.0203633472259	0.935926812	4583	4170	4415.4591	4269.3085	1.9457347	1.8683072	-0.0586	-0.32611353961	0.960206513	3458	3299	3369.0914	3363.1718	1.4550969	1.4397471	-0.0153	-0.033043761	0.98945114	8973	8030	8416.4457	8343.0995	3.2161254	3.1079423	-0.0494	-0.206458013277	0.966362315	2925	2809	2866.8413	2857.032	1.1360638	1.1153051	-0.0266	-0.0163223490752	0.981727516	2526	2425	2487.9417	2457.9528	1.0141578	1.0019911	-0.0174	-0.198758518616	0.988003217	1198	1263	1212.4641	1266.2391	0.4815994	0.4873156	0.0170	0.0764096873969	1.011869218	4376	5413	4225.0338	5573.1156	1.5878733	2.0695379	0.3822	0.249708794711	1.303339419	2052	2228	2032.0488	2250.8867	0.8405751	0.8892459	0.0812	0.0928013110211	1.057901820	984	939	1005.9366	935.5879	0.4150261	0.3802019	-0.1264	-0.163676730281	0.9160917!sample_table_end
