Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481965/suppl/GSM481965_MR417.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6233	3782	5841.834	3881.4782	1.4205917	0.9229019	0.6222	0.21061778216	1.53926612	7047	7242	6514.1846	7691.6475	1.6529375	1.9477029	-0.2367	-0.132338639355	0.848663	3920	2572	3829.0643	2661.0601	0.8713864	0.6020566	0.5334	0.214707611038	1.44734954	13124	9813	11498.948	10629.151	2.6307943	2.4514642	0.1019	0.0395536618173	1.07315225	19270	15394	16686.923	16891.869	3.8238817	3.8027493	0.0080	-0.000442123926535	1.00555716	10100	9448	9040.652	10206.768	2.2168344	2.4629342	-0.1519	-0.152830042751	0.90007867	3113	3180	3080.7033	3260.214	0.6792072	0.7213622	-0.0869	-0.0386141451556	0.94156198	3056	4248	3024.1929	4381.8289	0.6815143	1.0168378	-0.5773	-0.251031456921	0.67022919	6850	6457	6354.5692	6813.1094	1.5245834	1.6016222	-0.0711	-0.10203022376	0.951899510	15029	10645	13087.814	11566.964	3.2646549	3.0218937	0.1115	-0.0402312244359	1.080334111	20360	14288	17622.079	15684.362	4.2283183	3.9024286	0.1157	0.073105356733	1.083509412	11991	7783	10570.439	8316.075	2.3466553	1.8766742	0.3224	0.291021765899	1.250432913	6762	4470	6282.4772	4622.3906	1.5075734	1.157362	0.3814	0.265253006726	1.302594514	11346	9915	10047.233	10745.678	2.827006	2.9263194	-0.0498	0.0634682895976	0.96606215	4870	4497	4682.0635	4651.0889	1.0126344	1.023032	-0.0147	0.0182228121141	0.989836416	4187	3783	4073.0374	3882.574	0.8670215	0.8178185	0.0843	0.168386589179	1.060163817	1881	1267	1851.8988	1408.272	0.4635933	0.3591332	0.3683	0.141978897393	1.290867118	5675	6516	5364.9262	6877.7982	1.2979187	1.5884064	-0.2914	-0.280760947271	0.8171219	3779	2981	3701.7972	3061.2743	0.8854556	0.7544517	0.2310	0.084389923241	1.173641220	3883	3736	3795.5905	3831.0769	0.8676275	0.9371107	-0.1111	-0.0248526709691	0.9258538!sample_table_end
