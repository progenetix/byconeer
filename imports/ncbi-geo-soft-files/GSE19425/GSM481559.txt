Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481559/suppl/GSM481559_EL621.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2361	2236	2521.6273	2084.1563	0.778796	0.643385	0.2756	0.00302893032976	1.21046642	3134	2813	3322.4811	2625.11	1.1702007	0.9187328	0.3490	0.17875236903	1.27371153	2568	2321	2733.4637	2163.7649	0.8655432	0.6706837	0.3680	0.0656772185224	1.29053864	9180	15484	9416.062	14602.99	2.9388403	4.6945183	-0.6757	-0.460125323161	0.62601535	8983	23462	9224.7058	22465.911	3.3479455	7.8803347	-1.2350	-0.653310513937	0.42484816	6859	11731	7125.629	10965.72	2.5188912	3.9001414	-0.6307	-0.592905624547	0.64584617	1120	2368	1227.4987	2207.9633	0.6444071	1.131139	-0.8117	-0.466392778576	0.56969758	1277	2390	1393.7334	2228.6531	0.5639019	0.9232189	-0.7112	-0.550978078927	0.61079979	2600	3894	2766.6662	3622.9454	0.9182078	1.2113937	-0.3998	-0.404720294467	0.757976310	9085	12578	9324.2357	11773.322	3.263348	4.4493217	-0.4472	-0.362628542694	0.733448411	6132	8680	6394.9	8099.1129	2.4103202	3.2263014	-0.4207	-0.60840310437	0.747084612	4449	7552	4672.3752	7042.6532	2.0259335	2.9338435	-0.5342	-0.507538089166	0.69053913	1120	1329	1227.4987	1254.5551	0.5161923	0.5424051	-0.0715	-0.0332846396292	0.95167314	5318	8385	5576.5023	7824.868	2.3702712	3.2595357	-0.4596	-0.577789135166	0.727180615	1611	1795	1733.5841	1677.2951	0.7380965	0.7082501	0.0596	0.0323425184351	1.042140916	1572	2178	1693.1092	2030.9755	0.747475	0.9008226	-0.2692	-0.136815340598	0.829769317	695	571	780.098	552.5225	0.2674291	0.1901911	0.4917	0.101795817235	1.406106818	3790	5050	3991.2229	4698.9365	1.3746112	1.5627296	-0.1850	-0.359593484039	0.879621919	1481	1551	1599.8765	1454.2785	0.5454802	0.5168964	0.0777	-0.11414814948	1.055298920	2551	3206	2715.8205	2983.9331	0.8347792	1.0089355	-0.2734	-0.446167569265	0.827386!sample_table_end
