Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481865/suppl/GSM481865_MR269.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5125	5497	5217.9369	5385.0457	1.3171697	1.3876139	-0.0752	-0.22360846197	0.94923362	5566	5879	5658.0512	5753.4591	1.5003682	1.4988635	0.0014	-0.0483705958942	1.00100393	3576	3945	3649.9087	3868.9867	0.8443902	0.9228267	-0.1282	-0.317081899295	0.9150044	9302	8781	9431.592	8568.7628	2.3680896	2.2322502	0.0852	-0.11390515674	1.06085315	14807	14451	15043.265	14036.489	3.5658776	3.3655956	0.0834	-0.0492375076027	1.05950866	7870	8169	7997.0259	7977.3355	1.9848768	2.0544359	-0.0497	-0.127364789264	0.9661427	3070	3707	3135.3351	3635.4086	0.6986329	0.796927	-0.1899	-0.187392343467	0.87665868	2900	3146	2964.2774	3086.6703	0.733381	0.7979664	-0.1218	-0.0539682846944	0.91906259	6681	7693	6781.5788	7517.5991	1.703516	1.8347368	-0.1071	-0.131289279502	0.928479710	13732	15376	13939.906	14941.123	3.6548882	4.097937	-0.1651	-0.174255411587	0.891884911	15929	17607	16187.222	17085.183	4.2618492	4.6679539	-0.1313	-0.109117471073	0.913001612	7468	9244	7590.2942	9019.8973	1.7502688	2.1085673	-0.2687	-0.32417104625	0.830074913	5633	7452	5725.1888	7286.4737	1.4733244	1.8957409	-0.3637	-0.277906851084	0.77717614	10019	11800	10159.018	11496.042	2.6482806	2.8673723	-0.1147	-0.132247338367	0.923591515	4404	4946	4488.1758	4845.6099	1.0865629	1.1827427	-0.1224	-0.044320951779	0.918680716	4614	6120	4698.8468	5988.4162	0.9959075	1.2834459	-0.3659	-0.198069325734	0.775963817	1603	2008	1639.1994	1977.9865	0.430561	0.5162652	-0.2619	-0.264369828241	0.83399218	5500	6541	5591.8983	6405.6182	1.314365	1.4844143	-0.1755	-0.126073547637	0.885443519	3464	4268	3535.7476	4179.8268	0.937338	1.1049025	-0.2373	-0.134018476083	0.848344520	3121	3370	3186.8088	3301.5587	0.8725764	0.9403491	-0.1079	-0.166848692374	0.9279282!sample_table_end
