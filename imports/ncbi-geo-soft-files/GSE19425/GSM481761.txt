Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481761/suppl/GSM481761_JBH531.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1225	1171	1267.3131	1140.6405	1.0524701	0.8809291	0.2567	0.0995893023378	1.19472732	685	865	707.9282	856.3783	0.8228785	0.8607044	-0.0648	0.0958003597647	0.95605233	1335	1130	1378.3941	1103.0418	0.8540675	0.6870287	0.3140	0.169672988699	1.24313224	9148	6555	8864.6486	6232.0708	4.8696418	3.5623145	0.4510	0.0756161441926	1.36698815	12284	12248	11652.327	11643.585	7.6239147	7.8732984	-0.0464	-0.0940339025283	0.96832536	5622	5840	5596.6412	5554.7615	4.0419106	4.061553	-0.0070	-0.0112752400329	0.99516387	2191	2145	2245.2503	2057.1326	1.2391653	1.2174084	0.0256	-0.0713138707804	1.01787148	2074	2003	2131.0601	1926.9744	1.0111113	1.0107046	0.0006	0.040084996706	1.00040249	1156	1349	1195.7978	1307.3007	1.3346425	1.2200496	0.1295	-0.0160232187502	1.093924710	10837	10237	10378.096	9723.3204	5.107289	5.0082996	0.0282	-0.0205485420556	1.01976511	7937	7743	7763.6486	7349.7177	3.6617053	3.7751934	-0.0440	0.0109648355262	0.969938412	6318	4203	6264.5405	3991.0859	2.944968	2.1172015	0.4761	0.10178331419	1.390971913	1786	1880	1844.226	1813.3264	0.9238062	0.9055542	0.0288	0.0649276764992	1.020155614	2052	3063	2109.5967	2920.1079	3.386457	3.9256351	-0.2131	-0.166015985436	0.86265215	1747	1442	1804.5102	1397.8932	0.7968942	0.6815431	0.2256	0.11815769463	1.169249916	1552	1701	1600.7854	1641.114	0.7304075	0.8492634	-0.2175	0.063455587998	0.860048217	284	266	241.3867	304.3551	0.264496	0.3010031	-0.1865	0.014615525977	0.878715118	2095	1903	2151.5381	1834.8518	1.8914166	1.5662748	0.2721	0.119019055029	1.207589219	601	700	616.9315	704.0578	0.637627	0.6274316	0.0233	0.14117745186	1.016249320	2227	1769	2280.4578	1706.0304	1.1340789	0.8393158	0.4342	0.0601013539857	1.3511944!sample_table_end
