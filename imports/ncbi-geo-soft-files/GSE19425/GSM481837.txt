Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481837/suppl/GSM481837_MR161.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4891	5198	4663.2273	5459.6487	0.9566787	1.1183063	-0.2252	-0.2375676997	0.85547112	7043	6664	6633.6063	7032.1231	1.3642194	1.4027414	-0.0402	-0.0907697815224	0.9725383	4632	4010	4431.1346	4184.7167	0.8297363	0.8047167	0.0442	-0.211349616013	1.03109124	13144	12711	12143.746	13385.641	2.7674962	2.8409539	-0.0378	-0.23051278319	0.97414335	19679	17226	18213.188	18000.74	3.5821296	3.4708201	0.0455	-0.118041155706	1.032076	12528	12669	11583.091	13341.927	2.3283472	2.6380932	-0.1802	-0.234159875906	0.88258717	2369	2502	2323.6191	2590.0593	0.6437553	0.7111337	-0.1436	-0.193493747609	0.90525218	2503	3214	2450.3323	3342.653	0.6065893	0.8097717	-0.4168	-0.335824317984	0.74908679	8923	9695	8332.4047	10233.767	1.6280644	1.9494151	-0.2599	-0.369304266601	0.835155310	14435	14840	13339.738	15568.866	3.4035338	4.4067604	-0.3727	-0.350838365764	0.772343711	17365	18575	16047.978	19376.544	4.1245561	5.2511638	-0.3484	-0.24585873726	0.785455612	8313	9604	7775.1332	10137.475	2.317156	2.9055613	-0.3265	-0.199209015116	0.797489913	4285	5212	4114.9971	5474.6804	1.1409719	1.7140842	-0.5872	-0.567417324239	0.665645214	15145	15256	14002.876	15989.484	2.5157879	2.7935095	-0.1511	-0.199743921193	0.900583215	4386	3861	4207.663	4023.5969	1.1569767	1.1079936	0.0624	-0.104531866053	1.044208816	3102	4308	3011.7305	4500.8719	0.8751304	1.2204207	-0.4798	-0.360114821171	0.717072717	2273	2924	2231.1295	3032.3341	0.4485386	0.5943097	-0.4060	-0.493337739449	0.754721918	7769	8955	7286.9393	9454.1235	1.2167344	1.5313016	-0.3317	-0.30911421982	0.794575219	4169	4661	4008.1053	4874.4667	0.875856	1.0422616	-0.2510	-0.219765519478	0.840341820	2877	3199	2796.9986	3326.9327	0.6212735	0.807045	-0.3774	-0.297488196114	0.7698127!sample_table_end
