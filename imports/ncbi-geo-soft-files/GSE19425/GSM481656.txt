Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481656/suppl/GSM481656_JA810.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3119	2294	3001.1307	2218.4491	1.4554566	1.3752415	-0.0818	-0.0468248013772	0.94488662	2393	1917	2332.62	1869.6399	1.0617057	1.1740641	0.1451	0.362711809196	1.10582823	2384	1934	2324.6143	1885.6609	1.242954	1.1935047	-0.0586	0.0164389817913	0.96021634	3990	2718	3782.5059	2610.112	2.6903664	2.1085208	-0.3516	-0.0456254989265	0.78372995	8830	5747	8068.8762	5410.6869	4.535236	3.3430703	-0.4400	-0.255255691198	0.73713266	5913	5773	5482.8888	5434.6825	2.8861351	3.4034603	0.2379	0.369994830661	1.17924497	1845	2527	1828.8963	2430.9495	1.0761938	1.1972478	0.1538	0.258570058827	1.11248358	1060	1410	1086.923	1400.0746	0.7758731	0.9565423	0.3020	0.425832445082	1.23285929	3238	2419	3105.3927	2330.9433	1.3434278	1.4200863	0.0801	0.217462645709	1.057061810	2637	4659	2558.5613	4413.6908	2.2661354	2.7231026	0.2650	0.0475784514366	1.201650411	6302	7543	5837.696	7093.1053	4.6772784	4.4693068	-0.0656	0.0325099602748	0.955535712	3140	3948	3019.5531	3749.0887	2.2015156	1.8888033	-0.2210	-0.156664348904	0.857955813	1245	3109	1262.2116	2981.302	1.253756	1.5218623	0.2796	0.0488120325252	1.213842414	6835	5361	6311.0974	5056.4333	3.0925392	2.6858277	-0.2034	-0.0361447589412	0.868486215	1692	3654	1690.8187	3478.1601	1.2403291	1.7699239	0.5130	0.390944423168	1.426979216	1456	2360	1464.7525	2277.6996	0.9355189	1.0566357	0.1756	-0.0653745030996	1.129464917	2024	1264	1991.9598	1258.2851	0.9176878	0.7828065	-0.2293	-0.263295886265	0.853020518	3277	3986	3140.1888	3784.1656	1.4977774	1.6639152	0.1518	0.0310566455274	1.110922919	2363	1990	2305.9257	1938.401	1.219967	1.4007721	0.1994	0.0113112826929	1.148204820	924	726	957.2665	758.7978	0.7607581	0.5558449	-0.4528	-0.175467884362	0.7306461!sample_table_end
