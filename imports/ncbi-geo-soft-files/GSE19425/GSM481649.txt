Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481649/suppl/GSM481649_JA805.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2061	3949	2439.8647	3374.9764	1.2035404	1.4106803	-0.2291	-0.229128069042	0.85316312	696	2571	1147.4853	2079.8675	1.170085	1.1999673	-0.0364	0.109929233592	0.97509743	3724	4923	3986.6465	4304.8946	1.1178193	1.3576223	-0.2804	-0.0689752948546	0.82336544	12153	8281	11273.839	7434.1628	2.5588804	2.2003931	0.2178	0.148998381908	1.16291965	20916	17393	18554.194	16104.167	5.0099714	4.7931851	0.0638	-0.0138317127802	1.0452286	8333	7201	8026.0594	6436.2846	2.5631296	2.2590718	0.1822	0.408502967574	1.13459417	2995	2252	3328.3608	1781.7836	0.7836842	0.6018746	0.3808	0.104392890274	1.30207218	4196	3012	4422.0499	2502.9441	0.792115	0.6051165	0.3885	0.112788192834	1.30902899	983	3782	1434.0031	3214.4171	1.5648308	1.8288136	-0.2249	-0.0862038683704	0.855653510	12666	13767	11710.267	12622.61	1.9720831	2.6849709	-0.4452	0.00338016687677	0.734489511	37345	29959	31911.259	28742.259	5.5440564	6.753457	-0.2847	-0.283521027308	0.820921312	10174	7770	9604.7628	6964.6875	1.7781797	1.9445947	-0.1291	0.108645955856	0.914421713	10832	10705	10154.456	9707.3934	2.0787615	2.6948552	-0.3745	-0.11779941627	0.771381514	1818	7032	2206.7528	6279.6379	2.8502779	4.1603717	-0.5456	-0.127291435263	0.685101715	9887	12091	9361.8724	11015.423	1.761887	2.4403836	-0.4700	-0.0681738225901	0.721971316	5592	6181	5683.6046	5487.1887	1.0924035	1.6234596	-0.5716	-0.195466250586	0.672886217	597	2195	1040.5563	1730.2708	0.9078967	0.9298495	-0.0345	-0.337416777936	0.97639118	1713	4447	2109.4055	3833.5402	1.3106311	1.8051469	-0.4619	-0.129980108475	0.726052319	464	2728	871.3713	2236.7294	0.8048935	1.2504718	-0.6356	-0.257015779385	0.643671820	1400	2149	1814.681	1687.9839	0.5603244	0.5141993	0.1239	-0.281120685834	1.0897028!sample_table_end
