Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481461/suppl/GSM481461_DE358.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3737	3595	4040.2502	3229.1714	1.9141307	1.4841826	0.3670	-0.085924499059	1.28968672	1714	1877	1962.8941	1644.8666	1.0108736	0.8254666	0.2923	0.224295687682	1.22460873	3849	2980	4148.9883	2663.2346	1.6906285	1.0690598	0.6612	0.119234514036	1.58141624	4120	6341	4415.3412	5840.7198	1.9172275	2.3829231	-0.3137	0.00431168109464	0.80456965	13885	16456	13393.634	16586.807	5.0652357	6.4450237	-0.3476	0.0108089071545	0.78591426	6635	9038	6828.1221	8547.7381	2.8062192	3.6227622	-0.3685	-0.299487429818	0.77460767	2402	3065	2687.7612	2741.1202	0.838464	0.8834815	-0.0755	-0.0532648885	0.94904538	1610	2341	1854.3041	2069.8057	0.5963891	0.706556	-0.2446	-0.131214840859	0.84407899	3393	3445	3698.0535	3091.5902	1.8455723	1.4941289	0.3048	0.114495762248	1.235216310	15058	14070	14425.209	13939.401	4.1829009	4.0943503	0.0309	-0.126446895961	1.021627511	40112	32551	35432.903	35102.52	10.979854	11.166603	-0.0243	-0.0582983245104	0.983276112	4405	4216	4702.5991	3809.3705	1.3924008	1.2141652	0.1976	0.294475950178	1.146796913	9596	7692	9566.6057	7175.5463	2.8205697	2.1092478	0.4193	0.0534219517633	1.337239614	4440	5644	4738.072	5180.5903	3.2457131	3.0802658	0.0755	0.116985487745	1.05371215	9368	6884	9361.56	6363.842	2.6315291	1.9080989	0.4638	0.0753655906125	1.379136616	4788	3921	5087.38	3533.597	1.4686314	1.0754106	0.4496	0.0838218444348	1.365647217	2293	2210	2576.3755	1951.4376	1.2877833	0.9343174	0.4629	0.0363228493007	1.378314518	3471	4223	3777.5384	3815.8789	1.6006028	1.6655209	-0.0574	-0.217013097399	0.961022319	2980	3207	3280.9933	2871.4245	1.800307	1.4908411	0.2721	-0.033949039457	1.20757820	2024	1667	2294.2879	1456.6152	0.6105439	0.3939197	0.6322	0.113600627077	1.5499193!sample_table_end
