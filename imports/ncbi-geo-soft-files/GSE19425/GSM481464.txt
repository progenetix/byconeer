Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481464/suppl/GSM481464_DE359.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5907	4723	5934.0275	4584.8183	2.0929624	1.5697649	-0.4150	-0.0369798266948	0.75002062	2223	2521	2315.1893	2457.1196	0.8352485	0.9086986	0.1216	0.113479277854	1.0879383	5502	4188	5552.876	4072.8431	1.7139088	1.2514372	-0.4537	-0.0289380679176	0.73016564	5316	7550	5377.1837	7341.1084	1.6623622	2.2727968	0.4512	0.196954835189	1.36720925	15819	21665	14806.045	22629.809	4.4610478	6.8077053	0.6098	0.216483175526	1.52603286	10049	9981	9697.4835	9800.0206	3.1368756	3.1322593	-0.0021	-0.117691389482	0.99852847	2875	3639	2988.0366	3544.3194	0.8531495	0.9729488	0.1896	0.0945530900532	1.14041998	2220	2672	2312.1587	2607.7446	0.6136924	0.6949742	0.1794	0.0256641493267	1.13244719	5521	5465	5570.8944	5297.3938	1.9730816	1.9201918	-0.0392	-0.015323890043	0.973194310	20450	16966	18808.477	17339.429	4.5308563	4.0245745	-0.1709	-0.022106254714	0.888259111	46338	36081	40585.997	39019.895	10.414416	10.039105	-0.0530	0.0287144044734	0.963962312	4085	5492	4180.2613	5323.7446	1.1553379	1.4459499	0.3237	0.214990411387	1.251538513	12475	9912	11848.451	9728.9878	3.1370564	2.4581222	-0.3519	-0.139187385278	0.78357614	8218	8860	8050.552	8649.057	3.1134118	3.4980298	0.1680	0.102063195119	1.123535815	10893	8520	10448.466	8307.1734	2.7454717	2.0984555	-0.3877	-0.0553126042606	0.764333316	5729	4569	5767.9243	4432.6181	1.4976923	1.1255438	-0.4121	-0.156140160719	0.751518717	3214	2645	3315.1793	2581.1564	1.138809	0.9079649	-0.3268	-0.0248019312941	0.797293418	6573	4823	6555.5159	4683.7025	2.0161566	1.4947052	-0.4317	-0.195106683317	0.741363619	6647	5581	6625.4125	5410.6146	2.1231953	1.8146821	-0.2265	-0.0666106787425	0.854693920	2937	2109	3048.7783	2058.1501	0.6195668	0.4176971	-0.5688	-0.0834789479904	0.6741761!sample_table_end
