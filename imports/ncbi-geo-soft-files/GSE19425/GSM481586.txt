Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481586/suppl/GSM481586_EL648.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4265	3405	4378.9089	3317.969	0.9434986	0.7082804	-0.4137	-0.154359077639	0.75069572	5112	4282	5231.1305	4147.3703	1.3383381	1.0476486	-0.3533	-0.318762510423	0.78279813	2576	2089	2621.1049	2083.8145	0.6049416	0.4846988	-0.3197	-0.0872514297829	0.80123234	18682	13426	18462.357	12851.195	4.6780156	3.2599265	-0.5211	-0.519566170055	0.69686095	17587	20042	17421.477	19272.952	4.6464267	4.9208826	0.0828	-0.556030959345	1.05906816	12692	10935	12729.79	10471.639	3.3198748	2.7395456	-0.2772	-0.153553797799	0.82519547	2416	3143	2452.3065	3069.3075	0.9005819	1.0262824	0.1885	-0.225287769595	1.13957698	3000	2284	3059.7711	2268.1101	0.933068	0.6912537	-0.4328	-0.365102259781	0.74083959	3681	3177	3761.9177	3101.5599	0.9655695	0.7982266	-0.2746	-0.203634474589	0.826689910	11034	9022	11126.217	8636.3144	4.6728012	3.7053018	-0.3347	-0.198157027122	0.792950811	7079	4884	7216.9362	4716.4729	2.873913	1.8855988	-0.6080	-0.375193398793	0.656108512	8451	6208	8578.3619	5968.6716	3.049086	2.0510512	-0.5720	-0.379041436307	0.672677413	1865	1705	1885.8768	1725.1672	0.934767	0.8122478	-0.2027	-0.0128176831101	0.868930714	8373	7136	8499.8264	6838.4707	2.2204068	1.7255031	-0.3638	-0.275955097476	0.777111215	2188	2022	2216.3492	2019.2063	0.7415929	0.6654934	-0.1562	-0.0448933403355	0.897383616	1923	2136	1944.6798	2129.0247	0.6389787	0.6608008	0.0484	-0.147522123804	1.034151517	991	697	982.5376	764.9534	0.24058	0.1878962	-0.3566	-0.00191096047403	0.781013418	6069	5995	6206.5904	5772.2991	1.5005577	1.3411546	-0.1620	-0.0855204793875	0.893770719	2661	2282	2711.6085	2266.2766	0.7256748	0.6223797	-0.2215	-0.0994277433892	0.857656520	2803	1826	2858.9004	1835.3305	1.0912894	0.7263035	-0.5874	-0.274438494749	0.6655461!sample_table_end
