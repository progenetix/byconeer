Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481923/suppl/GSM481923_MR347.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4070	3647	3899.298	3781.2256	0.9933801	0.9877309	0.0082	0.0524124160972	1.00571932	4687	4148	4473.0365	4318.6987	1.4319571	1.4036928	0.0288	0.00384340922798	1.02013563	4333	2969	4143.9189	3069.4948	0.958798	0.7277501	0.3978	0.0385770728411	1.31748244	21560	16156	19426.557	17446.433	4.3112508	4.0191067	0.1012	-0.112996127671	1.07268885	27478	20727	24545.785	22462.484	6.6345066	6.0489507	0.1333	-0.0998059929427	1.09680296	20305	14620	18324.36	15755.092	4.6938378	4.1457813	0.1791	0.0476206067765	1.13219617	3490	2823	3362.9152	2912.2527	1.2321372	1.018259	0.2751	0.11366729813	1.21004298	4577	4177	4370.5397	4349.3881	0.9431288	1.0004661	-0.0851	-0.0007203154479	0.94268949	4385	4173	4192.2143	4345.1552	1.2218228	1.2794468	-0.0665	0.0183389112693	0.954961810	17350	13911	15755.437	14963.896	4.2639943	4.2244684	0.0134	-0.0825038699572	1.009356411	15044	13473	13720.412	14475.882	3.3232656	3.6352429	-0.1295	-0.129139090498	0.914179812	9672	10230	9008.8848	10896.406	2.8535718	3.3059091	-0.2123	-0.308523222432	0.863173113	3077	2827	2976.1461	2916.4439	1.1527183	1.0954951	0.0735	0.0208243249518	1.052234914	15030	14090	13708.117	15163.521	5.0625986	5.5584903	-0.1348	-0.183907523206	0.910786615	2918	2557	2825.5339	2636.6262	0.7476149	0.6897767	0.1162	0.0622535383627	1.083850516	2339	2309	2279.6087	2377.7366	0.7155393	0.7134335	0.0043	0.0197635345276	1.002951617	1358	1025	1342.476	1070.1381	0.420836	0.3468813	0.2788	0.178163268588	1.213198718	6345	5725	5998.8021	5997.3949	1.752768	1.766883	-0.0116	-0.00406086593383	0.992011319	1962	1534	1921.3959	1579.5004	0.5726415	0.4837848	0.2433	0.112109190592	1.183669820	3408	3064	3288.5146	3171.1984	0.843637	0.8495773	-0.0101	-0.0836540944978	0.9930078!sample_table_end
