Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481941/suppl/GSM481941_MR367.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4499	3807	4291.0937	3938.7542	1.6493445	1.5499794	0.0896	0.0931204048992	1.06410732	3614	3462	3505.0185	3554.2878	1.326843	1.3758463	-0.0523	-0.0366979295174	0.96438323	2992	2498	2952.0929	2481.1757	1.2324769	1.0325434	0.2554	-0.0326356419934	1.19363214	8934	8594	8224.9373	9206.6449	3.5863386	3.947435	-0.1384	-0.232813804195	0.90852385	11959	10352	10959.928	11099.721	5.0573148	5.0290235	0.0081	-0.162411506961	1.00562566	3374	3237	3292.0196	3301.4138	1.421664	1.4103374	0.0115	-0.0361712385895	1.00803117	1530	1853	1620.0921	1770.6967	0.6309974	0.6713503	-0.0894	-0.0685775516143	0.9398938	1217	1622	1324.8556	1523.1895	0.5476511	0.6346871	-0.2128	-0.0645417458092	0.86286799	2606	2962	2604.8986	2992.8106	0.9313281	1.0781797	-0.2112	-0.0540366406778	0.863796810	8841	7307	8140.0601	7806.7628	3.6616862	3.6059245	0.0221	-0.0781522322417	1.015463911	6761	6813	6287.3981	7268.512	2.7592107	3.2533118	-0.2377	-0.18324080103	0.848123612	9070	7335	8347.9225	7837.5419	3.3070539	3.0548369	0.1145	-0.145158523035	1.082563213	4291	3353	4107.0345	3431.3299	1.7003924	1.4123108	0.2678	0.118000967954	1.203978914	6717	6459	6248.5259	6878.0278	2.5682174	2.9441555	-0.1971	-0.215043270326	0.872310415	4679	3834	4451.0067	3969.2261	1.6467838	1.4764868	0.1575	0.0829119624538	1.115339416	2760	3317	2744.4304	3390.804	1.0900074	1.2989155	-0.2530	-0.108847351379	0.839167317	498	674	600.7647	570.5305	0.2368628	0.2340049	0.0175	0.0475117262284	1.012212918	4570	3893	4354.219	4035.5791	1.7440787	1.5778349	0.1445	0.0739843005384	1.105361919	1600	1554	1685.0534	1451.3122	0.6920031	0.6183737	0.1623	0.0716255312556	1.119069320	1466	1582	1560.0993	1480.5459	0.6939483	0.6957557	-0.0038	-0.0804689032681	0.9974023!sample_table_end
