Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481880/suppl/GSM481880_MR292.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3347	3624	3265.6222	3690.6934	1.1946381	1.2773649	0.0966	0.0881386110436	1.06924842	3543	3558	3452.2417	3622.4513	1.5469778	1.5245444	-0.0211	0.123472323351	0.98549863	3342	2697	3260.8794	2750.8227	1.0218632	0.8182266	-0.3206	-0.015122088453	0.80072044	15227	11242	14334.658	11499.803	4.2986802	3.4263437	-0.3272	-0.153581816455	0.79706885	21882	16509	20439.669	16884.782	7.2302035	5.7402754	-0.3329	-0.221478825876	0.793936	12972	12046	12261.936	12332.818	4.434484	4.1840022	-0.0839	-0.272874485764	0.9435157	2875	2840	2811.5243	2893.1009	1.1138912	1.0776471	-0.0477	-0.108187349381	0.96746178	3630	3583	3535.7948	3648.3009	1.1364566	1.204344	0.0837	-0.0804156507773	1.0597369	4092	4427	3982.8653	4509.3143	1.6625594	1.7857979	0.1032	0.0245503217351	1.074125710	16502	12437	15508.687	12733.165	6.2785057	5.5480386	-0.1784	-0.0484297951317	0.883655911	11652	9061	11046.067	9266.4909	3.9469055	3.6097376	-0.1288	-0.0874954771847	0.914574112	8390	5998	8045.2485	6115.053	3.3441997	2.5260667	-0.4048	-0.167662077719	0.755357613	2708	2443	2648.3534	2496.9492	1.4989014	1.4662156	-0.0318	-0.0697698385422	0.978193514	9524	8660	9085.9002	8853.5724	5.7247868	4.8710134	-0.2330	-0.0736245426376	0.850863715	1784	1659	1746.8909	1705.723	0.6553502	0.6591502	0.0083	0.0365956070047	1.005798416	2974	3005	2907.6099	3059.0504	1.0716357	1.0981609	0.0353	0.00698417775861	1.024752117	708	659	646.9685	727.3189	0.2855917	0.3013552	0.0775	0.0425948927409	1.055195818	3899	4299	3797.3211	4378.3535	1.9096247	1.9141964	0.0034	-0.165193093047	1.00239419	1701	1643	1664.7693	1689.9619	0.7146585	0.7052847	-0.0190	-0.0465864793006	0.986883520	3921	3035	3818.4781	3089.6065	1.3888006	1.2454388	-0.1572	-0.0829241749312	0.896773!sample_table_end
