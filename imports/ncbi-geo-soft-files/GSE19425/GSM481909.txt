Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481909/suppl/GSM481909_MR323.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6576	5171	6527.1753	5131.155	1.4194443	1.1369277	0.3202	0.208391400867	1.24849122	8033	5798	7901.6118	5779.0134	2.0556431	1.5421368	0.4147	0.196792341715	1.33298353	4349	3177	4399.3188	3105.9673	0.9911665	0.7078519	0.4857	0.0825252045877	1.40024564	24793	18639	22750.967	19651.258	4.5088786	3.9409016	0.1942	-0.0664904640319	1.14412365	24334	19296	22350.065	20378.281	5.3307338	4.8754348	0.1288	-0.102056547136	1.09338636	14073	11288	13364.339	11623.049	3.2847768	2.9544307	0.1529	0.0345163394065	1.11181387	3292	3157	3370.4604	3086.3171	0.9694539	0.8528942	0.1848	0.0685410826469	1.13666388	5481	4628	5488.9786	4575.4185	1.0388856	0.8999471	0.2071	0.145414779278	1.15438519	3799	3776	3865.0296	3704.4176	0.9539455	0.9207991	0.0510	0.0770916105718	1.035997510	17933	15199	16748.208	15869.91	3.3599931	3.4189365	-0.0251	-0.101766381681	0.982759711	19848	23281	18416.178	24658.921	3.5622426	4.9948325	-0.4877	-0.308239273819	0.713185612	15174	13549	14344.983	14073.591	3.5568912	3.3825012	0.0725	-0.166120958073	1.051556513	5319	4884	5334.6665	4837.4005	1.2537163	1.1437874	0.1324	0.0502918862966	1.096109514	17784	13138	16617.191	13621.716	4.8203943	4.0695796	0.2443	0.00563568653206	1.184494415	4878	4826	4912.4305	4778.2079	1.0216811	0.9912877	0.0436	0.0259552247163	1.030660516	2885	3732	2966.6063	3659.7762	0.7438032	0.8784989	-0.2401	-0.102422290453	0.846675117	978	747	1018.8271	766.0798	0.2616935	0.2036022	0.3621	0.219818047882	1.28531818	6964	6110	6893.9527	6101.8932	1.8464904	1.678842	0.1373	0.0703845188999	1.099859519	2489	2463	2569.5087	2399.8652	0.6225291	0.5992792	0.0549	0.0179323096129	1.038796420	4001	4163	4062.9816	4101.625	0.6892767	0.7531491	-0.1279	-0.142518737499	0.9151929!sample_table_end
