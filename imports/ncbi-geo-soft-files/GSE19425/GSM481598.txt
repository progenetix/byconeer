Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481598/suppl/GSM481598_EL660.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1848	1710	1869.4804	1697.1442	1.0110067	0.8631591	-0.2281	-0.0513677275124	0.85376192	1110	897	1116.9673	913.7856	0.6538988	0.4760426	-0.4580	-0.3697847755	0.72800663	1064	849	1070.4056	867.2663	0.5139699	0.43415	-0.2435	-0.0579316871841	0.84469934	11284	8571	11113.438	8329.8543	5.3723876	4.3590453	-0.3016	-0.302605440281	0.81137955	11891	15093	11679.206	14826.378	6.452583	7.6454633	0.2447	-0.208037787809	1.18486866	9733	8520	9640.3412	8279.831	5.2443373	4.5875105	-0.1930	-0.255672767206	0.8747557	1004	1188	1008.561	1195.4272	0.6595411	0.7132659	0.1130	-0.0908412096496	1.08145778	1313	957	1323.2463	971.4177	0.6161949	0.4934024	-0.3206	-0.350569953533	0.80072469	4480	4313	4528.6127	4185.2755	2.4904088	2.0552103	-0.2771	-0.178540227544	0.825250110	12271	11460	12032.741	11178.886	5.8993742	5.9086629	0.0023	-0.136155137544	1.001574511	5082	4221	5121.4995	4096.9768	2.648237	2.2854147	-0.2126	-0.28262952158	0.862994712	5109	4724	5148.021	4574.8687	2.8069355	2.493274	-0.1710	-0.14639547796	0.888254813	1103	1261	1109.9044	1266.25	0.6374983	0.7348038	0.2049	0.143107986325	1.152636314	3575	3565	3626.326	3461.3437	2.0065322	1.6748349	-0.2607	-0.151568619127	0.834691215	1470	1328	1483.1044	1330.683	0.7802378	0.7130957	-0.1298	-0.0236711506855	0.913946616	1173	1267	1181.0421	1272.0706	0.6541726	0.6808475	0.0577	-0.0262969679532	1.040776517	443	528	431.4668	551.3419	0.2572344	0.2956962	0.2010	0.088804161531	1.149520118	4343	4399	4393.4322	4267.1552	1.766084	1.7258005	-0.0333	-0.000326446683675	0.977190519	937	1011	938.9698	1023.5192	0.5621241	0.566986	0.0124	0.116973514752	1.00864920	3004	2149	3046.2498	2115.1003	1.2905927	1.0270505	-0.3295	-0.21893212021	0.7957975!sample_table_end
