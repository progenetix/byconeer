Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481839/suppl/GSM481839_MR165.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5925	5824	5826.95	5889.2974	1.0848991	1.0921607	-0.0096	-0.045662159795	0.99335112	7534	7704	7374.706	7800.4966	1.4228361	1.4956986	-0.0721	0.00154271429632	0.95128533	4596	5013	4555.7033	5060.1574	0.923888	1.0045754	-0.1208	-0.171125617572	0.91968014	16728	15240	16050.167	15437.944	3.2379781	3.1897025	0.0217	-0.109862651186	1.01513485	21327	19171	20373.015	19407.095	4.5876823	4.3562771	0.0747	-0.0254625085964	1.05311996	12241	11657	11812.347	11808.709	2.5896201	2.5457016	0.0247	0.0991034158389	1.0172527	3371	3097	3368.4264	3118.772	0.7905609	0.7537674	0.0688	-0.0308318677246	1.04881288	4470	3890	4434.5081	3916.8262	0.9011199	0.8205134	0.1352	0.173089174364	1.09823919	9148	10109	8913.4691	10224.655	1.6450415	1.8346387	-0.1574	-0.0871175599885	0.896656910	17363	15953	16644.058	16164.114	3.455445	3.5298108	-0.0307	0.00233138592217	0.97893211	19100	16906	18275.93	17133.219	3.6689473	3.6327789	0.0143	0.00557072949003	1.009956112	10878	12000	10531.539	12158.533	2.2441073	2.7106952	-0.2725	-0.211076946951	0.827871513	9142	9485	8907.7161	9601.2095	1.6883568	1.9116151	-0.1792	-0.0889637901617	0.883209614	12282	14063	11851.152	14248.628	3.0493415	3.3704656	-0.1445	-0.0869135991008	0.904724115	4470	4951	4434.5081	4997.1571	0.8950162	1.0439941	-0.2221	-0.1140434404	0.857316	5219	6041	5148.3156	6109.4571	1.1000217	1.3509059	-0.2964	-0.142973242283	0.814284417	2505	3194	2520.317	3216.0238	0.4864882	0.6169354	-0.3427	-0.386004458489	0.788556118	5334	7545	5259.1425	7636.4938	1.367791	1.8460995	-0.4326	-0.2269910861	0.740908619	4531	4825	4493.1951	4869.1283	0.8981914	0.9872785	-0.1364	-0.129778394971	0.909764920	4369	4630	4336.743	4670.3839	0.8387491	0.9479131	-0.1765	-0.116728584986	0.8848375!sample_table_end
