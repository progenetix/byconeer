Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481502/suppl/GSM481502_DE419.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3865	2876	3266.8059	3414.6423	0.8866675	0.8918192	0.0084	0.228850821842	1.00581022	3023	3118	2582.1806	3694.398	0.7712408	1.0856194	0.4933	0.459171070618	1.40762713	5755	4026	4852.9307	4708.7472	1.5194809	1.4295621	-0.0880	0.120532299152	0.94082274	10567	11693	9031.9482	12102.091	2.643415	3.4781791	0.3959	0.231839844671	1.315795	9535	10841	8154.9864	11338.696	2.6232059	3.4191428	0.3823	0.290395384524	1.30342146	14693	7379	12473.874	8150.337	4.3553005	2.6849041	-0.6979	-0.74343957288	0.61646827	4582	2139	3857.8376	2544.4045	1.414372	0.9127182	-0.6319	-0.57081892092	0.64531698	2628	2545	2269.8553	3015.4955	0.5726588	0.7620753	0.4123	0.209184453406	1.33076689	3753	2411	3172.3872	2858.4342	0.8541113	0.7716995	-0.1464	0.0244344376879	0.903511610	25981	14216	20904.875	14345.598	5.1843162	3.6436342	-0.5088	-0.269255456559	0.702818711	26447	17352	21231.183	17103.116	5.4688394	4.4403663	-0.3006	-0.0597813998952	0.811939412	10818	13182	9242.8815	13425.388	3.0544448	4.3668668	0.5157	0.119556181471	1.429676113	8569	4348	7299.8069	5062.9281	2.1257044	1.4860816	-0.5164	-0.160165134455	0.699100814	11136	10553	9512.593	11078.507	2.8429562	3.1693221	0.1568	0.116919368979	1.114798115	6126	3698	5162.8101	4350.309	1.4561146	1.2215117	-0.2535	0.0614088942375	0.838884316	4033	2667	3409.0555	3165.9768	1.1885219	1.083047	-0.1341	0.0635808043201	0.911255417	3743	1983	3164.1898	2361.1676	0.8874537	0.6606842	-0.4257	-0.066260275605	0.744471818	5836	3658	4920.603	4306.57	1.7974004	1.5225083	-0.2395	-0.210794912456	0.847061319	5403	2932	4557.2851	3478.1468	1.2459785	0.9686918	-0.3632	-0.0581334838947	0.777454720	3112	1922	2655.7095	2289.9259	0.6786026	0.6024431	-0.1717	0.0805695300626	0.88777!sample_table_end
