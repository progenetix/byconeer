Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481510/suppl/GSM481510_DE427.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3642	2228	2617.5603	3159.8083	0.5401088	0.6492625	0.2656	0.2331562221	1.20209582	5583	4451	4076.216	5917.0293	1.0452816	1.4954583	0.5167	0.590524128327	1.43067513	4054	2946	2904.0711	4096.0665	0.6400426	0.9128417	0.5122	0.499018228245	1.426224	14219	14699	11298.035	15584.137	2.5572665	3.5594518	0.4771	0.394632230684	1.3918975	19581	18209	15746.109	18701.464	4.1022132	4.533437	0.1442	0.245681722582	1.10511986	26126	10394	20972.909	11750.775	5.0369762	2.747422	-0.8745	-0.835111874528	0.54545067	8211	3504	6190.4877	4802.9608	2.037146	1.3822395	-0.5595	-0.46476071065	0.67851768	6470	3239	4787.764	4464.3171	1.1433153	1.1097499	-0.0430	0.0260154447652	0.9706429	5059	2370	3667.5992	3343.5871	0.8485623	0.7688386	-0.1423	-0.0265991473923	0.906048610	18591	8823	14925.002	10320.751	3.1045014	2.1438818	-0.5341	-0.428284673376	0.69057211	14721	7636	11715.606	9206.5308	2.3578588	1.9177823	-0.2980	-0.229208293301	0.813357512	12913	14146	10200.287	15085.359	2.9099425	3.8917903	0.4194	0.161360929998	1.337411413	5285	3502	3844.9161	4800.4834	0.9086057	1.04005	0.1949	0.128138959697	1.144665914	11717	9145	9206.5132	10617.611	2.6429329	2.8786801	0.1233	0.193051319732	1.08919915	3785	2362	2715.3284	3333.0142	0.6418186	0.7302448	0.1862	0.239555928902	1.137774416	2936	1926	2117.5504	2742.8487	0.596066	0.7039133	0.2399	0.141524476975	1.180931817	1657	775	1230.0563	1125.9404	0.3130619	0.2827182	-0.1471	0.144072742624	0.903074218	11065	4344	8631.3082	5795.0072	2.3683178	1.5458495	-0.6155	-0.515365347417	0.652720419	3550	1656	2553.5118	2373.3721	0.5698478	0.5415	-0.0736	0.0548558380201	0.950253720	3356	1738	2415.8521	2484.2063	0.4308008	0.4687249	0.1217	0.135417059084	1.0880315!sample_table_end
