Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481803/suppl/GSM481803_MR045.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5322	6876	5747.8377	6165.8241	1.1388761	1.0703454	0.0895	0.00758590932265	1.06402672	6156	8120	6634.9603	7256.9451	1.4287469	1.3472759	0.0847	-0.0116899554766	1.06047093	2954	3257	3178.3377	3063.748	0.8427584	0.7265425	0.2141	0.0976120101077	1.15995744	9626	11208	10232.547	9912.6754	3.2386316	3.1183271	0.0546	-0.181350432628	1.03857985	10117	15821	10736.152	13945.331	3.7313065	4.2779684	-0.1972	-0.279010336653	0.87221456	7965	12003	8536.838	10604.213	2.4852211	2.6642485	-0.1004	-0.139751017287	0.93280377	2273	2872	2436.3967	2733.8078	0.7577694	0.8313896	-0.1338	-0.286277865009	0.91144928	3165	3459	3407.0632	3239.0565	0.801188	0.8422313	-0.0721	-0.116826167815	0.95126839	10498	13736	11132.277	12126.583	2.2678553	2.1517083	0.0758	-0.0207190956792	1.053978910	12662	17406	13327.302	15336.384	2.9558893	4.1235058	-0.4803	-0.12028576575	0.716838811	12767	12042	13434.02	10638.968	3.405858	3.1572766	0.1093	0.00704605629723	1.078732812	8008	9687	8580.1046	8592.6823	1.8963431	2.0849853	-0.1368	-0.0579274220625	0.909523413	3331	4294	3583.3125	3959.9515	1.2889393	1.6381071	-0.3458	-0.162646515161	0.786846814	10056	16858	10673.785	14850.406	2.6412501	2.8192835	-0.0941	-0.0729945841392	0.936851515	5025	4190	5430.1648	3867.7065	0.9060442	0.8324097	0.1223	-0.0656404238586	1.088459416	3566	4626	3836.7076	4247.6542	0.8883748	1.0097844	-0.1848	0.0102616642528	0.879766817	2726	3365	2932.2009	3157.5671	0.6170486	0.5770972	0.0966	0.0276530329184	1.069228218	4654	7409	5012.3684	6638.549	1.4117131	1.5777979	-0.1605	-0.0679347001955	0.894736319	3500	5013	3764.3545	4573.8566	0.7792261	0.8175816	-0.0693	0.0142454439945	0.953086520	2745	3282	2952.6434	3085.4724	0.8393987	0.825641	0.0238	-0.266702292244	1.016663!sample_table_end
