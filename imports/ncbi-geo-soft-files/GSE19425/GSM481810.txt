Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481810/suppl/GSM481810_MR062.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3707	4732	3741.3916	4680.9608	1.1661091	1.3348103	0.1949	0.130727692438	1.14467012	2886	3031	2940.5151	2991.9859	0.9911738	0.9031729	-0.1341	-0.0702745725571	0.91121543	2815	3675	2872.042	3620.2169	0.7794084	0.9687972	0.3138	0.449276742752	1.24299044	12393	9554	11635.781	9630.766	3.2520849	2.741414	-0.2464	-0.120488085365	0.84297125	16821	9903	15659.313	9984.7827	4.1857266	2.6748715	-0.6460	-0.447113112623	0.63904596	10043	9106	9527.7461	9174.3732	2.7839232	2.6162855	-0.0896	-0.0348585221465	0.93978367	3276	2708	3326.6916	2667.2252	0.7852406	0.6640269	-0.2419	-0.0893134436838	0.84563498	2738	2902	2797.5881	2862.6927	0.746071	0.7847992	0.0730	-0.0119496968659	1.05190949	4272	4893	4291.6625	4846.6544	1.3357841	1.3735657	0.0402	0.072894829782	1.028284210	13663	12593	12785.525	12697.792	3.2918856	3.3790288	0.0377	-0.00836469645797	1.026472111	16620	14034	15473.998	14131.288	4.061039	3.9437748	-0.0423	0.0356374217381	0.971124512	7771	9117	7502.4584	9185.6317	1.891071	2.4803073	0.3913	0.274653484279	1.311588613	5483	6006	5422.2991	5984.9734	1.418476	1.6318221	0.2021	0.168060219508	1.150405114	9477	9596	9027.3411	9673.3571	3.1034274	2.7962185	-0.1504	-0.0973266467257	0.901009715	4226	4199	4246.6578	4148.3355	1.0266857	1.0685586	0.0577	0.144952958893	1.040784516	3700	4410	3734.8535	4357.5339	0.8763456	1.1085488	0.3391	0.127819596546	1.264967617	829	962	880.0622	980.1366	0.299214	0.2978738	-0.0065	0.197740486542	0.995520718	4935	5793	4919.7397	5769.4757	1.3687623	1.4497571	0.0829	-0.131615663472	1.059173719	2401	2968	2463.4617	2929.6001	0.841185	0.894169	0.0881	0.0939001902651	1.062987320	2628	2350	2689.7857	2321.164	0.7110161	0.6338272	-0.1658	-0.160603624844	0.8914387!sample_table_end
