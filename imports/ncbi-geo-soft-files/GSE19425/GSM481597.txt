Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481597/suppl/GSM481597_EL659.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2294	2820	2492.1698	2581.0702	1.0030996	0.9196177	0.1254	-0.0513677275124	1.09077892	2251	3566	2446.1949	3249.9853	1.0200458	1.2399028	-0.2816	-0.3697847755	0.8226823	1321	1532	1434.4682	1438.4203	0.5498113	0.503262	0.1276	-0.0579316871841	1.09249514	8316	12293	8891.412	11077.504	3.8254264	4.7216146	-0.3037	-0.302605440281	0.81019455	10747	21331	11362.554	19481.826	5.2823641	8.3512168	-0.6608	-0.208037787809	0.63252626	6694	10925	7198.2604	9834.2962	2.9050279	3.6221556	-0.3183	-0.255672767206	0.80201637	2271	3119	2467.58	2850.0667	1.0556557	1.2948626	-0.2947	-0.0908412096496	0.81526468	2025	3013	2204.3255	2753.0115	0.7138278	0.9292676	-0.3805	-0.350569953533	0.76816179	2904	3975	3151.0063	3611.5201	1.2309371	1.3011082	-0.0800	-0.178540227544	0.946068210	13621	16831	14199.197	15256.894	4.3051558	5.2076968	-0.2746	-0.136155137544	0.826690911	8120	11075	8687.058	9971.7743	2.5506244	3.2569763	-0.3527	-0.28262952158	0.783126412	5539	6281	5988.0621	5653.0029	1.7995694	1.9581459	-0.1218	-0.14639547796	0.91901713	1829	1599	1993.059	1497.8474	0.6411645	0.6060413	0.0813	0.143107986325	1.057955114	3632	5261	3941.1176	4749.4997	2.020535	2.0808734	-0.0425	-0.151568619127	0.971003315	1372	1314	1490.5216	1244.7297	0.4625603	0.4368583	0.0825	-0.0236711506855	1.058833616	1458	1572	1586.537	1473.9161	0.5171342	0.5582042	-0.1103	-0.0262969679532	0.926424817	403	396	385.2207	422.2518	0.1548641	0.1573989	-0.0234	0.088804161531	0.983895218	3818	5066	4138.7411	4581.0246	1.6573288	1.6202591	0.0326	-0.000326446683675	1.022878819	1395	1452	1516.2242	1367.4939	0.5357004	0.4594487	0.2215	0.116973514752	1.165963520	2701	3264	2935.8426	2981.5892	0.7661792	0.82593	-0.1083	-0.21893212021	0.9276563!sample_table_end
