Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481785/suppl/GSM481785_JBH561.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1454	1602	1753.0751	1303.8287	1.4266052	1.0253204	0.4765	0.218069903438	1.3913752	861	1415	1063.5356	1156.8397	1.190429	1.1157389	0.0935	0.234772543806	1.06694233	1366	1728	1650.6589	1406.6331	0.9758336	0.9036272	0.1109	0.119709818102	1.07990734	8605	6703	9157.8168	5625.3174	5.6984419	3.7370793	0.6087	0.151712072505	1.52483835	14485	14053	14740.728	12196.125	9.3144996	8.579523	0.1186	0.382607496545	1.08566646	4601	5584	5136.1977	4664.5349	3.2890843	3.3189156	-0.0130	-0.0872712622662	0.99101177	1213	1648	1475.2148	1340.385	1.2425181	1.2072326	0.0416	0.0687642131178	1.02922848	1202	1578	1462.3037	1284.7457	0.8811926	0.8251785	0.0948	0.0291454079074	1.06788129	1148	1902	1398.6994	1552.8525	1.5106217	1.393664	0.1163	0.0428892946335	1.08392110	4813	6439	5353.4573	5397.0403	3.3820408	3.5737332	-0.0795	0.0097721062744	0.946360711	9438	9816	9965.6803	8386.9117	5.9697905	5.5155794	0.1142	-0.0960189166429	1.082350612	4255	3114	4776.9367	2560.5385	3.1608043	1.8160641	0.7995	0.407779323316	1.740469513	1902	2961	2255.8121	2431.623	1.6066275	1.6955895	-0.0778	0.133351116989	0.947533314	3202	4770	3668.5472	3971.5395	4.7780807	4.0986959	0.2213	0.220095141797	1.165756315	1460	2141	1760.0984	1752.1716	1.0661885	1.1082482	-0.0558	0.0251863125938	0.962048516	1070	1753	1306.4631	1427.6525	0.8484843	1.011223	-0.2531	-0.048306282137	0.839067517	415	750	517.0773	623.23262	0.5454162	0.6013211	-0.1408	-0.00818853110156	0.907029918	1432	2437	1727.3188	1996.9088	1.4080789	1.5484249	-0.1371	-0.0107928350776	0.909362119	563	1098	703.385	896.8971	0.7823902	0.869155	-0.1517	-0.172416409911	0.900173420	1307	1391	1582.8706	1137.4653	1.0185953	0.7246536	0.4912	0.129017206813	1.4056306!sample_table_end
