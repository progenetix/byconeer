Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481516/suppl/GSM481516_DE433.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3130	2591	2705.0867	3036.5273	0.5924919	0.6201665	0.0659	0.144990666721	1.04670882	4862	5497	4278.3773	6055.6957	1.1621641	1.491294	0.3598	0.351245783301	1.28320433	5250	4713	4656.3259	5271.5253	0.9010128	1.0219204	0.1817	0.172383822078	1.13419084	14102	16643	13743.998	15419.037	2.9469137	3.2991211	0.1629	0.289618015182	1.11951735	24699	28795	24315.176	24877.887	3.7048828	4.1272513	0.1558	0.196926013128	1.11400316	21482	15189	21173.233	14290.052	4.4852286	2.8420449	-0.6583	-0.633166880291	0.63364557	10744	7502	10241.87	7913.0968	2.1142466	1.634994	-0.3709	-0.214726304881	0.77332238	5101	4066	4510.9659	4623.1136	0.9346756	0.9768029	0.0636	0.0621721500769	1.04507159	4056	2967	3541.7751	3454.5372	0.9088	0.8077005	-0.1701	-0.0785874959485	0.888754910	8807	6201	8221.8553	6733.9462	2.4471285	1.9965337	-0.2936	-0.355582796355	0.815867911	11995	11149	11555.508	11003.264	2.8895013	2.8256653	-0.0322	-0.106526975872	0.977907612	14164	18006	13807.123	16468.813	2.9400072	3.5045752	0.2534	0.105928918765	1.192029413	4436	2869	3877.708	3344.3525	1.1021917	0.9255406	-0.2520	-0.199518397878	0.839727414	10029	12135	9492.8368	11813.181	2.524432	2.7195345	0.1074	0.181183733866	1.077285715	3611	2765	3137.1985	3228.0814	0.673042	0.6802839	0.0154	0.0626489454687	1.010759916	2794	2035	2410.2002	2416.2322	0.4513869	0.4641774	0.0403	0.0169711971932	1.02833617	1501	1025	1291.9186	1252.0069	0.3501571	0.3092427	-0.1793	-0.14593472202	0.883154118	11564	8825	11101.309	9057.7999	1.966503	1.5790859	-0.3165	-0.350490800776	0.802991819	2677	2029	2307.744	2409.4889	0.6390693	0.607344	-0.0735	-0.113057602204	0.95035720	1769	1235	1526.0306	1497.4167	0.4633016	0.451922	-0.0359	0.126877201877	0.9754381!sample_table_end
