Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481829/suppl/GSM481829_MR107.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3670	4656	3981.1489	4307.3463	1.0202754	1.0544927	-0.0476	0.0137438035261	0.96755092	3889	6026	4204.3538	5609.1928	1.3814709	1.5342946	-0.1514	-0.122861188728	0.90039483	4306	4752	4622.0291	4397.6451	0.9954855	0.956686	0.0574	-0.00822233762736	1.04055614	8902	9378	9203.6075	8850.8371	1.9118528	1.9246964	-0.0097	-0.091425827134	0.9933275	16685	16193	16818.313	15535.273	3.6018193	3.3421359	0.1080	-0.00286363229043	1.07769986	10546	11452	10801.644	10870.603	2.5681112	2.6168714	-0.0271	-0.121467668916	0.9813677	4569	4436	4889.5889	4094.3364	1.1547194	1.0651462	0.1165	0.00475895098198	1.08409478	3361	3925	3665.3928	3608.4147	0.8184105	0.8355644	-0.0299	-0.0735597915564	0.97947039	8308	10364	8617.3918	9808.9782	2.7092948	2.5559464	0.0841	-0.0224969569212	1.059996710	20961	21548	20960.892	20842.945	4.160957	4.5240268	-0.1207	-0.0515343834728	0.919746311	17200	17586	17316.228	16911.001	3.4718869	3.7089959	-0.0953	-0.0213718609905	0.936071912	7846	9239	8161.7554	8716.5432	1.5564374	1.8821952	-0.2742	-0.0707506333457	0.826926713	3723	4274	4035.6945	3938.0706	1.6646611	1.7675397	-0.0865	0.00221989732185	0.941795614	6949	10117	7264.7629	9568.3211	2.4415827	2.4579378	-0.0096	-0.0780218386338	0.99334615	5836	5994	6160.6693	5578.8481	1.0886853	1.1165542	-0.0365	-0.0160841836066	0.975040316	6106	6759	6423.9894	6317.1431	1.2671736	1.4129425	-0.1571	-0.0298016693992	0.89683317	2179	2884	2427.4374	2637.1568	0.7514464	0.7039831	0.0941	0.0506162030122	1.067421118	5108	7489	5433.4853	7017.2373	1.2631686	1.5019818	-0.2498	-0.169293275412	0.841001319	3249	4443	3551.7398	4101.1361	1.0720803	1.073569	-0.0020	0.0510294340091	0.998613320	3500	4143	3807.0534	3812.5288	0.8705775	0.8356335	0.0591	0.0140238635743	1.0418173!sample_table_end
