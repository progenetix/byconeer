Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481804/suppl/GSM481804_MR046.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4049	4944	4376.1703	4531.6931	1.0253373	0.9738261	-0.0744	0.00758590932265	0.94976162	5046	6388	5411.7499	5842.8703	1.3553737	1.2575412	-0.1081	-0.0116899554766	0.92781883	3119	3911	3382.6841	3605.1298	0.9663366	0.9537942	-0.0188	0.0976120101077	0.98702064	10792	9494	10929.074	8649.2549	2.8805697	2.1570225	-0.4173	-0.181350432628	0.7488185	13475	12272	13389.982	11228.409	4.4250065	3.4459551	-0.3608	-0.279010336653	0.77874576	8825	9585	9073.985	8733.093	2.6704748	2.3586293	-0.1791	-0.139751017287	0.88322467	2006	1661	2159.2516	1679.5016	0.8703524	0.6421052	-0.4388	-0.286277865009	0.73775318	3587	3322	3878.1777	3093.2682	0.8965181	0.8015298	-0.1616	-0.116826167815	0.89404749	9152	10684	9380.3273	9756.7881	2.2929239	2.1138956	-0.1173	-0.0207190956792	0.921921410	14836	14912	14624.774	13675.03	2.6932905	3.1801121	0.2397	-0.12028576575	1.180753411	16944	13944	16521.165	12772.619	3.3448954	3.1311997	-0.0952	0.00704605629723	0.936112912	9768	7925	9966.07	7213.1724	2.8373426	2.8788702	0.0210	-0.0579274220625	1.01463613	3441	3809	3723.9133	3518.7434	1.2742609	1.2925436	0.0206	-0.162646515161	1.014347714	9358	12581	9575.2952	11514.926	2.5247866	2.4356046	-0.0519	-0.0729945841392	0.964677415	5087	3045	5453.3574	2846.8314	1.0542508	0.8843255	-0.2536	-0.0656404238586	0.838818916	2363	2603	2559.1848	2469.395	0.900443	1.038166	0.2053	0.0102616642528	1.152950217	2404	3136	2603.8691	2927.2918	0.6478344	0.6295676	-0.0413	0.0276530329184	0.971803318	6997	8847	7334.2296	8051.4964	1.547196	1.5737998	0.0246	-0.0679347001955	1.017194819	3786	5470	4097.8247	4996.3184	0.9811004	1.0499236	0.0978	0.0142454439945	1.070148920	7456	5282	7774.6513	4829.6517	1.5127555	1.0280659	-0.5572	-0.266702292244	0.6795981!sample_table_end
