Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481875/suppl/GSM481875_MR287.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4351	3522	4121.8115	3710.0709	1.1978698	1.046706	0.1946	0.0971177691147	1.14441862	4312	3404	4085.5954	3587.0325	1.4065045	1.1867111	0.2451	0.171803641451	1.18521213	3839	3436	3641.8178	3620.4033	0.9247989	0.8817077	0.0688	-0.0879198764694	1.04887244	21956	16834	20419.348	17274.119	4.7921286	4.1082962	0.2221	0.0393391637718	1.16645155	22707	20113	21097.083	20612.085	6.4341495	5.9345999	0.1166	0.123386502347	1.08417576	13888	11585	13079.878	11918.295	3.8472367	3.4031807	0.1769	0.184037507618	1.13048267	3386	3271	3210.9672	3448.3622	0.9378448	0.9802588	-0.0638	0.0758766463892	0.95673188	5831	4799	5544.9118	5027.8177	1.2186628	1.1747541	0.0529	0.109908779649	1.03737699	3656	3477	3466.6029	3663.1563	1.1325159	1.1382148	-0.0072	0.195807423454	0.99499310	23559	17471	21840.136	17915.845	4.9414281	4.5142465	0.1304	0.1733175624	1.094629611	10602	15976	10030.182	16398.538	2.1004768	3.8424322	-0.8713	-0.84200928706	0.546652912	15005	13158	14104.521	13507.555	3.5874327	3.5529303	0.0139	-0.119886933727	1.009710913	4907	3729	4647.2094	3925.588	1.3408669	1.1623512	0.2061	0.116329886704	1.153581514	11279	9811	10663.723	10122.703	5.5439756	4.8502429	0.1929	0.070202452431	1.143030415	3373	2498	3198.5159	2648.9369	0.726833	0.6237808	0.2206	0.132159864936	1.165205816	3650	3417	3460.9509	3600.591	0.8810344	0.9254413	-0.0709	0.0610102428649	0.952015417	700	532	629.34	613.8919	0.2102973	0.1992938	0.0775	-0.000461721863264	1.055212418	5826	5768	5540.3025	6007.8135	2.012432	2.0414758	-0.0207	-0.0885320119649	0.985773119	2341	1983	2212.5953	2114.2331	0.6947744	0.6497148	0.0967	-0.0275008602162	1.069352820	5171	3569	4906.5171	3759.02	1.0631171	0.9219524	0.2055	0.146785801615	1.1531149!sample_table_end
