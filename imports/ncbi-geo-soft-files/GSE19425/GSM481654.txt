Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481654/suppl/GSM481654_JA808.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2763	1992	2757.3023	1981.5105	1.5331242	1.1106145	-0.4651	-0.341944156156	0.72441262	1519	1115	1524.9526	1133.275	0.9603268	0.7530675	-0.3507	-0.166871415187	0.78417833	2615	1982	2615.2073	1971.525	1.2990306	0.9434564	-0.4614	-0.190745812891	0.72627724	5910	3679	5801.7923	3589.7702	2.942511	1.7705138	-0.7329	-0.517102702265	0.60170165	8726	6433	8475.8016	6262.5096	4.2407876	2.9376335	-0.5297	-0.50310519818	0.69270946	5369	4871	5283.8214	4747.4709	2.7996302	2.4043735	-0.2196	-0.0395631251402	0.85881827	1971	2179	1972.7315	2159.4122	0.8425654	0.8031427	-0.0691	0.0312760490255	0.95321118	1478	1164	1483.601	1180.568	0.6937249	0.5592195	-0.3109	-0.212249659363	0.80611129	1880	1767	1885.4137	1758.1221	1.1252936	1.1223699	-0.0038	-0.11908059101	0.997401810	6476	5527	6347.7733	5378.6403	3.1090758	2.7873627	-0.1576	-0.386554345585	0.896524511	15682	10464	14938.188	10363.458	7.3553025	5.412765	-0.4424	-0.313453235602	0.735899712	5011	3803	4946.07	3707.7329	2.3051841	1.6247601	-0.5047	-0.424329751059	0.704828713	3628	3591	3594.8337	3507.1918	2.0195995	1.932148	-0.0639	-0.236700445906	0.956698614	4222	3339	4187.9027	3267.4664	2.7905294	2.2570625	-0.3061	-0.32669326074	0.808829515	3993	3731	3958.5506	3638.5337	1.7900322	1.5959323	-0.1656	-0.167286740473	0.891566216	2570	2599	2570.3334	2556.0164	1.1215486	0.9979263	-0.1685	-0.332490476917	0.889775317	1582	1308	1585.5811	1318.9362	0.9516441	0.8227284	-0.2100	-0.213638469429	0.864533618	3156	2578	3137.5665	2535.8436	1.771055	1.3613431	-0.3796	-0.386448583238	0.768662219	2520	2209	2520.4708	2187.7398	1.5378649	1.3964075	-0.1392	-0.215877022623	0.90801720	1153	740	1162.2933	768.0429	0.5801483	0.4200434	-0.4659	-0.268293919681	0.7240277!sample_table_end
