Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481519/suppl/GSM481519_DE484.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3710	3750	3877.109	3559.3929	1.1114634	0.9986014	0.1545	-0.0563776900895	1.11301992	4284	4906	4445.8862	4706.6865	1.5637554	1.6684982	-0.0935	-0.0175239449694	0.93722333	5198	4614	5330.6387	4416.8784	1.4195138	1.1641149	0.2862	0.126465842189	1.21939314	14492	15663	13758.292	16124.376	3.6476058	4.3085795	-0.2403	-0.034440758229	0.84659125	15072	15568	14247.201	16013.625	4.0579446	4.5128698	-0.1533	-0.163663042675	0.89919386	7895	7908	7905.765	7749.202	2.2954594	2.2231285	0.0462	-0.0460335264476	1.03253567	2921	3441	3102.116	3250.286	0.8723689	0.9286521	-0.0902	-0.114539696991	0.93939268	1951	2826	2144.8124	2640.519	0.5190475	0.6588118	-0.3440	-0.239677321034	0.7878549	3818	3806	3981.9311	3615.8728	1.3265107	1.2085706	0.1343	-0.0246219130469	1.097586410	17060	12865	15895.751	12969.045	3.8962148	3.2513051	0.2611	0.0873828628096	1.198354111	27445	21877	24131.637	23569.099	6.0380069	5.9806172	0.0138	0.0332810421717	1.009595912	11683	14395	11336.879	14672.425	2.929698	3.8490694	-0.3938	0.0196481192373	0.761144513	8473	7294	8431.1712	7127.9195	2.0789673	1.6989342	0.2912	0.133490928868	1.223689114	9347	8808	9226.0695	8664.0325	3.4610568	3.2663869	0.0835	-0.00135782527949	1.059597915	7578	6115	7615.1053	5933.258	1.7784812	1.4140324	0.3308	0.105659038485	1.257737216	4803	4578	4945.1881	4381.4654	1.2530999	1.1245107	0.1562	0.0468849449351	1.114351217	1955	1632	2148.8447	1474.6788	0.7106773	0.4902381	0.5357	0.152319989885	1.449657318	5416	5518	5542.2102	5326.7511	1.6111142	1.5465892	0.0590	0.0527586500164	1.041720819	4289	4020	4450.8497	3825.3451	1.4079149	1.2172325	0.2100	-0.00101550968913	1.156652420	2032	2482	2226.3313	2299.8258	0.5248345	0.5527135	-0.0747	-0.0600788988938	0.9495598!sample_table_end
