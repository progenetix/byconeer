Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481738/suppl/GSM481738_JBH490.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	7771	8655	7777.3803	8422.1384	1.7495289	1.817449	0.0549	0.185912330335	1.03882192	4941	5448	5062.9378	5304.1223	1.1894838	1.1773529	-0.0148	-0.0676095264871	0.98980153	5361	4639	5471.0582	4505.8624	1.2911285	1.0378474	-0.3150	-0.122793608497	0.80382974	10842	8924	10754.659	8687.7623	2.4536004	1.9929771	-0.3000	-0.216518402004	0.81226635	14844	12881	14669.851	12522.29	3.8787025	3.2176076	-0.2696	-0.215773476728	0.82955776	8194	9190	8185.0539	8950.2587	2.0441318	2.1521129	0.0743	0.130363957171	1.05282497	4261	4247	4397.1544	4125.162	0.8832684	0.8118185	-0.1217	-0.0548332625943	0.91910748	3026	3282	3168.6651	3176.141	0.6929897	0.7186543	0.0525	0.0464463572586	1.03703459	9525	11588	9497.6905	11272.689	2.1127097	2.417557	0.1945	0.199414795877	1.144292110	15629	16541	15449.138	16091.686	3.2061465	3.7782435	0.2369	0.185887979478	1.178437611	25268	21232	24966.254	20679.087	5.3026503	4.8573103	-0.1266	-0.204502236355	0.916015612	15577	9808	15397.965	9548.6768	2.9951738	1.932054	-0.6325	-0.607316899002	0.645055713	8881	9271	8869.2911	9028.7445	1.7170984	1.9464474	0.1809	0.119392434881	1.133567814	10819	10243	10732.815	9968.4179	2.8238285	2.431486	-0.2158	-0.168745375524	0.861060115	5903	5986	6004.2451	5828.8397	1.1551168	1.19565	0.0498	0.029708289994	1.035090116	5404	6176	5514.4888	6010.3465	1.1000122	1.1883675	0.1115	-0.0299388236734	1.080322117	2209	2391	2343.9192	2306.535	0.5344012	0.5015445	-0.0915	-0.0866051381421	0.938516818	4981	7093	5100.7883	6900.9845	1.4626372	1.7580074	0.2654	0.186401416495	1.201943619	5566	6944	5678.0894	6759.0515	1.2749938	1.4757704	0.2110	0.175760905882	1.157472720	4310	3659	4446.7258	3544.5695	0.7765813	0.710428	-0.1284	0.0111032812131	0.9148146!sample_table_end
