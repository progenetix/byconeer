Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481581/suppl/GSM481581_EL643.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3147	3003	3293.4672	2852.8187	0.9051683	0.8168438	0.1481	0.00199156367294	1.10812882	4749	4769	4935.28	4472.2815	1.7849452	1.5847361	0.1716	0.157693876202	1.12633593	1116	1531	1206.3776	1473.2745	0.3477115	0.4112559	-0.2421	-0.182132082156	0.84548684	20526	19534	20156.355	18229.175	5.5198222	5.1420163	0.1023	0.0875991610047	1.07347425	14534	25505	14516.153	23963.695	5.0082787	7.8549889	-0.6493	0.0442549144303	0.6375926	14352	10469	14344.463	9710.736	4.4272486	3.0102154	0.5565	0.381045765156	1.47074147	1364	2353	1462.4711	2256.5975	0.7700248	1.0824377	-0.4913	-0.023364173373	0.71138028	3568	2956	3719.4093	2811.8072	1.0847737	0.8540539	0.3450	0.149868447088	1.27014669	4352	3949	4529.0576	3725.2347	1.6229771	1.2627825	0.3620	0.147921162508	1.285238710	9358	11469	9542.8778	10634.616	3.2415025	3.6964259	-0.1895	-0.132552066489	0.876928811	9311	12627	9497.0927	11705.856	3.1392287	3.9322918	-0.3250	-0.439741302727	0.798320312	4071	6347	4243.9331	5930.9215	1.6407157	2.2739783	-0.4709	-0.492246757816	0.721517713	797	1018	868.4287	988.3281	0.3512595	0.3810836	-0.1176	-0.192466705911	0.921738714	5604	7695	5810.2529	7154.2002	2.3222634	2.8435965	-0.2922	-0.335789103697	0.816664115	1066	1374	1153.9155	1326.4954	0.3763692	0.4411375	-0.2291	-0.266002460594	0.853178816	678	1233	739.1841	1191.9676	0.3020658	0.4721294	-0.6443	-0.308699079211	0.639794517	324	320	324.8224	334.4118	0.1106592	0.1140235	-0.0432	-0.162103619219	0.970494318	4390	4952	4567.4055	4640.699	1.4262987	1.437824	-0.0116	-0.0945471679487	0.991984119	747	920	814.4536	894.7416	0.2612214	0.2934713	-0.1679	-0.174870681477	0.890108720	2089	2389	2210.4272	2290.6587	0.6953202	0.7287095	-0.0677	-0.193713017977	0.9541802!sample_table_end
