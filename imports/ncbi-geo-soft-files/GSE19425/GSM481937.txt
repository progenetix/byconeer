Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481937/suppl/GSM481937_MR363.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	9842	8122	9487.4698	8317.7644	2.1843311	1.9417142	0.1699	0.133228918465	1.12494992	3390	3612	3313.76	3723.1215	0.6843421	0.794074	-0.2146	-0.117815008111	0.86181153	6536	5207	6303.8249	5365.1104	1.6746102	1.3684299	0.2913	-0.0146628657842	1.22374574	8166	7751	7879.0149	7946.0227	1.7779439	1.8388379	-0.0486	-0.187904183541	0.96688455	21174	20522	20649.783	20781.456	4.0411211	4.0644871	-0.0083	-0.170616982921	0.99425126	11327	9387	10945.377	9575.6422	2.6136215	2.2222647	0.2340	0.0750684296915	1.17610727	2551	2509	2526.5632	2565.843	0.6118389	0.60072	0.0265	-0.0106322727361	1.01850928	2935	2924	2885.5096	2996.4033	0.6080315	0.6524036	-0.1016	-0.00895690380615	0.93198679	11200	11138	10819.036	11342.47	2.180139	2.3355622	-0.0993	0.00190655958253	0.933453610	12224	11338	11836.773	11546.145	2.4297282	2.4728418	-0.0254	-0.101909250799	0.982565111	35151	30105	34134.067	30649.243	7.5375	7.1086428	0.0845	-0.0221580277368	1.06032912	11954	9986	11568.508	10180.287	2.5592358	2.2723899	0.1715	-0.116632760629	1.12623113	9669	10264	9320.0306	10463.184	2.0566935	2.3285514	-0.1791	-0.105457072269	0.883250214	14057	15529	13643.727	15733.305	2.6774415	3.0330276	-0.1799	-0.206451804122	0.88276215	7848	7763	7571.9013	7958.1035	1.6287022	1.7621448	-0.1136	-0.0526342542454	0.924272616	4424	5479	4293.083	5640.6277	0.9154196	1.1947757	-0.3842	-0.174479901693	0.766185317	4713	4233	4563.3781	4369.7354	0.9252733	0.9270887	-0.0028	0.0373414534308	0.998041818	11344	11137	10962.29	11341.454	2.0699162	2.0616462	0.0058	0.004612704672	1.004011419	5844	5768	5637.4494	5935.1878	1.351698	1.4679514	-0.1190	-0.0690398253621	0.920805720	3498	2672	3415.7464	2734.534	0.7557335	0.6254241	0.2730	0.0579287689951	1.2083536!sample_table_end
