Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481933/suppl/GSM481933_MR359.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6505	5846	6586.1273	5730.8918	1.3760594	1.1915578	0.2077	0.15214550927	1.15484072	5669	5341	5760.9481	5229.7538	1.3848232	1.2818008	0.1115	0.0452276688087	1.08037313	7027	5139	7098.871	5028.2349	1.4020716	1.0006155	0.4867	0.0830214727912	1.40120924	13893	12735	13802.923	12664.027	2.5941813	2.3736365	0.1282	-0.0995217825255	1.09291435	21983	19724	21712.313	19727.757	4.9873005	4.5779551	0.1236	-0.104680190531	1.08941676	12020	11461	11983.224	11372.234	2.4547444	2.3473675	0.0645	-0.00967681172538	1.04574357	3606	3505	3710.0249	3406.6278	0.8100087	0.7637443	0.0848	0.0185621087962	1.06057588	3954	4267	4055.2317	4161.7329	0.6825381	0.7286189	-0.0943	-0.00527500714691	0.93675599	6759	7274	6837.7534	7159.8517	1.5734363	1.6686831	-0.0848	0.00918576485835	0.94292110	17074	13929	16896.444	13880.515	2.8098962	2.4120193	0.2203	0.0209160423449	1.16495611	41180	38652	40752.735	38484.067	6.9130975	6.8406106	0.0152	-0.056810394417	1.010596612	14451	12865	14348.129	12796.113	2.7440913	2.4948858	0.1374	-0.133706758695	1.099886613	9797	9095	9807.3507	8996.0067	1.8275675	1.712906	0.0935	0.0308352315971	1.066939714	14719	14780	14608.214	14745.354	3.8327736	3.9438596	-0.0412	-0.137109707332	0.971833215	7613	7248	7670.2874	7134.1353	1.3208185	1.250301	0.0792	0.0437489068026	1.056400416	4947	5405	5049.2052	5293.6213	0.9505869	1.0159327	-0.0959	-0.0303197337747	0.93567917	2902	2586	3006.7313	2499.0861	0.6958301	0.5994519	0.2151	0.146300955942	1.160777218	6328	6663	6410.4644	6546.6068	1.3940748	1.4106807	-0.0171	-0.00681694461478	0.988228419	4442	4297	4548.6748	4190.7393	1.0450104	0.9905856	0.0772	0.0290577470366	1.054942120	5076	4641	5177.1528	4529.7358	0.7071782	0.6404771	0.1429	-0.00712930825113	1.1041427!sample_table_end
