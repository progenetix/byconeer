Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481921/suppl/GSM481921_MR345.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3885	3639	3718.3844	3746.3188	1.1924954	1.2504195	-0.0684	0.0140842979732	0.95367622	3027	2301	2916.953	2373.5781	1.1568444	0.9774337	0.2431	0.111024900397	1.18355273	3781	2727	3619.6058	2806.0317	1.0716952	0.8506598	0.3332	0.0063054932169	1.25983994	12884	13113	11866.351	13768.097	3.6179128	4.2111633	-0.2191	-0.273142509594	0.85912435	20701	18062	18621.129	19112.248	7.2777095	7.382721	-0.0207	-0.176792216568	0.9857766	18551	12659	16785.241	13280.295	5.5837303	4.5871529	0.2836	0.09987378241	1.2172547	2219	1759	2139.8905	1823.3904	1.3518377	1.087782	0.3135	0.132904364711	1.24274688	3399	3234	3261.2464	3331.8447	1.1055307	1.1634201	-0.0736	0.00503601617089	0.95024219	3351	4083	3217.0698	4205.4686	1.240089	1.6710657	-0.4303	-0.163580952085	0.742094710	12555	8807	11575.008	9169.1775	4.9252207	3.9654605	0.3127	0.0671283145277	1.242029911	5492	9479	5211.0643	9889.3245	2.0489245	3.9278077	-0.9389	-0.533842741295	0.521645812	5716	6153	5420.4843	6371.4997	2.9414866	3.2238025	-0.1322	-0.26849309221	0.912427613	2116	1888	2040.8397	1951.5111	1.391293	1.2969091	0.1013	0.0347702855307	1.072775914	9937	9804	9241.1892	10229.385	5.1609677	5.9356943	-0.2018	-0.217387610083	0.8694815	1758	1674	1700.6779	1737.6104	0.7533112	0.7453688	0.0153	0.0118163452117	1.010655716	1351	1714	1303.1121	1778.1034	0.7166965	0.9299174	-0.3757	-0.170232694379	0.770709817	1256	780	1210.231	850.8541	0.4549111	0.3424122	0.4099	0.24368053475	1.32854818	5030	4553	4780.0264	4697.5072	2.1343058	2.05922	0.0517	0.0275593366621	1.036463219	2050	1895	1977.25	1958.4196	0.7222227	0.7564932	-0.0669	-0.0429657993272	0.954698220	2668	2565	2571.3619	2641.2683	0.9187839	0.9887835	-0.1059	-0.131557138703	0.9292063!sample_table_end
