Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481845/suppl/GSM481845_MR229.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5128	4630	5208.8682	4532.4192	1.3619223	1.1628708	0.2280	0.163696058859	1.17117242	5892	5764	5972.0537	5638.6592	1.4216119	1.3402959	0.0850	0.221187391519	1.06067023	4207	4031	4283.6194	3944.6297	1.444477	1.3101616	0.1408	0.0929065562257	1.10251824	10622	9559	10553.095	9431.4661	3.5459245	3.1380234	0.1763	0.125839790131	1.12998675	10629	8813	10559.799	8685.1942	4.0811444	3.2723336	0.3187	0.180521410962	1.24716646	6671	6848	6734.6077	6722.0696	2.3480805	2.3343028	0.0085	-0.00729977624511	1.00590237	3398	3669	3476.25	3583.2407	0.8292454	0.7898189	0.0703	0.0217322835383	1.04991848	2474	2449	2551.394	2388.0219	0.7510974	0.7201998	0.0606	0.052216518563	1.04290139	7440	7405	7482.0375	7280.8125	1.627136	1.5886546	0.0345	0.0168334560897	1.024222710	12363	12119	12220.749	12013.662	3.2896292	3.3249308	-0.0154	-0.0279934894912	0.989382711	19107	18159	18602.634	18170.873	5.1326424	5.1243233	0.0023	0.01307401094	1.001623512	12101	12787	11966.14	12691.11	2.8188268	3.0793432	-0.1275	0.0858546811691	0.915398713	8883	8441	8885.1055	8316.2415	1.8521258	1.7859492	0.0525	0.0895320483507	1.03705414	12130	11683	11994.337	11569.766	3.0479079	2.9355837	0.0542	0.139488224413	1.03826315	5356	5033	5436.5746	4927.0268	1.2602531	1.1624876	0.1165	0.138731128253	1.084100316	5044	5396	5124.944	5282.3754	1.1867523	1.1910771	-0.0052	0.121645008234	0.99636917	2207	2217	2278.9533	2161.0139	0.5451812	0.5206304	0.0665	-0.0401120604078	1.047155918	4389	4097	4468.7386	4011.4169	1.5364107	1.3842152	0.1505	0.0848180801319	1.109950719	4506	4209	4587.3156	4122.8062	1.0812639	0.9802459	0.1415	0.101907264316	1.103053820	3212	3054	3289.0792	2981.8366	0.8151938	0.7646136	0.0924	0.100899625743	1.0661513!sample_table_end
