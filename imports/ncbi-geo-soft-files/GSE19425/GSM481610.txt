Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481610/suppl/GSM481610_EL676.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3712	3059	3757.4896	3030.4059	0.817561	0.6722552	-0.2823	-0.126402753626	0.82226912	4262	4989	4313.5083	4893.9602	1.3022305	1.2776187	-0.0275	0.0601536617497	0.98110023	3843	3206	3890.3909	3176.1349	0.7333492	0.7103619	-0.0459	0.0480479532954	0.96865444	25333	16345	24620.737	15721.876	4.7005885	3.5371212	-0.4103	-0.282276056096	0.75248475	21866	22570	21380.914	21706.598	4.3753195	5.159589	0.2379	-0.374423046475	1.17924856	12208	9276	12156.446	8999.2331	2.5973693	2.1986193	-0.2405	-0.225729403294	0.84647927	3823	4791	3870.1011	4702.4107	1.0812166	1.204788	0.1561	-0.246735213052	1.11428928	3577	3171	3622.6828	3141.4348	0.729518	0.7105785	-0.0379	-0.144817449294	0.97403839	3115	3452	3152.0312	3415.5705	0.927115	0.8457578	-0.1325	-0.0986429782411	0.912246910	18655	18264	18347.582	17549.076	5.0082049	4.4991132	-0.1547	-0.175750983185	0.898348411	14974	14552	14829.418	14007.818	3.568916	3.3877311	-0.0752	-0.167218537281	0.949232512	8830	7295	8852.517	7099.3179	2.4569801	1.7900571	-0.4569	-0.155300595949	0.728559813	2279	2882	2315.6718	2857.3821	0.7922001	0.7564607	-0.0666	-0.0630794080816	0.954885814	7135	6476	7160.3638	6319.3966	2.3853465	1.7839519	-0.4191	-0.273553122787	0.747879615	3187	3108	3226.8595	3078.9822	0.7727609	0.7143334	-0.1134	0.0331252514197	0.924391316	2906	3946	2937.1239	3890.4057	0.7832557	0.9350521	0.2556	0.0481235840732	1.193801817	657	785	661.9987	831.7205	0.1861099	0.207571	0.1574	-0.00536624723311	1.115313918	6661	5066	6695.0454	4968.4174	1.5269685	1.2320836	-0.3096	-0.182232111887	0.806882119	1906	2089	1948.3098	2103.5175	0.5573514	0.5242128	-0.0884	0.0221345481154	0.940542620	3540	2826	3585.8183	2803.1096	0.8793663	0.6742481	-0.3832	-0.100845178515	0.7667431!sample_table_end
