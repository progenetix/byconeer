Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481902/suppl/GSM481902_MR316.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4645	3999	4457.6123	4138.749	1.4303193	1.2159313	-0.2343	0.201917103399	0.85011172	3917	4763	3776.9116	4953.5757	1.3583049	1.5063355	0.1492	0.14788496355	1.10898193	4422	3383	4251.6097	3504.9583	1.1770055	0.9572748	-0.2981	0.101644429001	0.81331374	13279	9897	12302.604	10393.26	3.0745284	2.6745487	-0.2011	-0.102324716795	0.86990535	16626	12902	15301.526	13623.379	4.6658722	4.229567	-0.1416	-0.255446561958	0.90649016	9321	7898	8750.7005	8283.9302	2.6137276	2.4269277	-0.1070	-0.13463333865	0.92853127	3025	3114	2929.3025	3226.6041	0.9289776	0.9419983	0.0201	-0.148836713239	1.01401618	4083	3678	3935.1348	3815.2494	0.8421667	0.8296453	-0.0216	-0.00710524107479	0.98513199	4552	5633	4371.757	5867.5962	1.4870893	1.6303956	0.1327	-0.0204706332427	1.09636710	18303	17348	16793.487	18358.522	3.0073879	3.7028393	0.3001	-0.123678324311	1.231247611	29023	18015	26411.424	19064.971	5.4122086	4.5004005	-0.2662	-0.25620821272	0.831527512	15001	11559	13835.145	12183.186	3.174722	2.8279721	-0.1669	-0.257714575951	0.890777813	12617	10838	11704.015	11408.908	1.9066594	2.0319506	0.0918	-0.0131959916389	1.065712414	11592	12162	10774.75	12830.769	4.0271729	4.3230965	0.1023	-0.142027967519	1.073481715	6301	6193	5989.7184	6452.0974	1.1638725	1.3346118	0.1975	0.0581049078954	1.146699316	4417	4677	4246.9859	4864.357	1.0552344	1.1699982	0.1489	-0.0606694015023	1.108756617	1813	2279	1776.1688	2363.1826	0.6558253	0.7496911	0.1930	-0.0240090860196	1.143126118	4291	3988	4130.2716	4127.8144	1.6144916	1.6286804	0.0126	0.016562213113	1.008788319	3582	3837	3462.5983	3977.5891	1.2069358	1.1823895	-0.0296	-0.0100155957734	0.979662220	4594	3652	4410.5435	3788.3868	0.7656634	0.7030267	-0.1231	0.0866166646666	0.9181928!sample_table_end
