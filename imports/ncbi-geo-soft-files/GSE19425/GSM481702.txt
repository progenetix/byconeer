Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481702/suppl/GSM481702_JBH106.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	402	577	453.9689	536.1581	0.9188369	0.9030838	-0.0249	-0.0469898602166	0.98285532	361	705	400.6114	639.5647	1.132765	1.4535011	0.3597	0.345354587161	1.28314443	786	991	895.3003	868.432	1.0480218	0.9768625	-0.1014	-0.109710197019	0.93210134	2772	2933	2919.9004	2506.3336	2.9454901	2.9517678	0.0031	0.0073411990685	1.00213135	7283	8018	7047.3832	7160.9716	7.5574711	6.7337999	-0.1665	-0.0273115656552	0.89101236	1524	2186	1674.9749	1867.3982	2.3753684	2.2827206	-0.0574	-0.0456423848485	0.96099647	1460	1403	1608.3969	1211.5891	1.2652826	0.8176452	-0.6299	-0.30640704692	0.64621548	1243	858	1384.69	763.7739	0.9239224	0.728707	-0.3424	-0.152383534194	0.78871019	412	557	466.4942	519.6345	1.3134048	1.1688162	-0.1683	-0.0545607109572	0.889913110	4166	4572	4235.313	3951.4973	2.5498467	3.0950831	0.2796	0.0269749423265	1.21383111	8569	5767	8173.5717	5053.8734	5.1936727	4.3933317	-0.2414	-0.22439058094	0.845900712	2438	3087	2593.5865	2639.4717	1.6483101	1.8492062	0.1659	-0.0160035541581	1.1218813	1992	2630	2152.2841	2250.011	1.2343258	1.4706405	0.2527	-0.0913676344611	1.191452314	601	1410	690.2399	1217.2316	2.2041281	2.762675	0.3259	-0.0222675277937	1.253409415	2370	2516	2526.4752	2152.4504	1.4575758	1.5541154	0.0925	-0.0167904637503	1.06623316	1155	1676	1292.8763	1440.1464	0.810235	0.9322833	0.2024	-0.0164027336886	1.150633217	220	273	189.9471	289.4005	0.4956188	0.6223781	0.3286	0.0592382788888	1.255759718	650	1220	744.6108	1061.3633	1.1904829	1.2325235	0.0501	-0.10549145174	1.035313919	361	483	400.6114	459.6402	0.9578303	0.9832377	0.0378	-0.211558937759	1.026525920	908	716	1028.8376	648.6335	0.6756109	0.5189242	-0.3807	-0.101891786194	0.7680815!sample_table_end
