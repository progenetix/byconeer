Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481838/suppl/GSM481838_MR162.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5139	4045	4926.1529	4204.5182	1.0936398	0.9196846	-0.2499	-0.2375676997	0.84093922	6294	5375	6012.181	5573.3761	1.3824173	1.2533827	-0.1414	-0.0907697815224	0.90666013	5184	3417	4967.0766	3563.3565	1.0909331	0.789325	-0.4669	-0.211349616013	0.7235324	14307	9822	13396.739	10165.579	2.9575863	2.2056269	-0.4232	-0.23051278319	0.74575235	20284	14843	18650.596	15439.181	4.0781507	3.3549513	-0.2816	-0.118041155706	0.82266486	10399	7787	9813.3197	8049.7306	2.3408142	1.9170394	-0.2881	-0.234159875906	0.81896267	4067	3208	3902.5309	3349.9546	0.8237804	0.6959003	-0.2434	-0.193493747609	0.84476438	3065	2348	2963.3489	2457.3129	0.6744	0.5651959	-0.2549	-0.335824317984	0.83807229	8288	5631	7859.9149	5830.3352	1.6813736	1.2065731	-0.4787	-0.369304266601	0.717611510	18117	12550	16753.48	13005.062	4.0652331	3.2363023	-0.3290	-0.350838365764	0.796092611	21596	16841	19794.112	17567.16	4.7827553	4.3304676	-0.1433	-0.24585873726	0.905433612	11137	9673	10504.065	10009.122	2.5073753	2.3853842	-0.0720	-0.199209015116	0.951347113	7491	4592	7125.0514	4771.3047	1.7995818	1.2311459	-0.5477	-0.567417324239	0.684128814	15089	11483	14090.082	11886.909	3.0605304	2.5764101	-0.2484	-0.199743921193	0.841818115	5757	4380	5494.918	4552.0162	1.2588087	1.0428887	-0.2715	-0.104531866053	0.828472616	5082	4098	4874.2993	4260.3524	1.1369821	0.9624533	-0.2404	-0.360114821171	0.846498117	2786	1773	2703.8178	1857.3686	0.6145962	0.4109453	-0.5807	-0.493337739449	0.668642718	7802	6067	7410.4782	6279.1708	1.4192804	1.1636647	-0.2865	-0.30911421982	0.819897619	4714	4014	4524.3305	4171.866	1.0271234	0.9012694	-0.1886	-0.219765519478	0.877469420	2980	2280	2882.6973	2385.8491	0.7385693	0.6351853	-0.2176	-0.297488196114	0.8600211!sample_table_end
