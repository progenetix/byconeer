Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481573/suppl/GSM481573_EL635.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2205	2149	2365.4803	1992.6191	0.8277714	0.7045371	0.2326	0.0219083502589	1.17491512	1808	1852	1945.4134	1723.7701	0.7474791	0.690146	0.1151	0.114016204162	1.08307373	3176	3176	3385.1141	2938.3258	1.2781494	1.0664549	0.2612	0.123438419367	1.19850294	14851	13527	15000.316	12678.94	7.0322638	5.9348363	0.2448	0.086675763742	1.18491285	8387	14314	8703.4356	13439.364	3.6551456	5.4952724	-0.5883	0.0256669838395	0.66514366	12215	13280	12472.114	12440.978	5.4642904	5.1996274	0.0716	0.0118163452117	1.05090037	1411	1555	1516.3044	1452.5847	0.7814561	0.8265667	-0.0810	0.240137103591	0.94542428	1851	1912	1990.3685	1777.7338	1.046627	0.9081868	0.2047	0.0553215894963	1.15243589	3657	4311	3889.9383	3992.7038	1.5118299	1.6539317	-0.1296	-0.138535751708	0.914082410	10558	12629	10853.439	11822.129	7.4191686	7.9208131	-0.0944	-0.0573258508727	0.936667511	5154	4631	5435.3148	4292.6163	3.7534461	2.9167427	0.3639	0.217209494486	1.286862212	8216	7571	8533.1019	7027.6246	4.8470859	4.330568	0.1626	0.0915410189411	1.119272513	1819	1791	1956.9158	1668.8482	1.4776239	1.3427444	0.1381	0.00450901467832	1.100450614	8884	8706	9199.7814	8096.6725	3.6925275	3.12845	0.2392	0.108120010581	1.180305715	1824	1715	1962.1436	1599.6812	1.1247441	0.9154463	0.2970	0.104379201916	1.228629216	2029	2278	2178.8677	2111.7223	1.1122189	1.2133751	-0.1256	0.101533230544	0.916632317	1283	1101	1378.2574	1045.024	0.4959974	0.4038641	0.2965	0.00823616324006	1.228129518	5807	5727	6100.7644	5294.4443	2.2028008	1.8639287	0.2410	0.0514476976567	1.181805219	2903	2687	3099.9926	2485.2525	1.2444605	1.0710821	0.2165	-0.00765254961162	1.161872120	2522	2629	2701.5122	2432.5833	1.9495984	1.6960596	0.2010	-0.0861202953951	1.1494869!sample_table_end
