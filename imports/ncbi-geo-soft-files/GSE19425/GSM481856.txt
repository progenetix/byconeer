Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481856/suppl/GSM481856_MR252.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	8272	6695	8045.8163	6784.2439	1.5017297	1.3039173	-0.2038	-0.169254226665	0.86827692	6070	6679	5923.3245	6768.1657	1.1726296	1.4286073	0.2849	0.081425259361	1.21829363	7804	5442	7591.6045	5537.4976	1.4198431	1.0769905	-0.3987	-0.163499140854	0.75852784	11129	11324	10786.553	11405.035	2.3633928	2.5374096	0.1025	0.191971019612	1.073635	16004	16524	15411.848	16742.235	2.9811073	3.2937367	0.1439	0.161085611169	1.10487026	11824	11237	11464.565	11317.359	2.2182763	2.2431598	0.0161	0.022433864754	1.01121747	3382	4084	3325.4165	4177.7226	0.789263	0.8342641	0.0800	0.0423935948314	1.05701668	3445	3317	3385.0754	3407.0502	0.7300221	0.7437282	0.0268	0.00778437401742	1.01877499	10718	9239	10391.456	9313.2602	2.0393	1.9490858	-0.0653	-0.173032115748	0.955762110	13051	13653	12632.75	13777.725	3.2459862	3.482225	0.1014	0.053051819716	1.072778711	20306	15638	19462.179	15820.255	4.6802473	3.7864936	-0.3057	-0.341018815973	0.80903712	7316	8599	7120.1743	8668.0821	1.7614118	1.764598	0.0026	-0.0426167526217	1.001808813	6684	8089	6511.5263	8162.4404	2.0350752	1.962959	-0.0521	-0.125372194357	0.964563314	15063	14556	14525.376	14700.578	2.7188594	2.9872357	0.1358	0.095737448105	1.098709115	6134	6282	5986.6574	6369.8593	1.4311367	1.3407525	-0.0941	-0.115326955332	0.936844416	5371	5975	5244.7077	6064.1622	1.2791777	1.2148002	-0.0745	-0.160259509239	0.949672717	4619	3128	4520.3627	3215.8429	0.8577051	0.6563683	-0.3860	-0.27920257315	0.76526118	9117	7599	8860.7522	7675.6512	1.429372	1.2509856	-0.1923	-0.203221442825	0.875199419	6787	5388	6609.3577	5483.6105	1.3634968	1.2078185	-0.1749	-0.127625111823	0.885824220	3649	2780	3579.0912	2859.6339	0.8545093	0.7255255	-0.2361	-0.198465787035	0.8490551!sample_table_end
