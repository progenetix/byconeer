Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481800/suppl/GSM481800_MR042.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5874	5439	5856.1807	5332.8964	1.5656579	1.5247632	-0.0382	-0.084353593107	0.97388012	3060	3869	3091.1361	3814.0598	0.9808043	1.0548406	0.1050	0.0796626451609	1.07548523	3521	3393	3550.2802	3355.1373	1.0812063	1.0694153	-0.0158	0.0313923729948	0.98909464	8767	8484	8664.4704	8321.7633	2.746241	2.7920755	0.0239	-0.0847295935034	1.01668995	16037	13430	15510.24	13305.929	5.8205023	4.9224184	-0.2418	-0.155494002887	0.84570336	11150	12246	10940.921	12083.765	3.452455	3.8941998	0.1737	0.232658915051	1.12795097	3426	4217	3456.5342	4155.9304	1.1297017	1.3371302	0.2432	0.225627477016	1.18361358	2145	2181	2167.4329	2170.2117	0.8803833	0.8956992	0.0249	-0.0296881057485	1.01739689	8570	9128	8474.7428	8953.6821	2.5270004	2.3987641	-0.0751	-0.0450892131446	0.949253510	15595	14058	15099.954	13949.242	4.5110096	4.669923	0.0499	-0.0409439070325	1.035227911	19847	18138	19010.631	18181.672	5.6263253	6.1075403	0.1184	0.0515622673708	1.085529112	3660	5211	3687.1226	5111.248	1.6417047	2.1010018	0.3559	0.0929618812813	1.279768313	4454	5011	4481.2044	4919.6083	1.6986576	1.798326	0.0823	0.015445758186	1.058674714	8696	10913	8596.1658	10737.811	3.2490097	3.0431543	-0.0944	-0.0356147948122	0.936640515	5134	4953	5139.6325	4865.1921	1.4902375	1.4138243	-0.0759	0.0808558753449	0.948724116	2173	2662	2195.5715	2634.5426	1.144434	1.2433337	0.1196	0.0273192653126	1.086417917	3961	6939	3987.8595	6804.0969	1.1749629	1.7923223	0.6092	0.281779068427	1.525428818	5127	7202	5132.8729	7063.0401	2.0112337	2.1779212	0.1149	0.0484266255715	1.082878219	4042	4361	4069.9738	4298.9458	1.2305327	1.2622159	0.0367	0.0710129869277	1.025747520	2569	1987	2598.5752	1979.4726	0.7359542	0.598109	-0.2992	-0.112288501046	0.8126986!sample_table_end
