Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481746/suppl/GSM481746_JBH514.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1970	1338	1733.5602	1531.2262	1.1257123	0.9511735	-0.2431	-0.0137964782193	0.84495252	1267	1231	1067.1785	1419.3545	0.7032714	0.8499492	0.2733	0.234118431346	1.20856493	2020	1223	1781.1439	1410.9593	0.9787509	0.8094797	-0.2739	0.0273814102546	0.82705384	9491	5755	9044.7138	5941.0094	4.9065063	3.3367675	-0.5562	-0.142319339572	0.680075	12566	11291	12112.667	11189.893	6.9913872	7.0288302	0.0077	-0.154973918104	1.00535566	7827	5721	7381.4678	5908.0188	4.5645227	3.8603238	-0.2417	-0.201459811234	0.84572347	2829	1499	2540.8	1696.7647	1.7824524	1.2811641	-0.4764	-0.286318999248	0.71876488	2038	1599	1798.2364	1799.3746	0.9212586	0.9298338	0.0134	0.0373154452914	1.00930819	2491	2601	2217.6336	2827.17	1.3553392	1.5589924	0.2020	0.0848870468137	1.150259910	6705	4959	6263.9431	5169.5155	3.043401	2.5284323	-0.2674	-0.257878257392	0.830791711	7897	6886	7451.7094	7024.1403	3.6228299	3.5188922	-0.0420	0.0105882304005	0.971310412	5250	3387	4852.5281	3620.973	3.1353642	2.513368	-0.3190	0.00806200657233	0.801619213	1541	1096	1330.6747	1278.1545	0.8120132	0.7822045	-0.0540	-0.105277194853	0.963290414	5786	4706	5366.0826	4923.7199	4.3099459	3.5436377	-0.2824	-0.199615316229	0.822215	1567	1015	1354.8161	1194.6454	0.8047295	0.7279713	-0.1446	-0.0719597768359	0.904616116	1192	994	998.1474	1173.0123	0.6209762	0.7912942	0.3497	0.0832766922345	1.274274717	792	608	623.2371	773.3963	0.4128181	0.4712673	0.1910	0.0595625289938	1.141585718	2861	1846	2571.3178	2058.5378	1.6436066	1.3377885	-0.2970	-0.212946798474	0.813934719	1304	1066	1101.8018	1247.1674	0.6619879	0.6727324	0.0232	0.081671218297	1.016230720	2386	1514	2120.0429	1712.114	0.9968263	0.7547694	-0.4013	0.0334683917538	0.7571724!sample_table_end
