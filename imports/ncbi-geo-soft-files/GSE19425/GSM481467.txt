Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481467/suppl/GSM481467_DE364.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2210	1439	1950.7575	1601.8971	1.1979177	1.0269933	0.2221	-0.323703431172	1.16643182	1395	1039	1261.4204	1160.3424	0.9580431	0.8792345	0.1238	0.109604877426	1.08963313	3413	1954	2935.9728	2186.8251	1.5223817	1.2714953	0.2598	-0.199963447621	1.1973164	5852	3983	4873.7369	4510.1744	2.7330592	2.3980425	0.1887	0.0783052791391	1.13970425	11480	8171	9367.8205	9219.8773	4.9114885	5.5101064	-0.1659	-0.0546311927384	0.891366	7255	4993	5999.3227	5665.8862	3.2689565	3.4834454	-0.0917	-0.0288259704431	0.93842627	446	280	370.8428	343.385	0.813361	0.7624791	0.0932	0.0165945881147	1.06673218	1232	1244	1118.8634	1387.6505	0.6291966	0.6849489	-0.1225	-0.0536815663304	0.91860379	1456	1186	1314.1112	1323.5227	0.9510244	0.9819538	-0.0462	0.0616979616553	0.968502210	2425	2242	2126.1516	2519.1612	2.0460826	2.2442049	-0.1333	-0.178522691883	0.911718211	9922	10193	8131.1066	11451.671	5.9391742	7.8469595	-0.4019	-0.256442120112	0.756875812	350	155	264.1671	218.2894	0.8896993	0.7541125	0.2385	0.217042191751	1.179796313	329	196	243.1082	258.101	0.9676995	1.0282717	-0.0876	-0.0470563511038	0.941093114	4480	3353	3793.781	3804.3023	2.8228823	3.0029845	-0.0892	-0.0168520157033	0.940025615	687	502	624.0802	570.5011	1.412488	1.3165507	0.1015	-0.216335193487	1.072870116	1112	953	1014.4201	1065.7562	2.677429	2.7934018	-0.0612	-0.134160648667	0.958483317	1337	1076	1210.941	1201.5902	0.8573221	0.8605336	-0.0054	-0.589821237564	0.99626818	2870	2146	2495.8541	2408.2289	1.3911461	1.5606855	-0.1659	-0.283366227237	0.891368519	1541	1692	1386.8058	1890.1152	1.0472624	1.3160081	-0.3295	-0.536385452361	0.795787220	1734	1077	1553.5962	1202.7051	0.6021705	0.452559	0.4121	0.0740026661366	1.3305901!sample_table_end
