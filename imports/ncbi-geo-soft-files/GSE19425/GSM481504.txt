Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481504/suppl/GSM481504_DE421.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3002	2014	2717.9451	2230.8359	1.0633769	0.846749	-0.3286	-0.10810522994	0.79628312	3387	3510	3064.087	3859.5856	0.9428483	1.198317	0.3459	0.214922668661	1.27095433	6833	5292	6323.1584	5676.5625	1.7979748	1.5745003	-0.1915	0.0395971751999	0.87570774	11241	12983	10633.125	12504.735	3.1459055	3.5934149	0.1919	0.0227792731207	1.14225145	16535	18002	15383.038	16644.137	4.4475006	4.8158882	0.1148	0.0863411087439	1.08283026	13074	9669	12352.676	9686.318	3.8174016	2.8984722	-0.3973	-0.503649409284	0.75927887	2740	2073	2479.5754	2296.2196	1.0709548	0.980632	-0.1271	-0.121560299221	0.91566148	2037	2409	1870.4594	2672.8844	0.5239209	0.7355697	0.4895	0.240984194959	1.40397089	3939	3035	3571.0347	3351.8049	1.0144058	0.9739358	-0.0587	0.116647678179	0.960104710	15561	8744	14557.952	8877.0339	4.1630938	2.4528116	-0.7632	-0.483432638535	0.5891811	24868	14624	22005.259	13867.562	5.941209	3.735947	-0.6693	-0.397108371887	0.628819312	12257	14626	11594.099	13869.215	4.0309106	4.8310119	0.2612	-0.0492569885445	1.198491413	6895	3928	6384.1754	4306.4139	2.0493012	1.3947451	-0.5551	-0.151519422853	0.680595514	14020	11596	13215.747	11348.497	4.7155743	4.083696	-0.2076	-0.14588926108	0.866001815	6330	4695	5830.819	5080.9265	1.6311427	1.4048146	-0.2155	0.0707230327471	0.861245716	3723	2486	3374.6577	2758.3517	1.2112372	0.9758649	-0.3117	-0.106317115517	0.805676217	2864	1889	2593.3391	2095.4226	0.7870817	0.6268364	-0.3284	0.0436180380044	0.796405818	4981	3416	4522.3849	3759.3176	1.9924011	1.6309875	-0.2888	-0.186182762632	0.81860419	5246	3230	4773.6031	3560.4963	1.2849172	0.979643	-0.3913	-0.0449338522717	0.762417220	2017	1538	1853.4289	1704.6131	0.5793382	0.5333041	-0.1194	-0.0610633145979	0.9205402!sample_table_end
