Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481750/suppl/GSM481750_JBH520.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1220	984	1191.5442	1014.5469	0.9656715	0.7883164	-0.2928	-0.00613232101004	0.81634012	1164	1292	1135.2805	1316.9296	1.0081634	1.1210237	0.1531	0.119242749192	1.11194653	1214	1171	1185.5125	1197.3155	0.7562186	0.7661296	0.0188	0.159666899469	1.0131064	10284	7837	10100.129	7588.8466	6.332076	4.8242696	-0.3924	-0.0111404882664	0.7618785	12628	11002	12329.784	10616.093	8.676609	7.5511058	-0.2004	-0.236940307552	0.8702836	6681	5519	6616.7933	5375.0047	4.8439837	3.917373	-0.3063	-0.268008658404	0.80870897	2131	1980	2114.3107	1978.8488	1.4214113	1.2635441	-0.1698	-0.129595491189	0.88893638	1876	1767	1856.4291	1773.4158	0.9845618	0.9845833	0.0000	-0.0785219580858	1.00002189	1671	1570	1651.9983	1586.2254	1.3609856	1.2464807	-0.1268	-0.0247700089246	0.915866210	8226	7007	8114.8076	6797.5073	4.4135541	3.8644658	-0.1917	-0.140257517257	0.875590411	7090	6392	7012.6146	6215.4457	3.5803338	3.4420579	-0.0568	0.0246481847332	0.96137912	5410	4685	5369.0209	4573.0672	2.9224664	2.5979133	-0.1698	0.164859504963	0.888945413	1700	1779	1681.1458	1784.97	0.9084578	0.9797618	0.1090	0.0887745880282	1.07848914	3616	3687	3598.1023	3619.2296	3.847427	3.4347398	-0.1637	-0.120201276971	0.892736815	1904	1672	1884.4906	1682.8035	0.9118916	0.8538539	-0.0949	0.0109593947832	0.936354616	1378	1899	1354.9815	1900.5936	0.7259304	1.0300963	0.5049	0.248085563417	1.419001317	378	296	330.8176	349.0418	0.2966227	0.2983182	0.0082	-0.0175866527241	1.005715718	1904	1856	1884.4906	1859.0344	1.6075844	1.4516635	-0.1472	-0.0622337697486	0.903009119	682	602	646.9102	646.6065	0.5515931	0.5370834	-0.0385	0.0248183654416	0.973694820	2022	1467	2004.1415	1487.0863	1.0948192	0.8493438	-0.3663	0.0440233428098	0.7757845!sample_table_end
