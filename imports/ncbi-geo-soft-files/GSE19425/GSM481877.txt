Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481877/suppl/GSM481877_MR289.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2935	2434	2657.2498	2656.3035	1.2591888	1.2524906	0.0077	-0.0374486524797	1.00534782	3950	2814	3603.3665	3045.268	1.7593631	1.5565151	0.1767	-0.0346405664006	1.13032193	2132	1569	1896.2538	1771.2422	0.8768108	0.7915885	0.1475	0.0172845591143	1.10765984	11629	8260	10635.549	8696.2754	5.0382622	4.0631459	0.3103	0.0961436254962	1.23999045	20635	18483	18488.257	19443.034	9.2314408	9.2425226	-0.0017	-0.0912953195792	0.9988016	8815	9023	8084.6049	9487.2889	4.0436103	4.6400033	-0.1985	-0.103660112625	0.87146717	2150	1807	1912.896	2013.6671	1.0685288	1.0378253	0.0421	0.00169330694069	1.02958438	2349	2078	2099.0277	2288.018	1.0731984	1.1956382	-0.1559	-0.0460538429732	0.89759469	4733	3642	4338.3066	3909.7839	1.955693	1.838353	0.0893	0.165703982968	1.063828810	10198	6504	9351.5928	6872.6512	5.3814561	4.1656595	0.3695	0.19106002017	1.291861711	4331	5116	3963.8507	5422.2991	2.1633656	3.0760746	-0.5078	-0.547831438465	0.703287712	5208	4056	4779.2834	4332.7909	2.861817	2.5371182	0.1737	-0.0748209488096	1.127979313	1920	1520	1688.6819	1719.9735	1.1284556	1.1664941	-0.0478	0.06271165907	0.967390714	12328	9645	11256.725	10136.247	5.8920084	5.2801173	0.1582	0.014352293311	1.115885815	1369	1091	1153.251	1284.8603	0.6841793	0.753563	-0.1394	-0.0668937826343	0.907925816	1796	1624	1567.0412	1827.7664	0.8377957	0.9220376	-0.1382	0.0883400046881	0.90863517	830	439	617.731	613.4735	0.3140068	0.3266854	-0.0571	-0.0393965415454	0.961190118	3275	3041	2972.8271	3283.1499	1.6417721	1.6916036	-0.0431	-0.0303194833077	0.970541819	1461	888	1242.5231	1084.6361	0.6459704	0.5907232	0.1290	0.0468408128457	1.093524620	2612	1751	2351.1325	1957.0417	1.2975293	1.2019915	0.1103	0.124280882657	1.0794829!sample_table_end
