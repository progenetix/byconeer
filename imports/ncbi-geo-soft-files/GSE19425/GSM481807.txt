Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481807/suppl/GSM481807_MR059.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6135	5783	6097.0129	5774.1986	1.4709347	1.3343057	0.1406	0.0644945405798	1.10239712	4079	4685	4072.4431	4683.3541	1.0493961	1.1233616	-0.0983	-0.0279153246942	0.93415713	4762	3979	4742.2219	3981.5285	1.1361358	0.9358055	0.2799	0.0345683153796	1.21407264	10465	10322	10357.243	10236.314	2.5377618	2.5040603	0.0193	-0.0256475808486	1.01345875	14656	15059	14487.221	14913.307	3.6012445	3.6802508	-0.0313	-0.224981225557	0.97853246	9039	9155	8957.6621	9086.4895	2.2590979	2.2611688	-0.0013	0.0242500252755	0.99908427	2473	2639	2518.7492	2616.9513	0.5900006	0.7088382	-0.2647	-0.205459049354	0.83234888	2384	2436	2433.1703	2410.0657	0.5868839	0.5900916	-0.0079	0.105073923423	0.9945649	7351	8153	7303.414	8097.6918	1.8463255	1.8586109	-0.0096	-0.0362029408412	0.9933910	12138	12743	12002.244	12626.92	3.0497518	3.2892388	-0.1091	-0.119432198756	0.927190811	20523	20329	20279.291	20153.452	5.2404618	5.3143443	-0.0202	-0.166560145401	0.986097512	8278	7543	8208.4033	7503.1882	1.8621213	1.8656154	-0.0027	0.200525194596	0.998127113	9310	8649	9223.1928	8586.2602	2.2350994	2.3114956	-0.0485	-0.0416770186524	0.966949414	12419	12717	12276.012	12600.792	3.0959908	3.0109289	0.0402	0.00711482306751	1.02825115	6766	6034	6724.7113	6021.7064	1.49979	1.3698353	0.1308	0.118105454297	1.094868816	4806	4498	4785.007	4495.3081	1.0678087	1.1345479	-0.0875	0.0490510642208	0.941175517	2255	2460	2308.4891	2434.6117	0.5735941	0.5690192	0.0116	-0.139947056083	1.0080418	7009	6951	6966.3681	6918.7043	1.5247068	1.512135	0.0119	0.0530194182137	1.00831419	4899	5163	4876.2474	5163.1991	1.2925213	1.2504805	0.0477	-0.0349884127092	1.033619820	2559	2828	2601.1613	2807.2054	0.5743137	0.6324492	-0.1391	-0.101408001616	0.9080787!sample_table_end
