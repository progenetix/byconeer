Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481913/suppl/GSM481913_MR327.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5651	4502	5539.0874	4563.9918	1.35957	1.1003782	0.3052	0.200874050822	1.23554782	6302	6228	6171.4658	6339.4912	1.8503716	1.844314	0.0047	-0.00817175871582	1.00328443	3986	3168	3931.5937	3210.762	0.9538909	0.7717388	0.3057	-0.00745899649291	1.23602814	20699	17488	19594.556	18161.899	4.2310346	3.9858834	0.0861	-0.120556404635	1.06150485	21885	19872	20704.03	20645.923	5.1501285	5.0448445	0.0298	-0.151558843838	1.02086966	9651	8433	9331.1208	8623.3027	2.5016402	2.3171486	0.1105	0.0133206096791	1.07962017	2691	2942	2659.0814	2979.7415	0.7146744	0.802896	-0.1679	-0.107825256599	0.89012078	4212	4125	4153.2758	4183.029	0.802192	0.862282	-0.1042	-0.0102536768192	0.93031279	3573	4040	3528.2833	4095.297	1.0003325	1.1095966	-0.1496	-0.0231964441889	0.90152810	15432	12724	14709.679	13155.676	3.0761141	2.9918074	0.0401	-0.0691758422429	1.028179111	23635	20510	22333.084	21298.167	4.4736127	4.614401	-0.0447	-0.0867655271584	0.969489312	13133	11939	12586.548	12329.972	2.8806574	2.9401033	-0.0295	-0.217118526698	0.97978113	6742	6276	6598.2168	6389.1515	1.5454716	1.5811443	-0.0329	-0.0323650382712	0.977438714	10762	10754	10368.114	11072.856	3.8589353	3.7761323	0.0313	-0.100853254652	1.02192815	5437	4521	5333.5678	4583.1221	1.0653632	0.9720835	0.1322	0.07026717454	1.095958616	3644	3933	3598.1435	3984.3926	0.8297828	0.9448778	-0.1874	-0.0760594848904	0.878190617	1309	1127	1302.3922	1164.3529	0.367812	0.3285504	0.1629	0.120182443604	1.119499718	4429	4674	4360.2734	4737.4123	1.4152177	1.4540458	-0.0390	-0.0177995347772	0.973296419	2844	2808	2809.2193	2844.1218	0.7482711	0.7608914	-0.0241	-0.0215889048918	0.983413720	4043	3718	3987.8215	3764.3401	0.7550719	0.7788935	-0.0448	-0.100998663797	0.969416!sample_table_end
