Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481870/suppl/GSM481870_MR280.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4413	3902	4322.4524	3966.146	1.1416875	0.9609533	-0.2486	-0.105862010442	0.84169552	5682	5758	5520.7927	5848.8133	1.8686867	1.6485972	-0.1808	-0.0334243697315	0.88222233	4515	3405	4420.2874	3471.8966	0.9704004	0.7583668	-0.3557	-0.136619330363	0.78149884	21582	14724	19796.283	14770.124	4.0866267	3.1349484	-0.3825	-0.255566359863	0.76712375	26211	21552	23897.055	21311.089	5.5119014	4.7772398	-0.2064	-0.162987744029	0.86671356	11999	11048	11248.001	11162.725	2.7238649	2.6524496	-0.0383	-0.0662916641466	0.97378167	3234	3389	3192.3693	3455.5026	0.9065504	0.9199006	0.0211	0.0425139286911	1.01472628	4881	3848	4770.745	3912.8687	0.9460838	0.8337885	-0.1823	-0.17568842422	0.88130519	3578	4640	3524.2847	4721.9366	1.0600152	1.222343	0.2056	0.0530498728652	1.153137210	19572	14001	18012.847	14071.913	3.7954657	3.4589635	-0.1339	-0.103211237714	0.911340911	18351	10602	16913.856	10714.468	3.3734833	2.4778732	-0.4451	-0.519256127423	0.734514712	14365	9578	13351.549	9688.5908	3.3090944	2.4582218	-0.4288	-0.23308296556	0.742868413	5386	4329	5245.553	4398.4042	1.3293181	1.2531847	-0.0851	-0.0619644701224	0.942727514	10199	11161	9626.8817	11274.99	3.8869583	3.4503755	-0.1719	-0.0782903295159	0.8876815	3414	2889	3364.0123	2948.9653	0.7181386	0.6855858	-0.0669	-0.0114679679815	0.954670516	3061	3002	3026.4376	3062.6993	0.7774402	0.7523947	-0.0472	-0.136357506806	0.967784717	1085	1218	1079.2505	1294.1938	0.3625634	0.3745608	0.0470	0.0666839921963	1.033090318	5875	5614	5700.0084	5705.1858	1.5783014	1.3635813	-0.2110	-0.255782937561	0.863954919	2046	2171	2054.3497	2234.3672	0.6471097	0.6238817	-0.0527	-0.143961443184	0.96410520	5130	4035	5005.9479	4100.307	0.9539196	0.9074507	-0.0720	-0.0160164644869	0.9512863!sample_table_end
