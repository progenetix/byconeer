Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481751/suppl/GSM481751_JBH521.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1775	2134	1965.6178	1910.1142	0.8960011	0.8373627	0.0976	0.0043260649209	1.07002742	1880	2680	2079.7882	2390.6971	1.0843666	1.13407	-0.0647	-0.0177863893936	0.95617253	1047	1097	1172.835	990.9962	0.7518043	0.6203853	0.2772	0.197785141569	1.21183444	6326	5747	6585.1287	5158.4496	4.0308649	3.1577418	0.3522	-0.0798456168549	1.27650235	7892	11473	8095.3213	10428.476	6.4888191	8.1275684	-0.3249	-0.284805071674	0.79837156	6457	7616	6713.8241	6868.0712	4.8496386	4.8546157	-0.0015	-0.0687633209503	0.99897477	1196	1548	1335.5523	1388.215	0.9934384	1.1260858	-0.1808	-0.19030303747	0.88220498	1558	2178	1729.2901	1948.9779	0.9953239	1.1517014	-0.2105	-0.204905824071	0.86422049	2367	3575	2592.5491	3201.1586	1.0699573	1.2984778	-0.2793	-0.227744581318	0.824008910	2979	4339	3218.727	3896.3726	2.4269031	3.1237145	-0.3641	-0.232531149808	0.776928611	5884	6958	6142.7933	6264.0925	4.2632352	4.5754605	-0.1020	-0.0697238385033	0.931760912	3724	3574	3984.7042	3200.2581	2.6005419	2.3359424	0.1548	-0.0640288932942	1.113273113	1106	1439	1237.5675	1290.9315	0.8496204	1.0008819	-0.2364	-0.124882297775	0.848871714	4070	6233	4332.667	5601.3721	3.1380194	3.5012203	-0.1580	-0.241327117269	0.896264415	728	885	818.0286	810.4436	0.4913759	0.528309	-0.1046	0.00503184692824	0.930091916	935	1308	1047.3402	1176.634	0.6984321	0.8577652	-0.2965	-0.0180401456683	0.814246217	514	648	571.683	606.2349	0.2969391	0.2911284	0.0285	0.107231892242	1.019959418	858	1504	961.9773	1348.3609	0.8749303	1.0666463	-0.2858	-0.18153802131	0.820262819	1002	1354	1122.6214	1216.9379	0.5728289	0.5879628	-0.0376	0.0685182449059	0.974260520	1863	2018	2061.6852	1807.6726	0.9564381	0.8754951	0.1276	-0.124873551133	1.0924538!sample_table_end
