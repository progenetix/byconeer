Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481469/suppl/GSM481469_DE366.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1296	1078	1080.3518	1270.5975	1.2269628	1.384507	-0.1743	-0.204127712732	0.88620922	604	500	550.29545	569.90162	0.9062114	0.725583	0.3207	0.177148574915	1.24894243	2529	1286	1962.6489	1527.4975	1.5527237	1.4838727	0.0654	-0.147159817505	1.04639954	3484	1731	2631.1478	2088.6292	2.2214869	2.0286165	0.1310	0.251174446272	1.09507485	9160	3586	6600.4573	4379.3098	4.9977022	4.3693633	0.1938	0.389552494871	1.14380556	4107	2402	3064.4785	2908.507	2.5041829	2.9869417	-0.2543	-0.161951967775	0.83837697	1700	1050	1378.21	1235.2063	1.0424707	1.1223941	-0.1066	0.016763011975	0.9287928	835	575	735.52148	659.04342	0.6306583	0.601504	0.0683	0.0604139269503	1.0484699	1019	919	874.06541	1070.7011	1.2550033	1.2590555	-0.0047	-0.137816013597	0.996781610	4413	4236	3276.9687	5191.0898	3.3408682	4.7477834	-0.5070	-0.243496012263	0.70366911	10566	8305	7569.2083	10487.099	7.3616964	9.9454054	-0.4340	-0.236511937099	0.740210812	2302	1222	1803.8598	1449.6971	1.5202304	1.3385548	0.1836	0.313911950239	1.135725213	1857	1899	1489.2421	2291.608	1.9048781	2.2899065	-0.2656	-0.322658499845	0.831858414	2312	1910	1810.9657	2304.8187	2.5601656	2.8582599	-0.1589	0.130222128284	0.895707715	2830	1741	2171.7282	2100.6508	1.7882203	1.821038	-0.0262	-0.283674368798	0.981978516	1839	1225	1476.461	1453.3045	1.130842	1.2689451	-0.1662	-0.274763270813	0.89116717	704	654	630.35452	749.2648	0.9535609	0.9029256	0.0787	-0.00394674989003	1.056079118	2591	1393	2005.8624	1661.7745	1.5013539	1.6708965	-0.1544	-0.129825608368	0.898531919	735	1013	655.17907	1188.3157	1.0277919	1.4247899	-0.4712	-0.262548362967	0.721363820	567	538	521.51732	615.48348	0.7443176	0.5700764	0.3848	-0.0361497885577	1.3056453!sample_table_end
