Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481881/suppl/GSM481881_MR295.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4763	3668	4522.8853	3780.3674	1.7600972	1.4698029	0.2600	0.178314741751	1.19750562	3293	2426	3194.7845	2462.2051	1.4750448	1.1085445	0.4121	0.195508868754	1.33061393	3895	2604	3748.4487	2653.8309	1.2724464	0.9314343	0.4501	0.0647247809259	1.36611514	13233	9548	11981.304	10031.627	3.3867638	3.064016	0.1445	-0.0913701398025	1.10533495	15040	12152	13584.251	12728.867	4.2756272	4.3872306	-0.0372	-0.185045358644	0.97456186	4917	5751	4659.7553	5994.1642	2.2991158	2.7617644	-0.2645	-0.174196873096	0.83248087	2554	2409	2515.7784	2444.4657	0.6890385	0.6788033	0.0216	-0.0130662576281	1.01507838	3558	3412	3437.1302	3502.9266	0.7979987	0.8859026	-0.1508	-0.0335284378819	0.90077479	3606	3738	3481.6912	3854.1859	1.5267168	1.5972746	-0.0652	0.0189914568306	0.955826110	14359	10060	12980.627	10562.902	3.1958999	2.7538546	0.2148	0.0181632631555	1.160518811	20354	17099	18375.039	17826.334	4.5585684	4.7832799	-0.0694	-0.0991236883724	0.953021512	12398	9086	11244.569	9540.0024	2.7979881	2.5060184	0.1590	-0.122887737849	1.116507413	9829	8405	8996.1268	8815.0783	2.0681684	2.0540914	0.0099	-0.0109774304516	1.006853214	2578	5374	2537.6459	5586.1365	2.5184853	3.5850544	-0.5094	-0.371219369782	0.702495715	5487	4512	5162.111	4676.9359	1.2459172	1.2131266	0.0385	0.0234096574069	1.027029816	4457	4500	4249.1655	4663.9878	1.0022762	1.1579255	-0.2083	-0.0864937388615	0.865579117	1191	1152	1256.8879	1127.0437	0.5716559	0.5204358	0.1354	0.106468929934	1.098417918	1759	2575	1782.9105	2622.1238	1.5743973	1.5630191	0.0105	0.00695689867363	1.007279619	2621	2499	2576.7859	2539.1541	1.0943836	1.1092959	-0.0195	-0.0192870656576	0.986556920	4423	3287	4219.0988	3370.8944	0.9467524	0.8078322	0.2289	0.0358731577517	1.1719666!sample_table_end
