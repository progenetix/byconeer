Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481705/suppl/GSM481705_JBH201.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6899	6885	6646.7147	7016.3875	1.2554044	1.2374525	0.0208	-0.139727573257	1.01450712	5269	4796	5030.8874	5035.7211	1.1394142	1.0944386	0.0581	-0.00156556733251	1.04109473	6376	6864	6108.5948	6996.9026	1.0716549	1.0299277	0.0573	-0.14382360931	1.04051474	15185	15874	14815.367	15557.156	1.9250962	2.2815127	-0.2451	-0.194391102587	0.84378055	15834	24979	15431.144	24535.206	3.2000829	4.0622352	-0.3442	-0.267931476075	0.7877646	12561	13175	12242.703	12966.621	2.4147675	2.113828	0.1920	0.122242662043	1.14236717	4847	3389	4618.394	3656.591	0.8908677	0.8375605	0.0890	-0.06083471272	1.06364588	5989	5736	5718.177	5922.223	0.9278393	0.9626859	-0.0532	0.00798338530769	0.96380279	9564	9061	9277.7917	9084.358	1.9918471	1.7973486	0.1482	0.193907208466	1.108214110	25698	24309	24831.191	23869.291	3.6527867	3.6028124	0.0199	0.00954639805638	1.013870911	22851	21849	22141.204	21424.88	4.2663856	3.8257057	0.1573	-0.15030498317	1.115189112	2850	4322	2662.9235	4571.5367	0.7330918	1.1685949	-0.6727	-0.411530898581	0.627327613	6582	6520	6322.2841	6676.4274	1.7314651	1.7104882	0.0176	-0.0679640533564	1.012263714	7481	8710	7204.5856	8750.3584	1.7849886	2.0233874	-0.1809	-0.11036686256	0.882178315	3911	2874	3683.6783	3146.2979	0.976792	0.7665353	0.3497	0.202645274861	1.274294716	5484	5033	5236.9907	5256.495	1.2951779	1.270108	0.0282	0.00829856187253	1.019738317	1989	1735	1851.4353	1971.8052	0.4078286	0.4215564	-0.0478	-0.283890728838	0.967435518	6672	6688	6416.0423	6833.2358	1.5905154	1.6128134	-0.0201	-0.0119384230287	0.986174419	7375	6232	7105.4342	6401.2823	1.35946	1.1922479	0.1893	0.109217319256	1.140249420	6070	6036	5796.2619	6211.0312	0.8119093	0.8345597	-0.0397	-0.0414220998282	0.9728595!sample_table_end
