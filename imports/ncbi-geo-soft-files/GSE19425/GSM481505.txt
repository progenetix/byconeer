Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481505/suppl/GSM481505_DE424.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2912	2549	2963.6103	2468.5886	1.0516296	0.8864664	0.2465	-0.0423902971402	1.18631632	2025	1706	2093.9433	1626.174	0.9277451	0.7022712	0.4017	0.475257373296	1.32106373	4877	4224	4885.4778	4169.2529	1.5272788	1.3437922	0.1847	0.036996842681	1.13654384	11841	10131	11382.738	10295.025	3.9594092	3.6711511	0.1091	0.167360882498	1.07851985	16357	12929	15383.698	13345.502	5.0429947	4.3831249	0.2023	0.231995735996	1.15054786	9595	11267	9351.1648	11528.518	3.0234943	3.9814276	-0.3971	-0.335975090007	0.75939957	2092	3012	2159.1455	2938.9059	0.8104579	1.0665854	-0.3962	-0.254684366404	0.75986218	1619	1736	1699.0373	1656.2078	0.6169547	0.6116082	0.0126	0.159553497238	1.00874169	2419	2369	2475.3958	2288.4937	1.058503	0.9773148	0.1151	-0.0313628051058	1.083072710	7733	7463	7627.6941	7464.0707	3.4738539	3.4885451	-0.0061	-0.267166581517	0.995788711	15812	13563	14909.211	14037.948	6.1938644	5.8564691	0.0808	-0.158579710211	1.057610712	6135	6938	6120.0062	6921.4761	2.5129501	2.7300816	-0.1196	0.150540180565	0.920466913	5229	4976	5232.0785	4918.3229	2.3894348	2.1307867	0.1653	-0.264931758172	1.121386114	12225	11048	11725.331	11290.872	4.7958144	4.5025402	0.0910	0.09091926461	1.065135215	3938	3504	3978.5414	3433.7785	1.5940054	1.3323717	0.2587	-0.0862598620624	1.196366816	3158	3230	3206.53	3159.2448	1.2200516	1.1585682	0.0746	-0.056772278695	1.053068417	1830	2276	1905.6873	2196.5642	0.7720908	0.8322191	-0.1082	-0.217090437178	0.927749318	3958	4460	3998.0916	4405.0746	1.4366445	1.5658975	-0.1243	-0.227168577133	0.917457519	2856	3211	2908.2852	3140.075	1.2872059	1.4026668	-0.1239	-0.257573954805	0.917684720	1440	1308	1523.6675	1233.313	0.6442937	0.5511636	0.2252	-0.0016066427131	1.1689698!sample_table_end
