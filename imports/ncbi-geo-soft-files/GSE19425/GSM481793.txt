Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481793/suppl/GSM481793_MR031.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2016	2187	2122.1123	2066.5799	1.0349025	0.9815926	0.0763	0.0449278702377	1.05430962	1669	1689	1761.7979	1606.8001	0.9246059	0.7610696	0.2808	0.170143761544	1.2148773	3523	3107	3620.569	2943.0793	1.6848033	1.3910707	0.2764	0.0901976340994	1.21115584	11629	12611	10822.183	12197.253	5.3856645	6.1550635	-0.1926	-0.194837496003	0.87499745	15989	15973	14375.262	15503.733	7.1914705	7.9324081	-0.1415	-0.101896028463	0.90659366	8537	6206	8197.6936	5959.5199	4.0247836	2.9811495	0.4330	0.330388478982	1.35007787	2966	2521	3078.0662	2385.1098	1.4690025	1.1557757	0.3460	0.359928620822	1.271018	1857	2336	1957.4095	2206.9401	0.9914426	1.1321678	-0.1915	-0.0247920976614	0.87570299	2449	3105	2563.1466	2941.1083	1.2464917	1.2751568	-0.0328	0.0285882465636	0.977520410	6879	6135	6743.1423	5889.4547	3.2144469	3.1939803	0.0092	0.0217908327259	1.006407911	3548	4085	3645.223	3897.0043	1.9248399	2.1720479	-0.1743	-0.104712860574	0.886186712	5376	5515	5378.9737	5280.0434	2.8522441	2.7297473	0.0633	0.18939609784	1.044874813	1585	1925	1670.2517	1821.7035	0.9768019	1.0019166	-0.0366	0.0295574840115	0.974933314	6329	5666	6252.7523	5428.8496	2.817559	2.649223	0.0889	0.0831531738409	1.063541615	1587	1773	1672.4426	1683.2714	0.8796159	0.8518878	0.0462	0.0380439175685	1.03254916	1758	2203	1855.5335	2081.7527	0.9529375	1.0377032	-0.1229	-0.0581876776377	0.918314117	1222	1096	1286.2242	1080.2381	0.6656536	0.5207864	0.3541	0.174685342436	1.278170118	5915	5276	5880.9573	5046.5527	2.6266699	2.4355449	0.1090	0.144937040413	1.078473219	1395	1648	1473.1706	1569.1012	0.7756596	0.7740428	0.0030	0.0141831591912	1.002088820	1710	1923	1805.556	1819.8655	0.9836123	0.9185378	0.0988	0.0861490852624	1.0708458!sample_table_end
