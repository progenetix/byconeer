Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481957/suppl/GSM481957_MR383.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5240	4613	4945.0324	4714.4537	1.7956142	1.656499	0.1163	-0.214656742546	1.08398142	3486	3433	3414.2613	3456.6298	1.2964685	1.321577	-0.0277	-0.210322874357	0.98100113	2546	2300	2555.4266	2295.0746	0.8223346	0.7147911	0.2022	-0.0274451749825	1.15045444	9385	8926	8433.8974	9335.7494	2.5285176	2.6939415	-0.0914	-0.152946010364	0.9385945	18537	14057	15884.37	14831.129	5.4070265	4.8201394	0.1658	0.0562105989905	1.12175726	6936	5501	6390.7116	5646.785	2.194318	1.8818597	0.2216	0.0323502773322	1.16603697	2105	2375	2143.7296	2371.2274	0.7740283	0.8257859	-0.0934	-0.0518163236098	0.93732328	2398	3963	2418.2978	4018.4583	0.6937385	1.1753656	-0.7606	-0.558414388023	0.5902329	3469	4332	3398.9854	4407.7766	1.2260029	1.5719722	-0.3586	-0.243312932066	0.779913810	10772	8158	9578.3913	8519.8395	3.0268498	2.985137	0.0200	-0.0562425294114	1.013973511	14811	11577	12841.382	12204.374	4.0823735	4.3045361	-0.0764	-0.10863565994	0.948388712	6626	5741	6122.9952	5900.4905	1.960695	1.8461704	0.0868	0.0772886721568	1.062033613	4974	4680	4721.761	4788.1613	1.5290527	1.6082269	-0.0728	-0.174517724445	0.950769214	9143	8981	8235.2271	9394.983	3.3453581	3.7394878	-0.1607	-0.111298266253	0.894603315	3249	3712	3202.1295	3749.6215	0.9588652	1.1288632	-0.2355	-0.204722720851	0.849407816	2309	3150	2334.2612	3169.0791	0.7433708	0.9716955	-0.3864	-0.121311990576	0.765024417	1545	1076	1597.3625	1125.9919	0.6286561	0.4533386	0.4717	0.209564534646	1.386725218	5159	5400	4877.1822	5541.6289	1.5714033	1.7054782	-0.1181	-0.225098739335	0.921385719	2562	2286	2569.766	2280.8569	0.9910394	0.9382088	0.0790	-0.128058472288	1.0563120	2921	2817	2903.7249	2819.5259	0.8448693	0.9111211	-0.1089	-0.102432017204	0.9272854!sample_table_end
