Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481600/suppl/GSM481600_EL664.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3119	2700	3164.9021	2641.7847	1.1329958	0.9272947	-0.2890	-0.0118700981863	0.81844492	1791	1779	1837.5337	1743.4665	0.9644868	0.8646037	-0.1577	0.0609314121715	0.89643913	2552	2388	2598.4166	2335.1507	0.8384454	0.7784745	-0.1071	0.0762322114019	0.92847364	11559	11464	11544.218	11167.346	3.5180793	3.5980034	0.0324	-0.0557443294158	1.02271815	16876	27625	16679.779	27326.375	5.5693839	9.1215749	0.7118	0.0543168561783	1.63780686	11242	10529	11236.775	10246.667	4.1604787	3.869787	-0.1045	-0.111219460169	0.93013027	2866	3371	2915.6389	3289.9011	0.9990424	1.0897192	0.1253	-0.205622764081	1.09076388	2709	3031	2755.8905	2960.5383	0.7820067	0.8755325	0.1630	-0.0489542650209	1.11959719	2313	2335	2358.2331	2285.2441	1.2283515	1.1370086	-0.1115	-0.0794990123923	0.925637810	12800	14837	12755.772	14529.699	4.3911819	5.0494971	0.2015	0.0348033811507	1.149917511	16290	13378	16121.316	13075.301	5.0546231	4.2081125	-0.2644	-0.061095327772	0.832527412	7541	7420	7591.4814	7218.5951	2.364399	2.2790989	-0.0530	-0.0107458723411	0.963923113	1848	2242	1895.979	2197.5176	0.6698731	0.7559283	0.1744	0.102652085132	1.12846514	6073	6332	6135.9957	6178.5089	3.5153822	3.2596407	-0.1090	0.0124332290086	0.927250715	2698	2857	2744.6607	2792.1108	0.7990981	0.8349497	0.0633	0.0875092783104	1.04486516	1957	2823	2005.4923	2759.5896	0.6442423	0.892589	0.4704	0.137855498401	1.385486417	430	451	460.5766	441.2516	0.2298904	0.2075771	-0.1473	-0.0103118555214	0.902939418	4710	4322	4757.7369	4224.6591	2.0614691	1.7788352	-0.2127	-0.0980232649649	0.862896819	1141	1238	1190.6707	1211.2436	0.6096091	0.5995859	-0.0239	0.0351185260806	0.983557820	2136	1815	2179.936	1778.1747	0.7811923	0.6342404	-0.3006	0.0151455591047	0.8118876!sample_table_end
