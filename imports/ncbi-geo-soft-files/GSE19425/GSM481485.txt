Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481485/suppl/GSM481485_DE394.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3558	3355	3610.8761	3184.8613	1.8503791	1.7376623	0.0907	-0.0538531472313	1.06486692	1227	1101	1310.4312	1024.9008	1.2287026	0.7978057	0.6230	0.540246732718	1.54010253	3086	2328	3151.2557	2202.1477	1.3869358	1.1779297	0.2356	0.000199366678731	1.17743514	4579	3013	4595.2146	2853.6636	2.9468872	2.0103676	0.5517	0.358046236536	1.4658455	11674	7765	11393.848	7414.6066	5.1518175	4.1194897	0.3226	0.356182807549	1.2505966	7294	6707	7226.1234	6390.1326	3.2542063	3.4948641	-0.1029	-0.05008647878	0.93113967	2607	2639	2683.9933	2501.6316	1.2156578	1.1799675	0.0430	-0.065431686872	1.03024688	865	877	935.3631	820.9159	0.7381871	0.7448669	-0.0130	-0.131249365628	0.99103229	1195	1890	1276.8965	1773.9394	1.4246036	1.5180547	-0.0917	0.075155530201	0.938440210	3962	5495	3998.6712	5242.0724	6.0863734	7.5394004	-0.3089	-0.236028522047	0.807275511	4222	7130	4251.2245	6795.9647	5.9841263	8.6642603	-0.5339	-0.293806671943	0.690667912	2779	2611	2850.855	2474.9969	1.6707862	1.4744496	0.1804	0.235274025354	1.133159213	1648	2828	1736.5419	2677.4141	1.9734964	2.6009522	-0.3983	-0.443419497594	0.758759214	2973	4294	3040.6886	4081.8877	2.3318323	2.3061679	0.0160	0.0412084917341	1.011128615	1608	1821	1697.3676	1707.4294	1.1567349	1.1929435	-0.0445	-0.208673956877	0.969647716	3127	3313	3191.2917	3143.8624	1.6384276	1.6221673	0.0144	-0.0532802922536	1.010023817	984	1157	1055.3814	1076.3001	0.632251	0.6703059	-0.0843	-0.203441399416	0.943227518	4274	5165	4301.952	4923.8373	1.6979613	2.1053225	-0.3102	-0.25497752386	0.806508919	1255	2171	1339.412	2047.7784	1.6241804	1.7924378	-0.1422	-0.138455523107	0.906129320	589	669	643.7282	632.6581	0.7605057	0.7693519	-0.0167	-0.213274746383	0.9885018!sample_table_end
