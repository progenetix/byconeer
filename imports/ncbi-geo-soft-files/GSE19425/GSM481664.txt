Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481664/suppl/GSM481664_JA914.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1642	1345	1669.1849	1307.4771	0.9956247	0.7787579	-0.3544	-0.141581463019	0.78218022	1267	1132	1325.2164	1102.3809	1.0686874	0.8642513	-0.3063	-0.136918590553	0.80870353	2346	2016	2284.7789	1979.4735	1.1774842	1.0365226	-0.1840	-0.0257908324688	0.88028584	6049	3573	5495.6412	3524.1772	2.7983803	1.80321	-0.6340	-0.503744259755	0.64437635	7700	4374	7008.563	4318.9871	4.0203642	2.4916034	-0.6903	-0.533591596316	0.61974576	5954	6946	5410.1812	6819.7856	2.9371482	3.7083525	0.3364	0.430789351951	1.2625697	1945	3355	1944.143	3310.4213	0.990858	1.6397293	0.7267	0.727926464873	1.6548588	1744	2517	1763.8514	2478.6782	0.8624943	1.2402583	0.5241	0.41290495515	1.43799019	1137	2178	1205.6272	2140.064	0.968636	1.661359	0.7783	0.573031651722	1.71515310	4721	5097	4315.7508	5028.724	2.1375352	2.4984535	0.2251	0.0327446564769	1.168847911	14325	10375	13411.184	10037.254	6.5551878	5.1056733	-0.3605	-0.117943553289	0.778875212	3887	2273	3593.4318	2232.1905	1.7444082	1.0749101	-0.6985	-0.63640895646	0.616203313	3095	3375	2930.4663	3330.0308	1.4059548	1.4654726	0.0598	-0.105534384546	1.042332614	4289	3294	3942.1815	3250.6022	3.0789132	2.3712367	-0.3768	-0.269152058858	0.770153815	3490	3704	3256.4758	3654.2031	1.4800844	1.6971612	0.1974	0.211635004157	1.146665116	1888	2233	1895.2414	2193.6219	0.8877671	1.0101904	0.1864	0.0424461283096	1.137900217	855	823	934.0416	813.358	0.6967661	0.5912844	-0.2368	-0.100782984491	0.848612418	2171	3018	2135.7162	2981.2366	1.3451292	1.8249065	0.4401	0.347667697047	1.356677519	1185	1369	1249.8726	1331.2268	1.001634	1.0678436	0.0923	0.0525762928892	1.066101620	901	699	980.3989	698.0267	0.6132467	0.4371106	-0.4885	-0.218792240168	0.712781!sample_table_end
