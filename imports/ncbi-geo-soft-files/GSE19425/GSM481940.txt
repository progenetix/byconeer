Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481940/suppl/GSM481940_MR366.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4040	3749	3978.4693	3769.9051	1.7137207	1.6597204	-0.0462	0.0478957029348	0.96848942	2956	3116	2910.3675	3149.6633	1.2508887	1.4340718	0.1972	0.0273304487685	1.14644243	3888	3555	3828.9621	3580.788	1.6007063	1.4769468	-0.1161	-0.0216316966469	0.92268454	9761	10905	9451.1667	10962.625	3.9091846	4.5676101	0.2246	-0.130148361445	1.16843045	10284	10289	9943.7882	10321.273	4.7107134	4.6855478	-0.0077	-0.187541846206	0.99465786	4275	5053	4213.6342	5036.1966	1.9327171	2.2700558	0.2321	0.159827688035	1.17454127	1639	2235	1615.097	2272.9735	0.8611176	1.110759	0.3673	0.229253818638	1.2899048	1274	1525	1262.2995	1555.5732	0.4881612	0.6121156	0.3264	-0.0534111035453	1.2539219	3342	3243	3295.5629	3274.7069	1.3204923	1.3888119	0.0728	-0.09839983357	1.05173810	11615	9728	11189.723	9734.7142	4.7817844	4.1649546	-0.1992	-0.0974631188119	0.871004311	11906	10993	11460.871	11054.497	4.8155895	4.7358764	-0.0241	-0.000266187363302	0.983446912	7259	9199	7098.7695	9190.2933	3.3054036	4.0875368	0.3064	-0.114880435414	1.236622613	4101	3894	4039.5567	3911.1003	1.8044772	1.6843825	-0.0994	-0.115275025857	0.933446314	5591	6779	5497.3815	6739.9277	2.6353581	3.3458247	0.3444	-0.173319145728	1.269590215	4322	3981	4260.3971	3996.0103	1.7705121	1.6359576	-0.1140	0.0129749307075	0.924002516	2708	3197	2664.4616	3229.4301	1.2859408	1.4617426	0.1849	-0.0702331004124	1.136710617	861	788	861.5723	801.1846	0.3732234	0.3618537	-0.0446	0.138287087794	0.969536418	3590	4284	3537.4509	4290.7213	1.6698476	1.9799101	0.2457	0.0356184204416	1.185683119	1920	1663	1890.1648	1698.7789	0.8162903	0.7830086	-0.0601	-0.0342668019584	0.959228220	1775	1731	1748.9146	1767.8022	0.7104784	0.7608494	0.0988	-0.145488443149	1.0708973!sample_table_end
