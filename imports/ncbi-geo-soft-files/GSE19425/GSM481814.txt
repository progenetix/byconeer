Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481814/suppl/GSM481814_MR066.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6119	6329	6140.4036	6257.2203	1.3883553	1.4325579	0.0452	0.0875926440187	1.03183812	4848	5150	4925.6173	5051.7965	1.1278258	1.1505113	0.0287	-0.0366264094777	1.02011433	4761	4228	4840.4739	4123.1601	1.0856317	0.9599505	-0.1775	0.00727603168574	0.88423224	11865	8847	11586.781	8817.0709	2.7426948	2.1156711	-0.3745	-0.155932972313	0.77138415	17463	13455	17053.391	13438.415	3.9982675	3.1280482	-0.3541	-0.19047195572	0.78235096	10761	11188	10527.844	11181.594	2.4669045	2.6582072	0.1078	0.0965224323421	1.07754767	3188	3722	3299.4844	3615.7314	0.7300408	0.8078875	0.1462	0.150466873207	1.10663338	2398	2891	2511.7916	2800.2521	0.6218233	0.6557003	0.0765	-0.0167798964038	1.05448019	8731	8389	8598.1499	8342.1686	1.9101625	1.8190793	-0.0705	-0.0304558027356	0.952316510	14973	13897	14628.121	13875.301	3.7660168	3.6298334	-0.0531	-0.0223756441787	0.963838911	22575	19681	22006.456	19684.927	5.5966927	5.1295517	-0.1257	-0.0681433761798	0.916532712	7903	7448	7820.6827	7389.2013	1.7359136	1.7632294	0.0225	0.0705290564443	1.015735713	9170	8744	9013.663	8709.0401	2.173344	2.206008	0.0215	-0.0190366276777	1.015029414	12487	11872	12188.078	11864.213	2.8027562	2.5784422	-0.1203	-0.0919650279314	0.919966615	6407	6767	6405.7281	6700.0914	1.4394663	1.5477005	0.1046	0.0573652849782	1.075190516	5032	5345	5102.9438	5249.1411	1.0954544	1.1564367	0.0782	0.0347208519355	1.055668517	2659	2530	2775.3579	2448.2896	0.6250796	0.5521144	-0.1791	-0.0989650098994	0.883270518	7185	8304	7145.5882	8255.0581	1.5276868	1.7357934	0.1842	0.233120135972	1.136223419	5228	5632	5290.3106	5545.2872	1.2948554	1.3221677	0.0301	-0.0659599438461	1.02109320	2338	2726	2450.3954	2640.8225	0.6183928	0.6526898	0.0779	0.10101423589	1.0554615!sample_table_end
