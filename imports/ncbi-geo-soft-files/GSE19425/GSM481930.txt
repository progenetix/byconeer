Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481930/suppl/GSM481930_MR354.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3870	3067	3556.095	3310.7402	2.2033351	2.0599712	-0.0971	0.11641013965	0.93493322	1703	1650	1553.1969	1804.3855	0.9415531	1.1132788	0.2417	0.00550605696312	1.18238553	3425	3200	3147.1742	3451.7742	1.7165623	1.8887497	0.1379	-0.129740148675	1.10030954	3543	2448	3257.069	2653.4968	1.9460026	1.6015032	-0.2811	0.0537167936752	0.82297075	8038	6698	7405.8718	7194.8768	3.9926999	3.8965643	-0.0352	-0.0553235625892	0.97592226	3859	3286	3545.9625	3543.2041	1.9618876	1.972735	0.0080	-0.0927860614971	1.00552917	3085	2890	2828.4294	3124.0112	1.30328	1.4667845	0.1705	-0.120772927205	1.12545628	1601	1302	1459.2493	1431.4917	0.9249508	0.8995853	-0.0401	-0.0678038507369	0.97257649	4168	4401	3832.2865	4727.1136	2.1433457	2.7005704	0.3334	0.038427331601	1.259978910	4320	4683	3973.881	5027.2855	2.4863947	3.0479415	0.2938	-0.0559775852187	1.225847811	15128	10006	13728.068	10813.404	8.9291285	6.9159658	-0.3686	0.0391218256352	0.774539812	4040	3595	3713.1575	3871.4744	2.0783976	2.1711423	0.0630	-0.00340826364717	1.044623213	3542	3432	3256.1559	3698.6248	1.7046173	1.8729853	0.1359	-0.0256450108499	1.098771714	5414	5030	4993.0936	5399.599	2.9207621	3.1706188	0.1184	0.0131028901888	1.08554515	2489	2352	2278.9696	2551.3101	1.3487189	1.4942026	0.1478	0.0390159526942	1.107868116	2937	3134	2690.1833	3381.6165	1.3487694	1.7042342	0.3375	-0.0286809749178	1.263547517	974	928	885.1428	1027.1087	0.5376501	0.6303522	0.2295	-0.0133232911005	1.172420918	3894	3704	3578.2038	3987.1294	1.7950481	2.0084666	0.1621	0.0471518035849	1.11889319	3013	2681	2760.9532	2902.3074	1.7728541	1.8947945	0.0960	-0.050243187277	1.06878220	1480	1422	1346.9575	1562.092	0.8193869	0.9343708	0.1895	-0.0570279734367	1.1403292!sample_table_end
