Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481539/suppl/GSM481539_EL159.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1485	1227	1432.1752	1265.6656	1.0018677	0.898853	0.1565	-0.06449969889	1.11460692	2061	1860	1990.3229	1905.6518	1.5361327	1.5079708	0.0267	-0.0183448231735	1.01867533	894	736	859.283	773.8383	0.5251103	0.4752086	0.1441	-0.0347236925047	1.10501014	7485	8566	7237.7309	8569.1387	4.647956	5.6302812	-0.2766	-0.241707740141	0.82552825	13518	16613	13026.511	16539.751	8.8687925	11.362295	-0.3574	0.0935192068274	0.78054586	7862	6918	7601.2977	6936.1786	5.081941	4.7304655	0.1034	0.0328027604575	1.07430047	1266	1916	1221.8331	1960.9062	1.0163685	1.4426422	-0.5053	-0.0358710854833	0.70451888	1729	1504	1669.0599	1547.1726	1.20296	1.1196852	0.1035	-0.00638657143972	1.07437349	3058	2893	2959.0522	2941.5837	2.2147217	2.2226749	-0.0052	-0.0716636084303	0.996421710	2710	2992	2617.0024	3041.0772	2.5213422	2.9213944	-0.2125	-0.0445701190514	0.863061211	5949	5703	5755.4567	5729.4492	5.1138623	5.177082	-0.0177	-0.195606712307	0.987788512	1720	1480	1660.1557	1522.9818	1.3410041	1.2537103	0.0971	-0.0223257094898	1.069628313	1053	927	1014.3548	963.8318	1.006989	0.9129224	0.1415	0.00315835079359	1.103038914	5228	4099	5059.8872	4140.1386	3.5258615	3.0039688	0.2311	0.0708886887426	1.173734415	678	707	647.925	745.3831	0.6073884	0.7003799	-0.2055	-0.23666211322	0.867226916	892	885	857.3226	921.2986	0.6625629	0.7044969	-0.0885	-0.01016096481	0.940476717	513	443	483.9966	480.9772	0.389984	0.3955679	-0.0205	-0.125794064156	0.985883718	2059	1729	1988.42	1775.1113	1.2628947	1.150724	0.1342	0.0302617697164	1.097478319	618	522	589.3711	559.9719	0.5255058	0.4942181	0.0886	-0.00628599320838	1.063307420	1079	886	1039.5788	922.2845	0.9388349	0.8094198	0.2140	-0.0506267624723	1.1598862!sample_table_end
