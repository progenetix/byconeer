Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481688/suppl/GSM481688_JA952.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1986	1498	1980.956	1498.0517	1.0937057	0.8681761	-0.3332	-0.0450748194577	0.79379312	1910	2179	1904.9859	2164.9848	1.0915089	1.2049274	0.1426	0.0330918352844	1.10390983	1816	1436	1811.2127	1436.0354	1.1681316	0.9692785	-0.2692	-0.0369129105347	0.82976824	3626	3198	3598.6788	3179.7718	3.0481092	2.7587188	-0.1439	-0.113003757236	0.9050595	8310	8037	8137.5453	8049.9071	5.5047497	5.592957	0.0229	-0.0724205265941	1.01602386	5382	4857	5306.4598	4842.4732	3.0562755	2.9966395	-0.0284	0.0659389700909	0.98048737	648	769	639.4006	779.6309	0.9077236	1.1151607	0.2969	0.192996169158	1.22852458	1065	1087	1057.1982	1093.752	1.0640351	1.1004538	0.0486	0.0408227308407	1.03422699	1928	2264	1922.933	2248.1846	1.0656983	1.2124796	0.1862	0.0771882985574	1.137732410	1946	2151	1940.8973	2137.8681	1.8792277	2.0193807	0.1038	0.0688650369609	1.074580111	4015	3177	3976.5878	3158.7297	3.6083255	2.8879902	-0.3213	-0.0563472665817	0.800368512	922	853	912.6913	863.1193	1.5368884	1.3891045	-0.1459	-0.0669617110514	0.903842113	616	815	607.3631	825.6101	1.0810034	1.4123065	0.3857	0.119317261933	1.306477314	6498	7977	6388.2864	7987.6507	3.2068814	3.9550754	0.3025	0.0691395502132	1.233308915	676	718	667.263	728.8037	0.9431183	1.0169214	0.1087	0.104575657679	1.078254316	544	550	535.0548	562.7091	0.8492126	0.9170442	0.1109	-0.0863625738655	1.079875817	862	818	853.1731	828.5842	0.5059391	0.4822731	-0.0691	0.00968383348705	0.953223718	2625	2478	2616.703	2461.3916	1.1596268	1.1293235	-0.0382	0.00986983056072	0.973868119	1299	1252	1292.6932	1256.2342	0.8232069	0.7711189	-0.0943	0.0302634650135	0.936725520	549	616	540.0577	628.0225	0.4339498	0.5015675	0.2089	0.279580050842	1.1558189!sample_table_end
