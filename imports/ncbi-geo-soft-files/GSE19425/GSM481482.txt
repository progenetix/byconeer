Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481482/suppl/GSM481482_DE389.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3269	2290	3059.2897	2360.1837	1.3376507	1.1361152	-0.2356	-0.152157373884	0.84933622	992	1090	983.5628	1123.5854	1.2507853	1.2781745	0.0313	0.0520577496973	1.02189763	2788	1706	2612.8453	1770.9787	1.4309885	1.0147638	-0.4959	-0.162633192592	0.70913484	2846	2998	2666.967	3033.5808	1.4371299	1.6654598	0.2127	0.0192206749344	1.15887915	7506	6634	6723.6468	6765.5134	3.5306789	3.9212597	0.1514	-0.0383390991638	1.11062486	4813	4525	4447.9812	4542.9609	2.5096862	2.6688443	0.0887	-0.0453270497936	1.06341757	430	464	485.0233	428.9316	1.062028	0.8851989	-0.2627	-0.287520396946	0.83349878	2300	1648	2160.7151	1711.9834	0.9319761	0.7700438	-0.2754	-0.189620882076	0.82624849	640	940	708.8929	949.0691	0.9654846	1.1209925	0.2155	-0.0354599628865	1.161067210	2294	2248	2155.1822	2320.4269	2.6551733	2.4973563	-0.0884	-0.0833099365602	0.940562411	4954	4440	4571.3971	4457.115	5.1357903	4.4566851	-0.2046	-0.319436117146	0.867770112	624	745	693.3387	714.7588	1.2627545	1.1391031	-0.1487	-0.244764942104	0.90207813	616	873	685.3784	866.1579	1.464806	1.4902982	0.0249	-0.100963927039	1.017403114	2403	2343	2255.6497	2410.2669	2.3220054	2.6915117	0.2130	-0.0452206831234	1.159132415	1204	990	1152.716	1008.9044	1.6290795	1.2776556	-0.3506	-0.139883280545	0.784280716	423	502	476.9605	463.1796	0.9539777	0.8173977	-0.2229	-0.137803219949	0.85683117	745	590	801.6684	542.754	0.8491068	0.6224367	-0.4480	-0.196965429441	0.733048818	2207	1607	2075.2629	1670.6851	1.5332159	1.3169231	-0.2194	-0.31771911848	0.858928719	1449	1242	1363.8192	1292.3863	1.8130605	1.5708112	-0.2069	-0.191606974897	0.866386520	489	554	550.9603	509.5746	0.7405684	0.5460637	-0.4396	-0.206134423727	0.7373576!sample_table_end
