Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9775!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481634/suppl/GSM481634_JA689.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1006	2236	1291.8675	1944.0299	0.5843317	0.7699043	0.3979	-0.024425893939	1.31758092	2751	2755	2958.09	2435.6359	0.6492684	0.6472408	-0.0045	-0.308316481443	0.9968773	5155	4560	5054.447	4219.0263	1.2667277	1.3613366	0.1039	0.00228428520023	1.07468764	4696	5119	4664.0768	4746.6968	2.8399324	2.0847768	-0.4460	-0.4502947759	0.73409385	32289	14319	25729.601	14652.206	5.8278138	4.1059857	-0.5052	-0.393680223734	0.70454996	5462	9215	5310.1199	9026.3253	1.7899731	2.5689644	0.5212	0.278931439496	1.43519727	2389	4833	2640.8376	4475.8699	0.9247972	1.2616178	0.4481	0.766711505464	1.36421028	1393	2666	1691.3735	2349.3607	0.7602026	0.853257	0.1666	-0.0548471695178	1.12240759	5862	5272	5642.8659	4905.8808	1.556949	1.5498434	-0.0066	0.296431445969	0.995436210	3618	4102	3736.7595	3746.4581	3.3700925	3.3056536	-0.0279	-0.116534096035	0.980879211	5674	6375	5486.9532	6100.3688	3.0973196	2.8669457	-0.1115	-0.153697090223	0.925621512	6708	6122	6351.77	5834.1953	2.2106095	2.0925845	-0.0792	-0.351941827208	0.946609813	1789	3267	2078.1307	2929.2467	1.3235913	1.4632571	0.1447	0.038703483928	1.105520314	12350	7036	10842.793	6776.1871	4.1778438	2.3677595	-0.8192	-0.314579988105	0.56674215	724	1257	969.3077	1052.4802	0.5570427	0.6671631	0.2603	-0.0240336862264	1.197687516	4787	5077	4743.3843	4703.0969	1.9009197	1.5378795	-0.3058	-0.164253618524	0.809018717	625	977	852.4569	810.3242	0.3814579	0.3421737	-0.1568	-0.143261220375	0.897015418	4743	4884	4705.0574	4522.937	1.094591	1.3699283	0.3237	-0.0701662143228	1.251543519	1890	2045	2169.8868	1767.5257	0.7035377	0.7420376	0.0769	-0.109577978297	1.054723320	4424	3309	4428.1859	2972.5479	1.1224857	0.9640047	-0.2196	-0.12445676277	0.8588125!sample_table_end
