Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481911/suppl/GSM481911_MR325.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5710	5656	5758.2237	5536.035	1.2249393	1.2680348	-0.0499	0.0233565680918	0.96601392	5907	5506	5949.5709	5383.7825	1.5941567	1.5279207	0.0612	0.0200747255543	1.04335033	3817	3124	3930.4353	3001.2967	0.825611	0.6558195	0.3322	0.00576688508902	1.25889974	19594	17124	18722.379	17127.24	3.7568595	3.5079725	0.0989	-0.114167090363	1.07094895	24646	24853	23421.685	24825.864	5.5267763	5.8842186	-0.0904	-0.211664453713	0.9392546	14647	9413	14150.64	9324.1645	3.3463613	2.3440571	0.5136	0.214851442143	1.42759377	3188	2695	3313.2607	2591.7988	1.0749479	0.7802784	0.4622	0.207241055939	1.37764658	4652	5293	4733.1403	5165.7996	1.0027378	1.1182591	-0.1573	-0.0368025744745	0.89669549	2874	3490	2997.3436	3359.2163	0.791361	0.9245384	-0.2244	-0.0606172209005	0.855952510	14011	15396	13562	15376.174	3.2769285	3.807971	-0.2167	-0.197560865365	0.860544411	15706	18552	15121.412	18552.991	3.4547122	4.2676889	-0.3049	-0.216858765617	0.809504212	11298	12911	11054.202	12849.945	3.1564621	3.4161829	-0.1141	-0.259422544503	0.923973313	3907	4602	4017.4161	4467.1833	1.325679	1.3838743	-0.0620	-0.046894816807	0.957947514	11525	13289	11269.013	13236.773	4.1606826	5.0154829	-0.2696	-0.251284205306	0.829567715	3041	3874	3164.2955	3746.7725	0.7577861	0.8638886	-0.1891	-0.0903566924173	0.877180316	2147	3251	2268.9733	3124.5743	0.6566135	0.8348804	-0.3465	-0.155625017597	0.786476217	988	861	1055.393	869.2793	0.2683223	0.2389166	0.1675	0.122485338501	1.123079418	5448	4826	5502.7212	4694.6051	1.7458285	1.5038023	0.2153	0.109373398163	1.160942819	2300	2661	2422.3752	2559.5302	0.6029043	0.6804442	-0.1745	-0.0967979971489	0.886045220	2902	3310	3025.341	3181.9377	0.6362792	0.722386	-0.1831	-0.170147599408	0.8808022!sample_table_end
