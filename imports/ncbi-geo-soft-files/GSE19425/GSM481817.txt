Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481817/suppl/GSM481817_MR069.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6220	4534	5650.9439	4967.6451	1.1558908	1.002035	0.2061	0.182730684133	1.15354332	4950	4726	4519.2161	5182.2012	1.0032245	1.0723561	-0.0961	-0.0962686467109	0.9355333	4433	3771	4062.35	4144.0335	0.8333326	0.8551455	-0.0373	-0.222297271523	0.97449224	15807	12159	14397.832	12923.413	2.9071548	2.8019468	0.0532	-0.0688177944228	1.03754815	17426	16432	15886.431	17322.521	3.2876876	3.6637124	-0.1562	-0.309953819758	0.8973656	13217	8888	12018.406	9523.8034	2.6232577	2.11335	0.3118	0.196986425522	1.24127937	4015	3731	3692.7953	4099.5094	0.6961914	0.7740845	-0.1530	-0.130689692223	0.89937398	4075	3346	3746.1651	3673.3084	0.7309833	0.7711128	-0.0771	0.0152757529678	0.94795899	6960	6005	6322.9534	6533.0417	1.3918385	1.2840399	0.1163	0.132962387178	1.083952610	15185	13945	13827.244	14768.223	2.7297018	3.1048691	-0.1858	-0.130554747165	0.879168111	19284	15799	17592.878	16671.652	3.4819723	3.4955854	-0.0056	0.0222051566401	0.996105612	12288	10278	11175.283	10951.684	2.1235654	2.1626622	-0.0263	0.0171860527609	0.981921913	8075	8479	7342.6558	9110.9592	1.3821222	1.6895486	-0.2898	-0.0810763281844	0.818042214	13724	14033	12484.8	14858.013	2.6487332	2.8010448	-0.0807	-0.0905601114618	0.945623215	7713	5795	7007.9213	6310.983	1.2325764	1.1831737	0.0590	0.101057010584	1.041754416	5557	5503	5062.117	6005.6596	0.9448185	1.1516903	-0.2856	-0.0287162658283	0.820375517	2164	2141	2049.2319	2353.5542	0.4476371	0.4869475	-0.1214	-0.0788840074293	0.919271718	10353	8398	9422.8263	9029.2525	1.7490961	1.6964021	0.0441	0.237867398745	1.031062119	4072	4535	3743.4973	4968.7633	0.8756014	1.0477957	-0.2590	-0.149023720583	0.835660420	3890	3369	3581.5257	3698.4061	0.7120229	0.7557493	-0.0860	-0.0992279537562	0.9421417!sample_table_end
