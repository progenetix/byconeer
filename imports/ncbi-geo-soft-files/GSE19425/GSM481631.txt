Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9775!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481631/suppl/GSM481631_JA688.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	578	999	719.12134	999.01353	0.5161168	0.6373417	-0.3044	-0.0354669122969	0.80979612	1316	1343	1354.1521	1342.8563	0.7721289	0.8464622	-0.1326	0.0301836426119	0.91218363	3665	2784	3516.3281	2728.5841	1.570657	1.4712732	0.0943	0.182310028022	1.06754954	2586	4885	2501.8487	4680.9429	2.7004396	3.7613717	-0.4781	-0.456244306386	0.71794015	8222	10425	7806.5022	9791.8929	4.2905168	6.008637	-0.4859	-0.515358315588	0.71405826	6107	4468	5812.4974	4296.9086	2.5120602	2.2346169	0.1688	0.295309490642	1.12415697	2819	1520	2719.6524	1516.854	1.0976853	0.7298353	0.5888	0.552325127236	1.50401788	3157	2556	3038.6333	2508.9091	1.0356879	1.0408717	-0.0072	0.0418333989646	0.99501979	2179	1554	2126.7183	1547.1652	1.0927296	0.925839	0.2391	0.0860361423186	1.180258710	5148	8362	4910.9784	7891.513	4.0790202	3.9025664	0.0638	0.134953734721	1.045214811	1602	3364	1599.7041	3264.386	1.986451	2.4457166	-0.3001	-0.120605418961	0.812216312	4575	6250	4380.8344	5945.504	2.1308104	2.976085	-0.4820	-0.263173436398	0.715977613	659	1503	794.73865	1500.8773	1.0549335	1.2369331	-0.2296	-0.040092643226	0.852862214	6206	5738	5906.7962	5468.7576	3.48772	3.2037414	0.1225	-0.393092981503	1.088639615	980	1381	1067.038	1381.0375	0.4320554	0.5173467	-0.2599	-0.0333344530986	0.83513716	2587	2725	2502.7889	2672.051	1.9833454	1.9509089	0.0238	-0.0307861346133	1.016626317	705	647	835.33775	628.88491	0.2729352	0.2627545	0.0548	-0.082279451889	1.03874618	2399	2270	2328.5459	2241.6676	1.0601732	1.2181283	-0.2004	0.00824405287137	0.870329619	1993	1420	1955.9539	1420.0747	0.6307797	0.5895205	0.0976	0.113212540392	1.069987720	2583	1947	2499.0241	1927.0286	1.1042435	1.0105491	0.1279	0.0685203085721	1.0927162!sample_table_end
