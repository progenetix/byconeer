Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481950/suppl/GSM481950_MR376.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	8351	5779	8005.1599	6045.1017	1.7536892	1.302642	-0.4290	0.252915889057	0.74280092	6586	7302	6260.6703	7514.6316	1.343858	1.6389331	0.2864	0.0966037946871	1.21957313	4038	3243	3720.4097	3548.7975	0.9338005	0.8724545	-0.0980	0.0970920073018	0.93430494	14610	16135	14159.104	16160.137	3.6803877	4.1571495	0.1757	-0.0553022306528	1.12954115	19495	18750	18885.206	18758.498	4.5700486	4.4880032	-0.0261	-0.0915189156985	0.98204716	9487	8879	9136.5491	9050.2964	2.5246825	2.4417001	-0.0482	0.0110498802625	0.96713157	2776	2781	2494.1575	3078.1865	0.6140471	0.7211123	0.2319	0.00803560866928	1.17435988	4163	3325	3840.9727	3629.876	0.9178464	0.8643887	-0.0866	-0.0999199865582	0.94175759	6530	4933	6202.898	5211.9688	1.2892075	1.1082761	-0.2182	-0.11602256543	0.859656910	12099	11715	11722.413	11829.934	2.9757309	3.05165	0.0363	0.0872935098342	1.025512711	18471	10689	17896.036	10824.465	4.3747783	2.6961441	-0.6983	-0.403644341228	0.616292712	11204	13593	10843.352	13670.062	2.6159692	3.1749165	0.2794	-0.181254602647	1.213667313	5425	4616	5078.5285	4900.4519	1.2654856	1.1759133	-0.1059	-0.0363258953612	0.92921914	17501	19323	16957.076	19342.978	3.7401622	4.4078891	0.2370	-0.140194618353	1.178528815	5612	4736	5266.6913	5018.1844	1.2302674	1.1317965	-0.1204	0.0376658831371	0.919959716	3712	4240	3397.9969	4533.2838	0.8017233	1.0298062	0.3612	-0.148954887672	1.284490617	1467	1018	1289.9168	1203.8618	0.2852268	0.2674179	-0.0930	0.184154969724	0.937562318	7801	6923	7472.8242	7149.91	1.7403079	1.6819186	-0.0492	-0.0319970992344	0.966448819	3716	2563	3401.9981	2852.952	0.7948249	0.6827453	-0.2193	-0.00169958657786	0.858988320	2834	2290	2548.5001	2571.438	0.7281942	0.7523433	0.0471	-0.161959957528	1.0331629!sample_table_end
