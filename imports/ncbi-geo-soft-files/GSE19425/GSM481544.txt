Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481544/suppl/GSM481544_EL164.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6094	6754	6103.453	6684.6652	1.6468173	1.7676252	0.1021	0.145043247271	1.07335832	5124	4563	5147.2257	4476.5571	1.5406124	1.3333328	-0.2085	-0.0595305991457	0.86545633	3451	3450	3519.4616	3358.3226	1.1645828	1.081322	-0.1070	-0.128768105036	0.92850594	13052	10871	12752.342	10773.342	3.9609448	3.335866	-0.2478	-0.100636823619	0.84218945	19558	17527	18905.353	17298.93	6.166892	5.1746684	-0.2531	0.0128565402083	0.83910476	7195	7233	7149.7531	7163.7926	2.6860164	2.5532803	-0.0731	-0.129382343155	0.95058257	1949	1838	2044.4601	1758.9389	0.7115001	0.588965	-0.2727	-0.199528834926	0.82777918	2866	2619	2952.4984	2525.2034	0.8415789	0.7407832	-0.1840	-0.181467504999	0.88023029	2950	3369	3035.0103	3278.0596	0.8476521	0.9310645	0.1354	0.118815255927	1.098404110	11713	12147	11468.283	12032.833	3.4309313	3.7649659	0.1340	0.0915904390129	1.097359711	16596	14345	16129.144	14198.425	4.5899084	4.2149972	-0.1229	-0.164755081715	0.918318312	14868	12753	14490.358	12636.497	4.7727356	4.171606	-0.1942	-0.242242873043	0.874049213	5094	5984	5117.6522	5915.4213	1.5706425	1.873447	0.2543	0.137802392973	1.192790114	15594	14511	15175.037	14361.573	4.7172415	4.1220532	-0.1946	-0.048316530971	0.87382715	3168	3829	3246.7356	3737.9001	0.9284303	1.0984451	0.2426	0.138163471342	1.183120616	2566	3343	2656.9153	3252.3045	0.8443649	1.0229234	0.2768	0.0291632222074	1.211470817	1000	1102	1092.25	1039.1689	0.3213764	0.2999348	-0.0996	-0.0527046270078	0.933281918	5466	5726	5484.5675	5655.2083	1.7435118	1.5228062	-0.1953	-0.278339434011	0.873413119	2535	2630	2626.1729	2536.3962	0.7940989	0.7935376	-0.0010	0.032482172199	0.999293220	2754	2967	2842.0449	2877.0355	0.7795935	0.8651205	0.1502	0.11553776495	1.1097072!sample_table_end
