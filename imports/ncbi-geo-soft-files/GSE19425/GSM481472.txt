Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481472/suppl/GSM481472_DE367.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4354	2569	3120.2179	3427.7551	1.4490826	1.7387006	0.2629	0.144907812584	1.1998632	2230	1053	1594.7179	1486.6099	0.9550047	0.8574406	-0.1555	-0.0427754308196	0.89783913	5638	2553	4044.8456	3407.5343	1.5070658	1.5609071	0.0506	0.210253940588	1.03572594	7224	2596	5215.2405	3461.8653	1.9382333	1.5932823	-0.2827	-0.0450654569401	0.82202825	8830	4429	6409.4313	5763.9981	3.4552393	3.4247873	-0.0128	-0.0117878857395	0.99118676	11829	5245	8619.8823	6772.9891	3.3628648	3.3049226	-0.0251	-0.111735307518	0.982777	1768	1250	1265.7429	1736.2347	0.9518341	1.0875443	0.1923	0.0707123180229	1.14257768	2867	1037	2050.5544	1464.8175	0.6483468	0.6159075	-0.0741	-0.0126658315014	0.94996629	3185	2127	2270.6542	2866.5734	1.2843435	1.5669899	0.2870	-0.0436616925945	1.220070810	16201	10739	11791.806	13925.33	5.8724843	6.6125091	0.1712	0.129239620025	1.126015611	22922	12712	16511.021	16546.567	7.2155262	7.6941308	0.0927	-0.0470694379921	1.066329812	3435	1794	2448.7823	2433.3803	1.4341968	1.3089586	-0.1318	-0.0582978888761	0.912677113	3457	3315	2465.2408	4368.8937	2.1960022	2.6451163	0.2685	-0.0373093315513	1.204514414	3114	2369	2223.082	3175.1415	2.0300146	2.3004048	0.1804	-0.0843032254614	1.133196215	3909	2189	2802.6526	2946.2484	1.3563092	1.4206355	0.0669	0.00362929145571	1.047427516	3205	2463	2284.207	3293.6651	1.5223742	1.7925564	0.2357	0.0694200608965	1.177474217	1717	1063	1229.0274	1499.5854	0.7347234	0.823243	0.1641	0.0946187556066	1.120480118	8475	3191	6143.1741	4212.0592	2.4713013	2.3315527	-0.0840	0.0703040002614	0.943451419	4541	3147	3251.3059	4156.3545	1.9507812	2.2231776	0.1886	-0.00143405887813	1.139634520	2391	1228	1711.1607	1708.2364	0.8723773	0.8074394	-0.1116	-0.134705435504	0.9255621!sample_table_end
