Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481575/suppl/GSM481575_EL637.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3282	3487	3632.113	3114.2187	0.9067006	0.7609995	0.2527	-0.0165919740369	1.19146012	4193	4826	4579.0416	4335.5231	1.3114579	1.1733793	0.1605	0.165378163598	1.11767593	2503	2767	2801.4527	2461.252	0.7493747	0.6661359	0.1699	0.155243423721	1.12495774	14231	16128	14315.354	15180.856	4.0942672	4.2337303	-0.0483	-0.117210712787	0.9670595	11834	23964	12052.909	22765.183	3.5749008	6.4579412	-0.8532	-0.317269839443	0.55356666	10735	11073	11022.116	10235.572	3.3163878	3.0501675	0.1207	-0.019207163471	1.08728057	1588	2913	1816.9348	2593.3045	0.8008916	1.0304236	-0.3636	0.021282000679	0.77724498	2403	2880	2696.8852	2563.7174	0.822537	0.7801294	0.0764	-0.00209258793218	1.05435979	3486	4266	3843.369	3824.4368	1.046894	0.9806544	0.0943	-0.0326852116957	1.067546310	11476	13370	11713.417	12476.408	4.4579381	4.6287294	-0.0542	-0.0800436703698	0.963101911	9756	10912	10095.911	10082.008	3.7716046	3.5732023	0.0780	-0.0894798289593	1.05552512	5699	6646	6121.7749	6033.9624	2.7984826	2.4615048	0.1851	0.00864894819946	1.136899113	2048	2555	2315.833	2266.4938	1.1057073	1.0265975	0.1071	-0.012454840627	1.077060214	8003	7736	8425.5768	7064.0775	2.2243342	2.0742093	0.1008	0.00942872916691	1.072376915	2284	2962	2573.3147	2637.2411	1.0516686	0.9929092	0.0829	-0.0372866654124	1.05917916	1832	3512	2080.4557	3137.0728	0.8506003	1.1567369	-0.4435	-0.114132800209	0.735344617	1083	1189	1266.9137	1057.6525	0.3468535	0.2761941	0.3286	0.0924426350577	1.255832418	6265	6220	6685.7491	5647.5012	1.6654934	1.5405241	0.1125	0.0196744478291	1.081121219	2894	3625	3215.1621	3240.4036	0.8574825	0.8162416	0.0711	-0.0497984101883	1.050525320	2231	2306	2516.6878	2045.2412	1.0175611	0.8923901	0.1894	-0.0269056821025	1.1402648!sample_table_end
