Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481759/suppl/GSM481759_JBH529.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2154	977	1845.2578	1264.8252	1.1913926	0.8629483	0.4653	0.190986341906	1.38060712	1285	502	855.3324	794.9422	0.7132856	0.6848664	0.0587	0.246789066533	1.0414963	2160	1289	1851.8547	1562.6768	0.9005177	0.8049033	0.1619	0.04146953346	1.11878984	9938	7414	9954.0068	7038.7991	4.9813453	3.7131182	0.4239	0.0529797844852	1.34155315	13174	12215	13197.006	11333.15	6.2569214	6.074086	0.0428	0.0992737910156	1.03010096	6862	6821	6826.8264	6506.5665	3.746862	3.8761564	-0.0489	-0.0939144142508	0.96664377	2277	1917	1981.8951	2116.0253	1.1043345	1.1897117	-0.1074	-0.105812920033	0.9282378	2311	1654	2020.3948	1882.4672	0.9561096	0.9312389	0.0380	-0.023010029631	1.02670729	1619	1052	1241.9012	1338.709	1.0585539	1.1438987	-0.1119	-0.198879280868	0.925391310	9835	10112	9851.0421	9453.6998	5.6846109	5.2517256	0.1143	0.0139892876734	1.082427211	4179	5991	4053.225	5765.1581	2.1395238	3.0088267	-0.4919	-0.530679483484	0.711082412	7420	5336	7401.9107	5178.9602	3.9378985	2.8506483	0.4661	0.160237779168	1.381404513	2373	1759	2090.6719	1975.3276	1.4293721	1.2639774	0.1774	0.0533521595211	1.130852614	2495	1846	2227.664	2052.8172	2.157556	2.1540273	0.0024	0.0402109951333	1.001638215	2268	1365	1971.7318	1630.1062	0.9824843	0.8089884	0.2803	0.0851749844996	1.214460316	2247	1465	1948.281	1717.5206	0.9760742	0.9130984	0.0962	0.176006621815	1.068969417	1188	356	752.225	643.6189	0.5922629	0.5292043	0.1624	0.196461382452	1.119157318	2224	1846	1922.6671	2052.8172	1.6318021	1.4455496	0.1748	-0.038191307495	1.128845519	1313	576	886.6073	868.0114	0.7369367	0.7445246	-0.0148	-0.108501610981	0.989808420	2495	1430	2227.664	1687.1157	1.4790504	1.065222	0.4735	0.0485318101778	1.3884903!sample_table_end
