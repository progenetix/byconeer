Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481512/suppl/GSM481512_DE429.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2671	2165	2371.3823	2473.0845	0.6377416	0.6605186	0.0506	0.123045551825	1.03571492	4075	4300	3594.2372	4814.9858	1.0382499	1.4113374	0.4429	0.47133221697	1.35934263	4224	3947	3729.0486	4427.7341	0.9075372	1.1415853	0.3310	0.299019882351	1.25789364	15787	15224	14497.241	15519.739	3.1860784	3.6755044	0.2062	0.190626110975	1.15361395	17397	18747	15988.615	18845.392	4.7280883	5.3314302	0.1733	0.197344191242	1.1276086	11920	6750	10909.331	7334.2926	3.0484474	2.0724188	-0.5568	-0.526906330289	0.67982767	4700	2886	4167.9807	3277.6063	1.4145325	1.010826	-0.4848	-0.265194149128	0.71460078	4566	3488	4044.8804	3937.2933	0.8341844	0.8860795	0.0871	0.00977984421581	1.06221049	3678	2659	3246.8657	3027.4595	0.8728462	0.8321829	-0.0688	0.0481000022081	0.953412910	14007	9945	12842.766	10462.056	2.7162557	2.2994548	-0.2403	-0.109468090629	0.846553111	18196	15082	16718.765	15385.239	3.3068167	3.2957108	-0.0049	0.120850095122	0.996641512	10801	14118	9867.5812	14455.424	2.7167111	3.8197388	0.4916	0.235835977671	1.406015713	4785	4543	4246.1354	5077.1822	1.1836247	1.2122251	0.0344	-0.0363234098333	1.024163414	10280	11376	9373.0572	11825.546	2.9279291	3.4617325	0.2416	0.281506451628	1.182314315	3714	2976	3278.4629	3376.9435	0.7374724	0.7577943	0.0392	0.102628840494	1.027556116	2808	2815	2488.4162	3199.8309	0.7163617	0.8486406	0.2445	0.179144374422	1.184653717	1573	997	1427.8459	1148.3611	0.3856982	0.3136893	-0.2981	-0.079373191821	0.813302418	5712	3972	5085.8083	4455.2068	1.7103664	1.4554928	-0.2328	-0.206423005978	0.85098319	2932	2055	2594.4436	2348.6181	0.6801801	0.6275963	-0.1161	0.0916608427668	0.922691320	2818	2317	2496.9385	2641.3854	0.50425	0.5642385	0.1622	0.119296276559	1.1189659!sample_table_end
