Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481619/suppl/GSM481619_EL689.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4076	3568	4267.025	3350.3508	1.1904445	0.9730694	0.2909	-0.0364440368462	1.22339112	2877	3482	3021.3938	3271.576	1.1057066	1.1690701	-0.0804	0.11636209489	0.94583	2730	2231	2872.1585	2140.5539	0.7478523	0.5900233	0.3420	0.437555770896	1.26749624	20026	15823	19426.39	14703.844	5.3045817	4.3533766	0.2851	0.018610247705	1.21849825	16243	26038	16064.132	24490.065	4.891078	7.5144395	-0.6195	0.271502410607	0.65089066	12022	12552	12098.848	11619.791	3.5203628	3.6155655	-0.0385	0.105303813567	0.97366867	2064	2703	2164.608	2562.031	1.1450204	1.2083759	-0.0777	-0.133681481703	0.94756968	2134	2683	2239.8555	2544.0454	0.681766	0.8326724	-0.2885	-0.0908785921377	0.81876859	3102	3669	3259.7912	3441.8668	1.1596303	1.1942337	-0.0424	-0.387762845965	0.971024610	16842	15748	16592.661	14633.019	6.4763241	5.8813872	0.1390	0.299895687498	1.101155811	5896	9485	6115.2571	8768.2182	2.2252259	3.2761419	-0.5580	-0.428750494881	0.679221412	5635	5446	5853.2326	5074.5344	2.8763483	2.4597633	0.2257	0.204376513027	1.169359813	1877	1782	1960.8482	1734.3738	1.0128064	0.8864595	0.1922	0.254466214348	1.142529814	4582	5158	4780.5142	4802.5852	2.0886533	1.8701381	0.1594	0.303111825446	1.116844415	1935	1438	2023.5312	1432.6137	0.8229299	0.5910726	0.4774	0.310996281271	1.392265316	1598	1797	1664.6614	1748.0283	0.7736297	0.7653881	0.0155	-0.0843393682369	1.010767817	713	447	625.4085	561.9065	0.2140483	0.1934363	0.1461	0.0267176375033	1.10655718	5869	5517	6088.216	5140.8482	1.9697888	1.6317107	0.2717	0.355068376266	1.207192419	1672	1515	1746.0456	1500.6455	0.6190274	0.5283281	0.2286	0.29984377063	1.171672320	3103	2809	3260.8452	2659.0459	1.0307577	0.9296187	0.1490	0.00694598689521	1.1087962!sample_table_end
