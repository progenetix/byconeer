Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481798/suppl/GSM481798_MR040.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4523	4162	4481.9139	4186.6288	1.2173817	1.1997148	-0.0211	0.0328006450623	0.98548782	2907	2921	2891.0737	2939.737	0.956335	0.9611059	0.0072	0.126080408156	1.00498873	5050	4815	4994.0842	4836.7547	1.2720962	1.2737352	0.0019	0.0240113889994	1.00128854	11467	10639	11052.61	10804.766	3.0652455	3.1030186	0.0177	-0.0118360897093	1.0123235	21342	19084	19987.313	19844.257	5.5292346	5.8257339	0.0754	-0.0133408660937	1.05362396	13491	11549	12920.591	11757.636	3.6011186	3.3591446	-0.1004	-0.047614601921	0.93280597	4615	4675	4572.3738	4697.1891	1.2606554	1.2949095	0.0387	0.0521799239585	1.02717178	3035	3359	3018.1596	3373.3224	0.7836151	0.9293594	0.2461	0.0614659934446	1.18598989	5585	5803	5509.3006	5854.1147	1.6550889	1.7421588	0.0740	0.0448861955418	1.052607410	17726	17326	16770.856	17928.51	5.0385269	5.3423804	0.0845	0.042729635982	1.06030611	20523	18165	19263.396	18837.665	5.4683644	5.6490242	0.0469	0.0434679791687	1.033037312	7131	7944	6966.3814	8024.6435	1.9592817	2.3244781	0.2466	-0.0188243376865	1.18639313	6356	6251	6242.4744	6306.8616	1.915153	1.9507314	0.0266	-0.0828138387521	1.018577314	7591	9290	7398.4032	9406.907	2.4316446	2.7579244	0.1817	-0.0193440014069	1.134180715	4667	4589	4623.29	4611.4798	1.281504	1.2422319	-0.0449	0.0046339882426	0.969354716	7720	6180	7520.2379	6235.4832	1.8538973	1.6871314	-0.1360	-0.113507413357	0.910045817	2145	1935	2130.547	1968.6598	0.6631037	0.6135396	-0.1121	-0.84276912687	0.925254518	6019	6926	5924.0306	6992.8868	1.8142198	2.2360301	0.3016	0.0430191093023	1.232502319	4144	3962	4109.5694	3983.7315	1.303099	1.2336566	-0.0790	-0.101489539499	0.946709820	2589	2255	2575.0147	2280.2218	0.7305958	0.6301682	-0.2133	-0.120191398317	0.8625402!sample_table_end
