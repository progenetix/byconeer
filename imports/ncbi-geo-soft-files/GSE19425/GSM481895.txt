Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481895/suppl/GSM481895_MR309.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6776	8161	6735.4684	8038.6145	1.5428377	1.8746153	-0.2810	-0.0922055525248	0.82301572	3775	3979	3799.7301	3943.0049	0.9309381	0.9992725	-0.1022	-0.0616335474372	0.93161593	5022	4804	5024.3618	4751.1714	1.2593916	1.1567677	0.1226	-0.0990008728909	1.08871614	13393	16196	13082.872	15844.776	3.3162174	4.1237992	-0.3144	-0.320829648419	0.80416565	16391	23652	15932.585	22933.626	4.689844	6.3908695	-0.4465	-0.389694328412	0.7338356	9269	10714	9136.9586	10519.935	2.3794779	2.7007557	-0.1827	-0.133300386194	0.88104157	1504	1695	1551.8252	1684.3899	0.72553	0.7274751	-0.0039	-0.025793094296	0.99732628	2821	3681	2854.393	3650.0027	0.726269	0.9705928	-0.4184	-0.167328554997	0.74827379	4307	5792	4325.5246	5730.0502	1.0024811	1.3655485	-0.4459	-0.171371342697	0.734123410	7995	9171	7923.0569	9030.4496	2.0750932	2.5357819	-0.2893	-0.23384896413	0.818324811	14382	18447	14017.105	17987.424	3.9140553	5.3430013	-0.4490	-0.288907165707	0.732557412	9351	12045	9214.6471	11827.249	3.486692	4.3662898	-0.3245	-0.364658619849	0.79854813	4102	5633	4124.1943	5574.4339	1.5519853	2.0091517	-0.3725	-0.202139904503	0.77245814	13027	18533	12733.712	18069.211	3.9970427	5.21322	-0.3832	-0.308120933734	0.766712815	3377	4143	3407.2224	4102.0866	1.0712566	1.2976142	-0.2766	-0.13410806851	0.825558716	1814	2959	1863.2365	2929.98	0.7155776	1.0805662	-0.5946	-0.279666157356	0.662224717	2079	2143	2128.8825	2125.6295	0.5264895	0.5467115	-0.0544	0.0115679149039	0.963011718	4798	6016	4805.6228	5947.1656	1.4509559	1.6174003	-0.1567	-0.076611715255	0.897091419	3482	3751	3509.2528	3719.232	0.8687327	0.997387	-0.1992	-0.10914471768	0.871008620	3600	3640	3625.6517	3608.8518	0.6948258	0.7750678	-0.1577	-0.157428212413	0.896471!sample_table_end
