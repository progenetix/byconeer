Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481713/suppl/GSM481713_JBH211.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3921	4907	4422.4505	4363.8052	0.9233201	0.7692564	0.2634	0.167511952584	1.2002762	6940	7019	7546.4176	6257.268	1.8517414	1.2759014	0.5374	0.343125566583	1.45132013	4153	4618	4661.8577	4094.1958	0.9577376	0.7299111	0.3919	0.240966860032	1.31212914	13001	13459	13364.785	12214.038	2.7131625	2.2327271	0.2812	0.195867504844	1.21517875	18549	18375	18399.255	16972.786	4.1682369	3.6713541	0.1831	0.0689565013368	1.13534046	10179	12888	10715.255	11680.966	2.3506672	2.2509025	0.0626	0.193528530238	1.04432217	3082	3169	3533.9542	2824.5586	0.6944007	0.6513923	0.0922	-0.0182049972255	1.06602528	3523	4747	4006.2404	4214.9806	0.7974882	0.8280933	-0.0543	-0.0575822443305	0.96304149	3501	5116	3983.0363	4551.0916	0.9711784	0.9248079	0.0706	0.12584917763	1.050140610	12829	12859	13205.529	11653.272	2.7099438	2.5804064	0.0707	0.132654749389	1.050200411	16619	16014	16681.465	14698.25	3.3791212	3.1544029	0.0993	0.0747440846926	1.071239512	6343	6210	6955.3418	5521.1455	1.2174068	1.2148959	0.0030	0.0971371913292	1.002066613	6517	4876	7130.7003	4335.9449	1.1857827	0.9111779	0.3800	0.168035308641	1.301373414	12075	12574	12505.916	11381.251	3.6434885	2.5474175	0.5163	0.445340555978	1.430267515	7006	5709	7612.1356	5068.247	1.2579141	1.0610738	0.2455	0.13553053576	1.185510416	6817	6010	7424.966	5339.507	1.2848533	1.1532486	0.1559	0.159387898471	1.114116517	1370	1572	1653.5911	1448.4783	0.3957949	0.2942054	0.4279	0.203597349617	1.34530118	5368	8204	5939.2645	7367.4795	1.3586883	1.3802867	-0.0228	0.0299975615654	0.984352219	3476	4872	3956.6635	4332.1918	0.9257832	0.8804098	0.0725	0.0325934623376	1.051536620	3796	4953	4294.7333	4405.02	0.8612289	0.845895	0.0259	0.00991152615202	1.0181274!sample_table_end
