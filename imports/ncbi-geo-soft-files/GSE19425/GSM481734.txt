Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481734/suppl/GSM481734_JBH406.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3202	3709	3326.0921	3590.5371	1.0854181	1.0003656	-0.1177	-0.0806881271465	0.92164082	4339	5070	4475.618	4883.1767	1.7668121	1.6694694	-0.0818	-0.152423892771	0.94490493	5290	5404	5440.4022	5206.4445	1.3379601	1.1572588	-0.2093	0.0016604517044	0.86494264	16064	13227	15885.81	12706.248	3.9916105	3.1052564	-0.3623	-0.264766979896	0.77794575	24778	19435	23845.537	18766.55	5.447342	3.9730956	-0.4553	-0.356616242084	0.72936416	9714	9527	9840.9011	9116.9478	2.7523802	2.2302481	-0.3035	-0.276999805112	0.81029797	5745	4668	5902.5278	4502.0267	0.9359807	0.8206871	-0.1896	-0.159980916671	0.87682058	4098	3290	4229.9	3205.411	0.7620675	0.6599301	-0.2076	-0.0648242477903	0.86597329	2583	2950	2697.307	2882.3385	1.1714013	1.1260335	-0.0570	-0.218589185548	0.961270410	20331	19195	19814.907	18528.837	3.5294134	3.5969319	0.0273	-0.0768085340615	1.019130211	25776	21107	24732.898	20407.317	4.2558537	3.9870794	-0.0941	-0.295341180715	0.936845912	17698	15956	17398.332	15356.742	2.7281658	2.9286958	0.1023	-0.14703102296	1.073503513	11729	9990	11798.848	9554.4428	1.7250267	1.8089929	0.0686	0.035675564326	1.048675314	8919	10696	9078.2782	10241.421	4.2446015	3.959408	-0.1003	-0.137339994879	0.932810315	6199	6659	6366.6344	6410.8434	1.1503387	1.1742783	0.0297	0.0390049998776	1.020810916	8023	6946	8180.5356	6681.1918	1.1550624	1.1865755	0.0388	-0.00720783383053	1.027282617	1452	1957	1533.4892	1922.7753	0.55403	0.5645667	0.0272	0.101424175122	1.019018218	5622	7327	5776.5173	7036.8862	1.5322883	1.579312	0.0436	-0.0922420322326	1.030688519	3120	4199	3243.7614	4060.8355	1.1042458	1.1561786	0.0663	0.0710820673665	1.047030120	4026	3017	4158.7652	2946.802	0.6922664	0.5817392	-0.2510	-0.0886367265979	0.8403399!sample_table_end
