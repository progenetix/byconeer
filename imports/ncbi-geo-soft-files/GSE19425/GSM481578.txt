Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481578/suppl/GSM481578_EL640.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2807	2133	2835.7718	2106.4153	0.7926522	0.6612666	-0.2615	-0.0572344472191	0.83424572	3114	2766	3142.097	2719.6175	1.0544593	1.0212384	-0.0462	-0.0196736558941	0.96849483	4367	3056	4392.4937	3006.8575	1.0591873	0.8098213	-0.3873	-0.141152279183	0.76456854	15636	12869	15307.276	12640.836	4.8756539	4.4257829	-0.1397	-0.0825716054917	0.90773115	9003	13128	8920.0339	12902.01	2.9457687	4.2907993	0.5426	-0.140164219259	1.45659746	14923	12237	14634.205	12004.728	3.9627341	3.5888252	-0.1430	-0.0310430429184	0.90564377	1237	1761	1269.9506	1739.0311	0.7550514	0.8501038	0.1711	-0.107649000929	1.12588868	2327	2277	2356.4233	2247.817	0.9396288	0.899932	-0.0623	0.0629351404415	0.95775269	4254	3750	4282.1695	3674.1282	1.4267389	1.3749773	-0.0533	0.0202074628939	0.963720310	10258	10509	10142.523	10287.753	5.1479251	4.9992352	-0.0423	-0.0357789753202	0.971116511	5590	4539	5593.0823	4430.8768	2.8842139	2.2560777	-0.3544	-0.0761194358818	0.782215812	5472	5142	5477.6938	5024.4241	3.0791872	2.5942449	-0.2472	-0.080009007517	0.842509613	1829	1841	1865.1877	1816.979	1.3579857	1.2052512	-0.1721	-0.0697798321613	0.887528614	7134	5480	7100.7195	5360.3285	2.0015563	1.6930413	-0.2415	-0.189126344216	0.845862415	2142	2021	2175.0415	1995.7047	1.1874329	1.0120134	-0.2306	-0.0434782798264	0.852269916	1934	2433	1969.9885	2399.6089	1.0982603	1.2006128	0.1286	0.0189729469473	1.093195117	1722	1173	1755.9941	1164.6361	0.5808776	0.4327972	-0.4245	-0.173063768393	0.745074618	6897	5197	6869.2896	5079.0177	1.6466863	1.3798938	-0.2550	-0.080129957498	0.837982219	2414	2175	2443.4204	2147.7015	1.0686181	0.8951333	-0.2556	-0.102540549278	0.83765520	3720	3004	3751.5315	2955.7396	1.5740399	1.2758551	-0.3030	-0.0821625520308	0.8105608!sample_table_end
