Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481686/suppl/GSM481686_JA950.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6006	5013	5779.1402	5156.4871	1.4805232	1.2626747	-0.2296	-0.0709536553602	0.85285712	3434	3799	3281.6223	3940.832	0.8850786	1.0606666	0.2611	0.192125596178	1.19838693	7329	5592	7060.4944	5738.6142	1.8351569	1.3995621	-0.3909	-0.106325828029	0.76263894	9344	10630	8991.2293	10777.525	2.4085252	2.7420135	0.1871	0.145441649021	1.13846165	13475	15435	12956.732	15646.878	4.0059122	4.478945	0.1610	0.00388024349047	1.11808366	9463	9019	9104.2104	9150.9723	2.4639112	2.2907555	-0.1051	-0.0726757176859	0.92972327	2022	2164	1922.8679	2275.024	0.7806361	0.9088373	0.2194	0.127267970826	1.16422658	3051	2970	2914.4421	3097.1499	0.8373429	0.9107943	0.1213	0.158454661483	1.08771969	5183	5199	4970.1376	5341.259	1.2820215	1.3900826	0.1168	0.0320915308756	1.084289610	7572	6678	7294.0798	6821.75	2.8469993	2.7399722	-0.0553	-0.131438184116	0.96240711	16693	11287	16027.407	11442.741	5.6642035	4.4045408	-0.3629	-0.182570670106	0.777609912	5318	5199	5102.7686	5341.259	1.895934	2.0319994	0.1000	0.0412410193802	1.071766913	3305	2688	3156.9679	2812.7928	1.9100634	1.8883782	-0.0165	0.0515928919987	0.988646914	10851	13088	10445.756	13266.839	2.8634056	3.6340866	0.3439	0.0936411649227	1.269148315	5515	4860	5296.4391	5005.6138	1.7776063	1.7408278	-0.0302	-0.0350009028027	0.979310116	3917	3374	3750.5656	3512.6614	1.3716831	1.2803504	-0.0994	-0.105231119423	0.933415517	3089	2442	2950.8896	2560.359	0.772234	0.6620237	-0.2222	-0.00882489408431	0.857283818	5576	4659	5356.4295	4806.0307	1.6311601	1.3749382	-0.2465	-0.0775618239573	0.842920419	4778	3667	4580.8935	3809.356	1.2662921	1.0908179	-0.2152	-0.124557763674	0.861426720	1196	928	1128.9478	1007.5102	0.5260342	0.4936041	-0.0918	-0.0157612844544	0.9383498!sample_table_end
