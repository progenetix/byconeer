Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481470/suppl/GSM481470_DE365.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1007	741	930.1703	817.5267	1.2867361	1.0940976	-0.2340	-0.204127712732	0.85028912	829	676	760.5699	750.6634	0.7043386	0.72093	0.0336	0.177148574915	1.0235563	1277	849	1190.1803	926.8506	1.2997374	1.0128823	-0.3598	-0.147159817505	0.77929774	1224	1411	1138.65	1475.1655	1.1651361	1.5071446	0.3713	0.251174446272	1.29353535	2934	4174	2735.1573	4216.6209	3.2265447	4.8408258	0.5853	0.389552494871	1.50031276	2281	2089	2153.1936	2122.3096	2.5259888	2.4070623	-0.0696	-0.161951967775	0.95291887	1240	1177	1154.1956	1253.1728	0.9210611	1.0149911	0.1401	0.016763011975	1.10198038	1078	878	997.3591	956.2756	0.6049563	0.6273952	0.0525	0.0604139269503	1.03709189	2284	1750	2155.9439	1798.2278	1.864878	1.5455281	-0.2710	-0.137816013597	0.828755610	819	594	751.0039	662.8752	0.8731976	0.8854109	0.0200	-0.243496012263	1.013986911	15505	10906	12753.534	11966.414	7.7822215	7.5744965	-0.0390	-0.236511937099	0.973307812	1480	1851	1388.4487	1895.4637	1.0632459	1.4466193	0.4442	0.313911950239	1.36056913	5318	3512	4764.5705	3514.692	2.5135237	1.9318516	-0.3797	-0.322658499845	0.76858314	1242	1396	1156.14	1461.0157	1.554216	2.0784836	0.4193	0.130222128284	1.337319615	3958	2443	3613.5286	2455.851	2.409702	1.6560458	-0.5411	-0.283674368798	0.687240916	1802	1230	1700.7266	1305.1294	1.2903001	0.9892536	-0.3833	-0.274763270813	0.766684917	1301	1016	1213.9896	1094.8144	1.1842633	1.1152588	-0.0866	-0.00394674989003	0.941732118	784	631	717.4427	703.335	0.9857571	0.9163758	-0.1053	-0.129825608368	0.929616219	1052	950	972.774	1028.3128	1.0922657	1.0522139	-0.0539	-0.262548362967	0.963331520	1463	888	1372.492	966.3546	0.9982084	0.7271628	-0.4571	-0.0361497885577	0.7284679!sample_table_end
