Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481707/suppl/GSM481707_JBH203.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6724	7651	7011.0097	7207.7125	1.7889056	1.6883129	0.0835	0.0760560821812	1.05958172	3569	4757	3753.7396	4483.5427	1.2835693	1.371292	-0.0954	-0.0353710577458	0.93602913	4367	4336	4578.3822	4095.8634	1.0826865	0.9389985	0.2054	0.11049701555	1.15302274	7186	8583	7492.784	8096.0239	1.9790096	2.094425	-0.0818	-0.171549838872	0.9448945	15371	18566	15778.864	17835.857	4.0537247	4.7043274	-0.2147	-0.255975118498	0.86170126	8983	8485	9330.6492	8003.1524	2.2956988	1.9008047	0.2723	0.250592366093	1.2077517	2589	2495	2728.4814	2379.2133	0.8530251	0.8227027	0.0522	0.165691764461	1.0368578	2715	2569	2858.3851	2448.6212	0.7853578	0.6662858	0.2372	0.0917492487688	1.178719	7919	9826	8246.3162	9289.948	2.771129	2.7721038	-0.0005	0.0444304923022	0.999648310	10755	11740	11132.851	11150.829	3.5169141	3.6349214	-0.0476	-0.01632107965	0.967535111	18289	18091	18702.516	17370.959	6.2392256	5.8133409	0.1020	0.0753108190071	1.073259912	3578	4096	3763.1485	3868.6066	1.154145	1.3505	-0.2267	-0.114348595037	0.854605713	5281	5590	5531.5702	5264.7378	1.8270906	1.8912757	-0.0498	0.0869118641671	0.966062514	6475	9335	6753.3042	8813.229	2.4430502	2.7672152	-0.1798	-0.151759378719	0.882855215	4457	4580	4670.6199	4321.2366	1.3924143	1.3723057	0.0210	0.0560232654992	1.014653116	4089	4282	4293.0093	4044.6913	1.2053986	1.2430737	-0.0444	0.0293539345402	0.96969217	2085	2573	2197.4149	2452.3638	0.6703238	0.6858257	-0.0330	0.0387623315333	0.977396718	5879	6106	6138.7291	5756.2801	1.6608705	1.5023169	0.1448	0.16838081223	1.105539419	3403	4055	3581.5735	3830.1819	1.0684872	1.0637914	0.0064	0.081401261122	1.004414220	2075	2484	2187.0316	2368.8428	0.6384743	0.6743528	-0.0789	-0.112919569016	0.9467956!sample_table_end
