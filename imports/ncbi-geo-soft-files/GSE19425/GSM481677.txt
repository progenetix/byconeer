Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481677/suppl/GSM481677_JA943.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	909	643	887.8642	671.6446	0.6823544	0.5345759	0.3521	0.0915166467755	1.27644052	1544	1229	1518.8379	1247.322	1.4235539	1.2285999	0.2125	0.182496916685	1.15867973	1668	1563	1642.7464	1580.247	0.9025126	0.7835625	0.2039	-0.0199123415758	1.15180674	9521	7984	8875.6964	8324.6209	4.9368121	4.5573215	0.1154	0.0886356658476	1.08327055	10736	10553	9949.5556	11120.16	6.3415545	6.8622115	-0.1138	0.0743770540843	0.92412696	6559	6045	6222.6162	6241.8553	3.6144672	3.4872459	0.0517	-0.0766593503681	1.03648187	1268	1188	1246.3006	1207.2569	1.3836759	1.3780047	0.0059	0.0897181992871	1.00411548	2878	2846	2811.6651	2879.4427	1.5601521	1.5173487	0.0401	0.104538757169	1.02820939	1112	1085	1093.057	1107.5328	1.0004647	1.0629904	-0.0875	-0.088722946226	0.941179410	3464	3289	3367.7358	3329.0973	2.0731117	2.0011322	0.0510	0.0883680944246	1.035969311	4610	4228	4442.9997	4310.8188	2.5074431	2.5089575	-0.0009	-0.124276828197	0.999396412	2384	2307	2333.2919	2326.0768	1.8134163	1.8323772	-0.0150	0.138765198912	0.989652313	873	1029	850.6265	1052.7834	0.7018563	0.8511336	-0.2782	-0.165919485333	0.824613514	3083	2381	3007.3937	2401.493	3.449022	2.8707679	0.2648	0.294169601836	1.201428315	1786	1451	1758.4709	1468.2895	1.0106976	0.852195	0.2461	0.0957103115422	1.185993316	924	821	903.1332	847.5919	0.7411139	0.7285908	0.0246	0.101513732954	1.017188117	482	364	459.8987	395.3516	0.4005908	0.3760013	0.0914	-0.0295349982193	1.065397418	1890	2111	1857.7459	2127.4405	1.1452427	1.4376039	-0.3280	-0.217390126058	0.79663319	750	630	724.5348	658.6228	0.616579	0.6099691	0.0155	-0.0875924055912	1.010836420	666	585	640.5926	613.3957	0.3894812	0.3426702	0.1847	0.00665794353317	1.1366064!sample_table_end
