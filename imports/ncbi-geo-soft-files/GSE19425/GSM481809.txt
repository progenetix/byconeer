Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481809/suppl/GSM481809_MR061.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4168	4293	4086.3435	4346.3861	1.1834859	1.1301537	0.0665	0.130727692438	1.04719022	3608	3939	3557.7741	3991.7215	1.0785406	1.0833458	-0.0064	-0.0702745725571	0.99556453	3428	2396	3385.056	2411.9236	0.9753747	0.6503508	0.5847	0.449276742752	1.49976694	9831	9814	9349.3992	9764.002	2.7518	2.7413891	0.0055	-0.120488085365	1.00379765	11254	13025	10646.448	12990.349	3.0195553	3.5864432	-0.2482	-0.447113112623	0.84193596	7657	7795	7364.9365	7776.8389	2.2551516	2.2242856	0.0199	-0.0348585221465	1.01387677	3027	2650	3006.6567	2671.865	0.7548521	0.7224651	0.0633	-0.0893134436838	1.04482848	2650	2862	2663.7896	2892.614	0.7368523	0.7880491	-0.0969	-0.0119496968659	0.93503359	4972	4873	4836.7039	4920.7626	1.3678247	1.2713247	0.1056	0.072894829782	1.07590510	11540	11468	10905.409	11431.736	3.2310905	3.3553075	-0.0544	-0.00836469645797	0.962978911	19517	16917	18005.462	17025.181	5.1594181	4.7689171	0.1135	0.0356374217381	1.081884612	8941	6760	8545.3092	6767.5461	2.1427804	1.9205139	0.1580	0.274653484279	1.115732813	7337	6297	7060.858	6317.2395	2.0249202	1.8453402	0.1340	0.168060219508	1.097315314	9235	9916	8809.5484	9867.3177	2.672111	2.7553736	-0.0443	-0.0973266467257	0.969781715	5263	3660	5109.5958	3717.5759	1.159103	0.9867621	0.2322	0.144952958893	1.174652816	4306	4167	4219.7668	4219.0947	1.0594646	1.1225632	-0.0835	0.127819596546	0.943790617	1375	1254	1470.2667	1249.3113	0.4433076	0.3355088	0.4020	0.197740486542	1.321299618	4438	5955	4347.3271	5991.638	1.1769817	1.4961581	-0.3462	-0.131615663472	0.786669319	3389	3443	3347.2721	3493.2854	1.0391523	0.9697811	0.0997	0.0939001902651	1.071532820	1914	2196	1974.3548	2202.9091	0.5663297	0.6307451	-0.1554	-0.160603624844	0.8978742!sample_table_end
