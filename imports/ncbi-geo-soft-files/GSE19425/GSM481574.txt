Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481574/suppl/GSM481574_EL636.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2119	1687	2016.2622	1787.4877	0.9584537	0.8409202	-0.1887	0.0219083502589	0.87737172	1275	1344	1209.4453	1431.9621	0.8049103	0.8704304	0.1129	0.114016204162	1.08140043	3760	3196	3610.184	3293.3949	1.1860813	1.1743368	-0.0144	0.123438419367	0.9900984	13911	12560	13399.23	12324.529	5.9111318	5.6255928	-0.0714	0.086675763742	0.95169465	10603	15666	10264.546	15334.702	3.216242	5.0105604	0.6396	0.0256669838395	1.55789286	11176	9900	10809.239	9768.7241	4.0076956	3.8765671	-0.0480	0.0118163452117	0.96728087	1858	2747	1765.3955	2854.5767	0.6749141	0.9958609	0.5612	0.240137103591	1.47553728	1968	1752	1870.7493	1852.9888	0.9823749	0.9203806	-0.0940	0.0553215894963	0.93689339	2643	2425	2526.6921	2532.2137	1.7669636	1.5952744	-0.1475	-0.138535751708	0.902833710	11450	11932	11069.435	11720.344	6.5098718	6.4190885	-0.0203	-0.0573258508727	0.986054511	5372	5607	5190.4364	5640.6599	3.0709162	3.2248468	0.0706	0.217209494486	1.050125312	7114	7949	6897.1882	7899.0049	3.5406848	3.591407	0.0205	0.0915410189411	1.014325513	2014	1709	1915.0024	1809.7364	1.2459184	1.1392884	-0.1291	0.00450901467832	0.914416514	5823	5108	5632.4355	5159.1481	2.2703569	2.234572	-0.0229	0.108120010581	0.984238215	2043	1976	1942.9549	2077.8086	1.0417682	0.979925	-0.0883	0.104379201916	0.940636316	2304	2957	2195.3946	3062.9797	0.9317489	1.1701265	0.3287	0.101533230544	1.255838817	838	656	790.1608	717.70209	0.5040552	0.4151381	-0.2800	0.00823616324006	0.823596318	6948	5325	6734.5756	5367.4901	1.8292374	1.6622593	-0.1381	0.0514476976567	0.908717119	1413	1162	1341.0128	1243.2805	1.0161517	0.8653522	-0.2318	-0.00765254961162	0.851597420	2973	2278	2847.388	2385.443	1.7564276	1.3560528	-0.3732	-0.0861202953951	0.7720516!sample_table_end
