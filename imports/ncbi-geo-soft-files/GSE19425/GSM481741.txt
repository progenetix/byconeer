Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481741/suppl/GSM481741_JBH497.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4331	3306	4155.645	3368.6191	2.3175837	1.9438302	0.2537	-0.0458004579799	1.19227682	2716	2249	2613.8086	2311.0454	1.4327988	1.3196001	0.1187	0.164218225806	1.08578263	1776	1543	1708.045	1601.597	0.9821267	0.931752	0.0760	-0.0929022405638	1.05406464	8727	7789	8276.9888	7921.9463	4.6873601	4.5781667	0.0340	0.0179444209887	1.02385095	15315	13484	14253.262	13756.153	8.8896324	8.9019017	-0.0020	0.14118124565	0.99862176	4347	4407	4170.8953	4489.3659	2.529991	2.8540831	-0.1739	0.0194206771284	0.88644627	1460	1516	1397.4587	1574.1965	0.9245069	0.9884992	-0.0966	0.0255063999078	0.93526328	1329	1332	1268.4697	1389.6754	0.8441885	0.9335745	-0.1452	-0.0238943932754	0.9042549	4437	4086	4256.7257	4162.0345	2.242945	2.2307546	0.0079	-0.100368936562	1.005464710	4292	4443	4118.5542	4526.3459	3.5523524	3.9973224	-0.1703	0.181926258263	0.88868311	6981	7009	6643.8882	7126.798	5.0483121	5.5666464	-0.1410	-0.238228496939	0.906885712	5912	5337	5645.3635	5431.5684	3.8191157	3.6383801	0.0699	-0.0224739361686	1.049674713	2391	2554	2296.7901	2618.599	1.9916982	2.2878313	-0.2000	-0.161867585775	0.870561714	14899	11548	13875.208	11763.939	8.8474362	8.0003269	0.1452	0.144533017585	1.105884315	1306	1362	1245.8568	1419.6462	0.8657856	0.9984183	-0.2056	-0.263006902558	0.867157116	1687	1830	1621.5768	1891.3639	1.0957445	1.2293098	-0.1659	-0.125735318586	0.891349317	674	551	609.9798	618.1069	0.3506305	0.3699648	-0.0774	-0.195924643777	0.9477418	2520	3713	2423.1065	3781.6475	1.2374813	1.954356	-0.6593	-0.350381285393	0.633191319	1311	1089	1250.7717	1146.116	0.8308908	0.7667641	0.1159	0.159897809485	1.083632920	1786	1509	1717.7597	1567.0906	1.2538791	1.1766632	0.0917	0.0207290464464	1.0656227!sample_table_end
