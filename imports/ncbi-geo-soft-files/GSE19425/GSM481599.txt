Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481599/suppl/GSM481599_EL663.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3477	2729	3505.2959	2678.8201	0.7959307	0.6622336	0.2653	-0.0118700981863	1.20188812	4494	3517	4488.1373	3463.7081	1.124121	0.926082	0.2796	0.0609314121715	1.2138463	2666	2330	2713.299	2288.078	0.7511961	0.6275185	0.2595	0.0762322114019	1.197094	12701	13511	12349.86	13439.479	3.188099	3.5224852	-0.1439	-0.0557443294158	0.90507095	15667	24367	15153.72	24624.095	5.1480235	7.8198997	-0.6031	0.0543168561783	0.65832346	10103	10654	9902.8959	10560.555	2.94048	3.1909705	-0.1179	-0.111219460169	0.92150027	1424	2613	1498.3388	2566.5331	0.8831947	1.2811041	-0.5366	-0.205622764081	0.68940128	2846	3520	2885.8	3466.7517	0.7817362	0.936689	-0.2609	-0.0489542650209	0.83457389	3985	3975	3998.4462	3926.1907	0.9438548	0.97546	-0.0475	-0.0794990123923	0.967599710	16091	16830	15553.759	16824.072	4.4794314	4.9083542	-0.1319	0.0348033811507	0.912613711	11139	10029	10873.89	9935.1149	3.1253477	2.8319133	0.1422	-0.061095327772	1.10361712	5220	5723	5196.6722	5663.7468	2.4088211	2.3567669	0.0315	-0.0107458723411	1.022087113	1321	1508	1397.4327	1474.257	0.560256	0.5483678	0.0309	0.102652085132	1.021679214	9936	9165	9745.3313	9084.3926	3.1555573	2.8759918	0.1338	0.0124332290086	1.097206615	2069	2136	2123.4788	2094.6903	0.7127038	0.6596042	0.1117	0.0875092783104	1.080502216	1503	2059	1574.8444	2017.6587	0.7620211	0.8721115	-0.1947	0.137855498401	0.873765617	686	641	744.424	632.9043	0.1859208	0.1702923	0.1267	-0.0103118555214	1.091774718	5013	5059	4992.527	5010.3085	1.5223073	1.5047943	0.0167	-0.0980232649649	1.011638119	2465	2173	2519.208	2131.5144	0.6045069	0.5663146	0.0942	0.0351185260806	1.0674420	3340	2523	3369.281	2479.1947	0.8066293	0.6412854	0.3309	0.0151455591047	1.2578318!sample_table_end
