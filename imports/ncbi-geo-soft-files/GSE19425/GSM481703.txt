Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481703/suppl/GSM481703_JBH113.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4308	3658	4188.3141	3757.7691	1.2525805	1.1537851	0.1185	0.00153867906185	1.08562712	3114	3162	3027.0524	3256.5317	1.1555793	1.2901765	-0.1590	-0.0538585085273	0.89567543	5254	3387	5108.5726	3485.6015	1.3150308	0.922368	0.5117	0.145574425159	1.42571164	9450	9524	9193.9927	9528.1823	2.4061279	2.6932977	-0.1627	-0.0668038560726	0.89337615	17445	21314	16762.685	21351.042	4.2742731	5.6020398	-0.3903	-0.181317485242	0.76298516	9549	8878	9288.7786	8897.6976	2.5988897	2.5739784	0.0139	-0.0200484710881	1.00967817	4010	3828	3894.4891	3926.0559	0.7867393	0.833623	-0.0835	0.0119159342903	0.94375918	2976	3824	2894.1137	3922.1041	0.8566615	0.9936868	-0.2141	-0.065825770053	0.86210419	4580	4422	4449.7547	4519.7074	1.7483057	1.7923907	-0.0359	-0.00403023831528	0.975404310	17209	15859	16542.149	15825.28	3.6371461	3.1934914	0.1877	0.11413417584	1.138924611	18878	18529	18095.078	18535.659	4.3869068	3.9780254	0.1412	0.075131975236	1.10278512	5544	8781	5394.5137	8801.6126	1.3100031	1.8544232	-0.5014	-0.271893463932	0.706420813	8781	7798	8555.2655	7831.7065	1.7857458	1.6204995	0.1401	0.0629390075524	1.101972414	5912	5677	5751.2757	5753.1957	2.4150673	2.6228545	-0.1191	-0.0484949946835	0.920778215	4927	4445	4784.2815	4542.8396	1.2021403	0.9725766	0.3057	0.0691720042391	1.236036516	4420	4526	4296.1506	4625.3892	1.0229706	0.9710643	0.0751	0.0811050681706	1.053452917	1966	1351	1914.9293	1443.3686	0.6942944	0.5460207	0.3466	0.0687452304874	1.271553318	5717	4586	5563.0105	4686.5308	1.4952164	1.4166938	0.0778	0.0448654975945	1.055426619	4060	2433	3943.5351	2528.6929	1.1758873	0.8680518	0.4379	0.142461145686	1.35462820	3368	3066	3276.7406	3158.9315	0.7238557	0.6475067	0.1608	-0.0480420305762	1.1179122!sample_table_end
