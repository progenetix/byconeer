Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481647/suppl/GSM481647_JA803.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2197	3737	2347.8309	3470.0429	0.9498526	1.2165989	-0.3571	-0.17538122558	0.78074422	1422	2717	1673.0815	2486.7485	1.3441027	1.1387565	0.2392	-0.15055274401	1.18032493	4689	4638	4638.3318	4348.936	1.1140663	1.2078267	-0.1166	0.0833856302217	0.92237274	13064	10750	12204.211	10097.77	2.7079495	2.7188391	-0.0058	-0.251501429157	0.99599485	16840	16661	15660.209	15613.428	3.689585	4.4921388	-0.2839	-0.471277148601	0.82134266	11644	8816	10912.848	8277.0757	2.8909802	2.5430378	0.1850	0.0978666837627	1.13682157	2713	1592	2832.3164	1393.7035	0.9110912	0.6548784	0.4764	0.16103141852	1.39123718	4110	3460	4109.8006	3194.9216	0.7558625	0.7101856	0.0899	-0.0765312670606	1.06431689	1612	4086	1832.9936	3823.4339	1.6066102	1.7167449	-0.0957	-0.290476487092	0.935846810	11234	14793	10540.763	13861.929	2.3191716	3.0151177	-0.3786	0.00749664153463	0.769181111	27684	29256	25621.837	27780.669	5.2029964	6.1637051	-0.2445	-0.115691936476	0.844134612	9878	7472	9319.3729	7007.7676	2.2768358	2.3741439	-0.0604	0.0673186178201	0.959013413	3445	6224	3516.4958	5875.0993	1.0604974	1.7438734	-0.7176	-0.0551044867743	0.608127514	3367	8170	3445.4793	7664.8251	2.8354617	3.6148922	-0.3504	-0.386333211546	0.784383515	9751	8934	9204.8452	8388.1836	1.7286439	2.0237473	-0.2274	0.0480820015901	0.854179716	3904	3935	3922.3248	3669.5934	1.0283406	1.3920023	-0.4368	-0.109206323983	0.738749217	807	1925	1161.1239	1728.882	0.8002228	0.7503252	0.0929	0.0556778142665	1.066501418	3077	4760	3168.4747	4461.2315	1.3558066	1.6716697	-0.3021	0.0237386540311	0.811049319	589	2974	959.7845	2732.5632	0.8133159	1.2568494	-0.6279	0.00709501168277	0.647106920	1192	1778	1472.5862	1581.1469	0.6544951	0.5082219	0.3649	-0.0201439566514	1.2878137!sample_table_end
