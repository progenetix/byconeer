Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481561/suppl/GSM481561_EL623.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2657	2518	2883.419	2298.4817	0.8744337	0.6637152	0.3978	0.120780836162	1.31748322	5164	4929	5456.7493	4570.3292	1.8045434	1.437983	0.3276	0.149179878488	1.25491283	3157	2962	3405.3674	2707.9285	1.0359275	0.795468	0.3810	0.171363644715	1.30228684	10210	11472	10360.563	11013.08	3.3955949	3.6931653	-0.1212	0.00748817372451	0.91942675	12157	17701	12189.252	17305.646	4.1698504	5.8119847	-0.4790	0.0291045472933	0.71745726	7131	8407	7401.0777	7958.445	2.3772745	2.5929347	-0.1253	-0.221057694843	0.91682777	2070	3145	2267.6213	2880.551	0.8753031	1.058558	-0.2742	0.0363988158846	0.82688258	2022	2685	2217.1018	2450.2493	0.7325962	0.8540916	-0.2214	-0.160346957324	0.8577499	2775	3902	3007.2818	3589.647	0.9329135	1.0380998	-0.1541	-0.00570532400555	0.898674210	10347	11688	10489.31	11231.086	3.6110015	4.2768317	-0.2441	-0.139355555563	0.844316911	9873	12641	10041.85	12200.033	3.7102293	4.6725868	-0.3327	-0.450405048048	0.794041812	6321	6249	6606.9818	5849.544	2.3792838	2.1894707	0.1199	0.108397594398	1.086693613	1681	1948	1859.4386	1772.9229	0.6400679	0.6544463	-0.0321	0.0123199435945	0.978029514	9892	10392	10060.062	9924.6128	3.360834	3.0165577	0.1559	0.0687735667859	1.114128815	2341	2515	2556.6161	2295.7368	0.8422846	0.7958718	0.0818	0.124598912714	1.058316916	2038	2849	2233.9463	2601.7145	0.7835475	0.94157	-0.2650	-0.0150572280886	0.832171217	674	654	781.18492	621.3611	0.2493075	0.1921351	0.3758	0.214879535395	1.297563718	5109	5888	5402.0764	5497.3448	1.6412082	1.5504551	0.0821	-0.0863635847845	1.058533119	1819	1906	2006.0317	1734.5714	0.6099058	0.5510718	0.1463	-0.0301184607031	1.106762820	2361	2325	2577.5318	2119.3101	0.8590401	0.7631434	0.1708	-0.0261652572149	1.1256601!sample_table_end
