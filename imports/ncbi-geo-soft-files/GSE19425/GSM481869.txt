Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481869/suppl/GSM481869_MR279.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4647	4348	4666.1945	4274.507	1.1934621	1.1633193	0.0369	-0.105862010442	1.0259112	5850	5437	5807.3003	5335.2415	1.7483009	1.6155401	0.1139	-0.0334243697315	1.08217743	3740	3388	3781.4455	3344.8852	0.9161241	0.8652383	0.0824	-0.136619330363	1.05881144	17609	16044	16067.289	15823.892	3.7671614	4.1185652	-0.1287	-0.255566359863	0.91467815	20816	20063	18676.779	19810.693	4.7364943	5.1458961	-0.1196	-0.162987744029	0.92044116	10213	9907	9784.9198	9705.07	2.5729468	2.746654	-0.0943	-0.0662916641466	0.93675687	2328	3152	2383.2112	3115.4099	0.8765184	0.8385211	0.0639	0.0425139286911	1.04531468	3453	3562	3496.5117	3519.5321	0.8359133	0.9398585	-0.1691	-0.17568842422	0.88940339	3917	4374	3951.6443	4299.6715	1.1129877	1.1924278	-0.0995	0.0530498728652	0.933379510	13818	12632	12885.41	12471.924	3.5027447	3.6832291	-0.0725	-0.103211237714	0.950998311	12029	15431	11366.846	15210.52	2.8549314	4.3074427	-0.5934	-0.519256127423	0.662790312	10845	12254	10348.476	12095.687	3.1755983	3.2588727	-0.0373	-0.23308296556	0.974446913	3219	4022	3261.6663	3963.1137	1.162704	1.1944327	-0.0388	-0.0619644701224	0.973436214	12099	12031	11426.482	11873.562	3.6914214	3.652461	0.0153	-0.0782903295159	1.010666915	3045	3098	3093.3508	3063.8328	0.801361	0.7772955	0.0440	-0.0114679679815	1.030960616	2486	3578	2534.9876	3535.6667	0.780775	0.9128514	-0.2255	-0.136357506806	0.855314517	1048	953	1084.9925	1011.6431	0.3300349	0.3108496	0.0864	0.0666839921963	1.061718818	4743	6333	4756.8567	6205.8801	1.3868855	1.7081593	-0.3006	-0.255782937561	0.811918119	1807	2103	1865.87	2103.6088	0.5438096	0.6400953	-0.2352	-0.143961443184	0.84957620	3723	3240	3764.692	3199.8126	0.9328863	0.9073667	0.0400	-0.0160164644869	1.0281249!sample_table_end
