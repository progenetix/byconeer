Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481780/suppl/GSM481780_JBH556.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	717	1051	826.8444	917.212	1.2665893	1.2444722	-0.0254	0.0951143935703	0.98253812	342	667	385.4088	591.3532	0.7819896	0.9656881	0.3044	0.0675701596997	1.23491173	699	1047	807.3013	913.8727	0.7779662	0.8636225	0.1507	0.00282304293116	1.11010294	4914	4358	5226.174	3845.4038	4.5513361	3.4069539	-0.4178	0.062620074194	0.74856135	9759	12651	9894.4375	11747.123	8.9712967	11.100206	0.3072	-0.0433128343032	1.23730236	2852	3744	3121.5096	3281.6066	3.3501455	3.4078228	0.0246	0.05232059244	1.01721637	1388	1469	1572.0204	1273.5703	1.1684428	1.0297005	-0.1824	-0.103623265553	0.88125888	1340	1320	1518.3932	1146.016	0.9962257	0.8346668	-0.2553	-0.0974636744812	0.83782919	838	1335	961.2854	1159.2385	1.8001413	1.7510061	-0.0399	-0.0014235456514	0.972704810	4787	6322	5097.3503	5637.272	3.0668971	3.7410303	0.2867	0.0161660953515	1.219809511	8532	8108	8745.6281	7315.1107	5.7388451	5.4716986	-0.0688	-0.0746773033623	0.953449412	3438	3265	3726.8551	2852.5113	2.4045129	2.0544443	-0.2270	0.0456506927086	0.854411813	2353	3270	2599.0387	2856.9966	1.3838995	1.6673937	0.2689	-0.0894889776361	1.204851814	1440	2663	1629.9787	2319.2367	3.7266096	4.0723948	0.1280	0.0984791185768	1.092788115	1498	1958	1694.0823	1698.7773	0.9432763	1.1235498	0.2523	0.0343256039391	1.191114316	1140	1753	1298.4236	1523.5389	0.8413238	1.0609304	0.3346	-0.044052208241	1.261025117	295	392	325.9903	364.8442	0.6534687	0.6084658	-0.1029	-0.328670118963	0.931132318	1360	2011	1540.7212	1744.9761	1.6959504	1.7704494	0.0620	-0.0263855213521	1.043927619	381	679	433.4064	601.3514	0.7835867	0.9175775	0.2277	0.0197066107541	1.170996920	1195	1389	1358.9725	1205.5432	0.9295963	0.8073413	-0.2034	0.0347721163721	0.8684859!sample_table_end
