Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481679/suppl/GSM481679_JA945.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	736	660	744.0887	653.5575	0.7694597	0.6810184	0.1762	-0.0665044686737	1.12986622	979	843	982.8192	838.8231	1.2559875	1.0426152	0.2686	0.11094862222	1.2046513	1199	989	1195.9346	985.6868	0.9827944	0.8330201	0.2385	0.0599835853851	1.17979674	5631	4800	5371.848	4941.1386	4.2695889	4.051945	0.0755	-0.0167743500374	1.05371345	7274	7129	6887.4535	7400.859	5.4534312	6.0989729	-0.1614	0.0506377936759	0.89415566	3910	3278	3770.297	3349.1784	3.328987	3.0972123	0.1041	0.0240103957814	1.07483337	1918	2021	1889.1628	2037.5366	1.4347598	1.4827696	-0.0475	0.071015733728	0.96762158	1784	1657	1760.273	1663.1325	1.242997	1.2209734	0.0258	0.0107178337531	1.01803789	740	975	748.0443	971.5594	0.9283125	1.1701465	-0.3340	-0.182704527294	0.793330110	3003	2918	2915.4567	2975.4394	1.969379	2.0440555	-0.0537	0.0155372472452	0.963466511	4482	3868	4303.5359	3965.4123	2.9968163	2.9716232	0.0122	-0.223758345372	1.008477812	3151	2681	3055.3418	2727.494	2.3036017	2.0761069	0.1500	0.213211887589	1.109577513	1006	1035	1009.0199	1032.3547	0.8417626	0.8653348	-0.0398	0.0630467300461	0.972759514	2049	2346	2012.9979	2375.7533	3.0368659	3.4444403	-0.1817	0.0718506559149	0.881671815	2062	1664	2025.2069	1670.384	1.3164638	1.1502788	0.1947	0.132279653074	1.144473616	857	945	863.7508	941.3498	0.6082052	0.650258	-0.0965	0.0247535573219	0.935328917	383	433	403.5798	421.6671	0.4855481	0.4984268	-0.0378	-0.136168582494	0.974161418	1392	1393	1383.8121	1393.358	1.3622187	1.384984	-0.0239	-0.224562476127	0.983562719	561	587	571.7961	578.8834	0.6805114	0.6659715	0.0312	0.0316474341102	1.021832520	727	600	735.1919	592.3999	0.5079247	0.4237825	0.2613	0.135060941794	1.1985503!sample_table_end
