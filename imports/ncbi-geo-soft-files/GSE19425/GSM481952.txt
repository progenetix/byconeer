Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481952/suppl/GSM481952_MR378.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	8569	3676	7477.8003	4519.0566	1.5425005	0.9434266	-0.7093	0.0856684388788	0.61162162	8369	7824	7285.9942	8378.5576	1.534849	1.8751471	0.2889	0.0499748826292	1.22171443	4775	3660	3877.1903	4502.3401	0.8272792	0.9416775	0.1869	0.142477483616	1.13828244	18822	18271	17184.225	17410.615	3.7765907	3.8193756	0.0163	-0.0126976618143	1.01132895	21443	22015	19562.366	20683.032	4.68918	4.6215954	-0.0209	-0.0792775608928	0.98558716	12259	11654	11032.633	11702.497	2.4994241	2.5968687	0.0552	0.109249552873	1.03898687	3729	4354	2968.5619	5208.4658	0.6443561	1.1212961	0.7992	0.350702264941	1.74018078	5061	2774	4143.9307	3539.2056	0.9779321	0.8213188	-0.2518	-0.0174019399039	0.83985259	6105	4030	5122.7793	4885.2402	0.9854056	1.0009473	0.0226	-0.199092349141	1.015771810	13803	11875	12535.254	11890.673	3.5237376	3.2188584	-0.1306	-0.109142243523	0.913478411	19691	15721	17988.35	15187.387	4.8776641	4.0505774	-0.2681	-0.21541372089	0.830433812	13741	15888	12476.527	15329.672	2.7268834	3.3990497	0.3179	-0.138209132312	1.246496113	6558	3877	5539.0504	4727.9071	1.3662231	1.1212315	-0.2851	-0.157381905165	0.820679614	18204	20418	16622.421	19292.095	3.5168286	4.0695503	0.2106	-0.175951356345	1.157164815	6442	4014	5432.418	4869.1515	1.1617933	1.0157414	-0.1938	-0.0805562074363	0.874287516	4985	3765	4072.8431	4611.8493	0.8479433	0.9823507	0.2123	-0.104756685511	1.158509817	1688	1012	1308.0814	1400.6736	0.2891006	0.3178985	0.1370	0.228117655102	1.09961218	9348	7114	8228.7111	7765.9738	1.7175999	1.5462517	-0.1516	-0.0642922280343	0.900239719	4303	2020	3453.6906	2665.9905	0.7902309	0.6176554	-0.3555	-0.108004954462	0.781613820	3538	2085	2796.9999	2743.5982	0.7351667	0.7312857	-0.0076	-0.211253442762	0.9947209!sample_table_end
