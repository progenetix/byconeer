Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481857/suppl/GSM481857_MR253.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4116	4863	4193.3419	4770.5448	1.1675801	1.3186799	-0.1756	-0.216912622247	0.88541592	4614	4284	4682.394	4199.9936	1.3840007	1.2165487	0.1861	0.264133561088	1.13764513	4578	4743	4647.6836	4650.397	1.2163705	1.2229091	-0.0077	-0.195371625887	0.99465334	11605	8870	11528.639	8727.523	3.2411285	2.5094563	0.3691	0.206786736248	1.2915665	14024	12735	13912.574	12472.958	3.6780077	3.3166474	0.1492	0.112478224183	1.10895356	8816	8714	8795.093	8570.8469	2.466666	2.417067	0.0293	0.0499449204381	1.02052037	2843	2909	2914.0571	2845.7429	0.7490014	0.7390694	0.0193	0.0681695805266	1.01343858	2964	2998	3038.0683	2932.1478	0.8514737	0.8575848	-0.0103	0.0444089484385	0.99287419	6014	8286	6055.7245	8144.0046	1.707253	2.2316566	-0.3864	-0.273078998698	0.76501610	11447	11240	11371.302	11033.348	3.6065574	3.6433132	-0.0146	0.0352521391408	0.989911411	10736	11468	10665.38	11256.07	3.2755966	3.6352837	-0.1503	-0.126198012586	0.901056712	8138	8421	8132.8903	8278.394	2.2285452	2.2982902	-0.0445	0.00745918186261	0.969653513	5243	6530	5300.8556	6411.088	1.6654391	2.043766	-0.2953	-0.203198140222	0.814887414	9461	10176	9423.9496	10009.953	2.8452863	2.8305506	0.0075	0.0296882211287	1.005205915	4053	4701	4131.3707	4608.3584	1.0970881	1.2874076	-0.2308	-0.199038044049	0.852168416	4295	5134	4369.302	5041.3431	1.1333849	1.3232551	-0.2235	-0.132619630916	0.856512817	2056	2614	2114.8673	2558.6662	0.6208718	0.7415334	-0.2562	-0.288335662621	0.83728118	5500	6487	5553.4532	6368.7538	1.461736	1.6131115	-0.1422	-0.208365555032	0.906159319	3403	3936	3480.4695	3849.517	1.0398889	1.1509519	-0.1464	-0.195480127635	0.903503420	3045	3304	3120.1941	3234.7873	0.9016413	0.995623	-0.1430	-0.187842229254	0.9056052!sample_table_end
