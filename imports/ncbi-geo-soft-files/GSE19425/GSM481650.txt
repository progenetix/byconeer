Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481650/suppl/GSM481650_JA804.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1064	2768	1614.3186	1918.7673	1.0622339	0.9062317	-0.2291	-0.229128069042	0.85313762	528	2794	900.2933	1936.2735	1.0114516	1.2080395	0.2562	0.109929233592	1.1943623	2069	3969	2682.0308	2784.4897	1.0446164	1.1530203	0.1424	-0.0689752948546	1.10377394	10451	10812	10545.79	8182.6891	2.7635751	2.9216457	0.0802	0.148998381908	1.05719795	10139	12703	10263.92	9805.4054	4.6867279	4.3987693	-0.0915	-0.0138317127802	0.93855876	4050	9768	4623.7618	7319.0533	2.1781706	3.3821638	0.6348	0.408502967574	1.55275437	1276	1895	1852.5339	1344.4658	1.1390181	1.0109888	-0.1720	0.104392890274	0.88759678	4267	3980	4838.9877	2792.5116	0.898256	0.8023358	-0.1629	0.112788192834	0.8932159	577	2808	983.4971	1945.7892	1.1411015	1.1833861	0.0525	-0.0862038683704	1.037055910	12845	14506	12684.43	11382.423	2.205731	3.0171852	0.4519	0.00338016687677	1.367884411	43265	22813	37348.482	19126.415	6.3768513	5.243341	-0.2824	-0.283521027308	0.82224612	5602	7054	6126.2135	5119.7512	1.9832554	2.5214103	0.3464	0.108645955856	1.271349213	3771	5826	4348.2974	4151.2998	1.5077935	1.6601616	0.1389	-0.11779941627	1.101053614	1036	5355	1581.2939	3791.43	2.2452685	2.7471108	0.2910	-0.127291435263	1.22351115	5201	6935	5749.0109	5024.8122	1.3101926	1.651089	0.3336	-0.0681738225901	1.260187916	1894	2848	2488.8185	1972.9676	0.9722486	1.1019282	0.1806	-0.195466250586	1.133381117	549	1417	937.0192	1027.9613	0.9258127	0.5939559	-0.6404	-0.337416777936	0.641550818	859	3324	1372.9843	2318.0791	1.3974265	1.6073308	0.2019	-0.129980108475	1.150207719	527	2401	898.4882	1673.2873	0.8867444	0.9647062	0.1216	-0.257015779385	1.087919120	1764	1890	2344.2757	1341.0455	0.7008351	0.4355683	-0.6862	-0.281120685834	0.6214989!sample_table_end
