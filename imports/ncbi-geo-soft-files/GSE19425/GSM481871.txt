Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481871/suppl/GSM481871_MR281.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4636	4259	4453.8134	4397.4479	1.2131707	1.1685407	0.0541	0.0693532383002	1.03819292	5914	4601	5677.1148	4748.0731	1.9079005	1.4867582	0.3598	0.182470601175	1.2832623	3641	3047	3506.1585	3164.0329	0.8912863	0.8160948	0.1272	-0.11026769117	1.09213574	17120	11954	16109.912	12400.242	3.9752923	3.2326116	0.2984	0.171480990299	1.22974635	19918	16323	18698.557	16917.325	5.2492569	4.7812076	0.1347	0.106108944948	1.09789356	12094	10684	11436.534	11072.539	3.2298437	3.1719963	0.0261	0.0895367939387	1.01823697	3539	3172	3407.4661	3293.3196	0.8951492	0.9068217	-0.0187	0.0527601799939	0.9871288	3861	3488	3718.4056	3617.6663	0.9760051	1.0140458	-0.0552	0.0427631097421	0.96248629	4149	4250	3989.8262	4388.2481	1.2504726	1.266861	-0.0188	0.0717099571196	0.987063710	17367	12838	16338.189	13316.503	5.2470474	4.5935113	0.1919	0.221422274393	1.142273711	12514	10644	11832.382	11030.981	3.4078379	3.4433588	-0.0150	0.0609564448409	0.989684212	12282	10286	11612.712	10658.893	3.261096	3.1548766	0.0478	0.0790963889796	1.033668313	3374	3068	3245.6181	3185.7544	1.274692	1.2847036	-0.0113	0.116127437796	0.99220714	9144	9723	8703.8091	10071.447	3.4368741	3.5983552	-0.0662	0.00941253281927	0.955123615	2820	2269	2708.2695	2374.4871	0.7398393	0.6836195	0.1140	0.0668963914865	1.082238516	3792	3456	3651.8933	3585.6062	0.9202647	0.9608061	-0.0622	0.0255981036008	0.957804717	1003	951	952.6315	1023.2274	0.3074741	0.3147989	-0.0340	0.0102047940815	0.976731818	5460	5523	5241.3376	5708.3206	1.7443507	1.7908029	-0.0379	0.0744957087574	0.974060619	2165	2054	2076.5755	2150.6283	0.6835481	0.6660715	0.0374	0.0275140432386	1.026238320	3217	2499	3091.3337	2604.6986	1.0385519	0.9142472	0.1839	0.023926821132	1.1359639!sample_table_end
