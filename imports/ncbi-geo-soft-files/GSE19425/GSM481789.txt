Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481789/suppl/GSM481789_MR027.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2685	2485	2514.5658	2641.6827	1.0037023	1.0509497	-0.0664	-0.0996324146493	0.95504312	1879	1521	1795.1881	1610.6425	0.7298297	0.6395397	0.1905	0.086488948051	1.14117963	3201	2904	2978.5269	3094.2212	1.1649513	1.2562829	-0.1089	-0.159043701479	0.92730014	9040	10385	8260.1217	10783.035	3.3884804	4.5511308	-0.4256	-0.364140020773	0.74453595	14389	17685	13225.871	18104.157	5.4938516	8.0126418	-0.5445	-0.565906246932	0.68564796	10376	5109	9480.6772	5427.7314	3.9513149	2.3473934	0.7513	0.634612318399	1.68327767	3529	2494	3273.3861	2651.6198	1.2198198	0.9119492	0.4196	0.434145990027	1.33759618	2454	2735	2308.0477	2916.7596	0.9209621	1.2084914	-0.3920	-0.157455517974	0.76207589	3126	2918	2911.1864	3108.7292	1.081106	1.1256163	-0.0582	-0.122737058434	0.960456910	10953	8361	10018.089	8721.1164	4.0107702	3.5943323	0.1582	0.131380604366	1.115859611	11785	9709	10785.853	10094.563	4.4033218	4.2391842	0.0548	-0.0203633472259	1.038719112	4944	7140	4534.4599	7491.105	1.7258683	2.6044271	-0.5936	-0.32611353961	0.662667113	3760	3762	3483.8634	4020.4248	1.3102925	1.3572407	-0.0508	-0.033043761	0.96540914	8989	10179	8213.266	10574.271	3.0989306	3.9870523	-0.3636	-0.206458013277	0.777248515	3150	2650	2932.7421	2824.9425	1.0052085	1.0094252	-0.0060	-0.0163223490752	0.995822616	2351	2931	2216.6483	3122.1973	0.8085963	1.0523365	-0.3801	-0.198758518616	0.768381817	1137	947	1105.5415	1009.2388	0.4422379	0.4025104	0.1358	0.0764096873969	1.098699218	5014	3780	4595.8238	4039.9419	1.7664618	1.6286288	0.1172	0.249708794711	1.084631319	2323	1938	2191.7619	2054.1518	0.864886	0.8045116	0.1044	0.0928013110211	1.075044820	1067	1129	1037.7928	1198.5956	0.4025748	0.4627311	-0.2009	-0.163676730281	0.8699971!sample_table_end
