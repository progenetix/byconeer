Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481752/suppl/GSM481752_JBH522.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2432	2051	2328.0919	2129.9842	1.043877	0.981429	-0.0890	0.0043260649209	0.94017692	2287	2255	2186.9513	2332.3664	1.1165061	1.139243	0.0291	-0.0177863893936	1.02036433	1755	1685	1679.2478	1761.6845	0.7315096	0.7940635	0.1184	0.197785141569	1.08551344	10395	6383	9841.6425	6335.901	4.303703	3.0182057	-0.5119	-0.0798456168549	0.70130435	14681	11756	13796.869	11499.979	6.6991687	5.6538742	-0.2447	-0.284805071674	0.84396656	7036	5953	6694.7964	5918.3724	3.1549558	2.8710391	-0.1360	-0.0687633209503	0.91000937	1662	1363	1590.9499	1436.0861	1.0994915	0.9573011	-0.1998	-0.19030303747	0.87067628	2212	1608	2115.6308	1684.0622	0.9418288	0.8203172	-0.1993	-0.204905824071	0.87098339	3576	3147	3428.6019	3207.3833	1.6391921	1.4507148	-0.1762	-0.227744581318	0.885018110	8887	7374	8433.8491	7291.9028	4.0134365	3.7422912	-0.1009	-0.232531149808	0.932440611	10435	8647	9878.8708	8519.3926	4.3760038	4.2637847	-0.0375	-0.0697238385033	0.974355812	4352	3164	4163.3247	3223.7989	2.6454708	2.174463	-0.2829	-0.0640288932942	0.821956913	1665	1456	1593.8444	1528.0876	1.1244077	1.1140254	-0.0134	-0.124882297775	0.990766314	6897	6076	6565.132	6037.9458	3.7345776	2.9820293	-0.3247	-0.241327117269	0.798491715	1464	1338	1398.2079	1411.565	0.7743867	0.8384196	0.1146	0.00503184692824	1.082688616	1284	1343	1227.7118	1416.4715	0.7661423	0.9176824	0.2604	-0.0180401456683	1.197796317	742	768	710.2907	836.0247	0.3645637	0.4147158	0.1860	0.107231892242	1.137567418	3272	3239	3140.8477	3296.1758	1.6319841	1.5469139	-0.0772	-0.18153802131	0.947873119	1205	1282	1151.8023	1356.9659	0.6238218	0.7041052	0.1747	0.0685182449059	1.128696120	2191	1483	2096.1931	1555.413	0.9636472	0.7418798	-0.3773	-0.124873551133	0.7698666!sample_table_end
