Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481489/suppl/GSM481489_DE398.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1968	1300	1656.8887	1510.4873	1.4042444	1.2170813	0.2064	0.160350869439	1.15378032	1143	635	940.1315	785.4591	1.0748305	0.8069444	0.4136	0.398772389956	1.33197583	1982	1113	1668.9978	1301.2748	1.4552109	1.1913114	0.2887	0.189196434798	1.22152014	3317	1665	2787.6303	1918.4434	2.4790893	1.7607715	0.4936	0.1818255304	1.40795635	4388	3245	3672.1595	3709.4058	3.8279215	3.6077041	0.0855	0.0507015887167	1.06104096	4018	3274	3369.7951	3742.6692	3.1489429	3.6632562	-0.2183	-0.302933381054	0.85960217	862	633	695.5481	783.3178	1.0123396	1.1360201	-0.1663	-0.164103616057	0.89112838	1060	751	868.4933	908.9362	0.7994586	0.8557812	-0.0982	-0.0449679653353	0.93418589	1247	913	1030.9542	1082.638	1.0131122	1.0936682	-0.1104	0.0905626947208	0.926343310	4813	4101	4023.2515	4691.7853	4.4195567	5.1204566	-0.2124	-0.0797049616951	0.863117711	4886	4196	4083.4335	4801.0832	4.421327	5.1234468	-0.2126	0.0716636951036	0.862959512	1749	885	1465.8796	1052.7261	1.8640256	1.3788211	0.4350	0.264940509166	1.351898113	1618	1201	1352.9252	1399.149	2.1100553	1.9614982	0.1053	0.193860036785	1.075736614	1997	1715	1681.9748	1974.0941	2.0588828	2.1201519	-0.0423	-0.0235521441322	0.971101515	1221	707	1007.7846	862.1851	1.1647913	1.0167238	0.1961	0.210713278486	1.14563216	1549	810	1293.6841	972.7489	1.6064395	1.2676495	0.3417	0.185741738865	1.267258417	834	582	669.8283	728.9264	0.7050989	0.6908203	0.0295	0.0646588440662	1.02066918	2332	1756	1964.1328	2019.7591	1.5382826	2.0337793	-0.4028	-0.242744472681	0.756366519	1475	1142	1230.2159	1333.1662	1.2538477	1.2535592	0.0003	0.0679272270335	1.000230220	1020	610	832.5287	758.6509	0.8540303	0.7473955	0.1924	0.0522198579483	1.1426752!sample_table_end
