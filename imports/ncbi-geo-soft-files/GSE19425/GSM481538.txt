Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481538/suppl/GSM481538_EL158.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4071	3833	4328.021	3552.048	1.1335471	0.9048677	-0.3251	-0.0951207916796	0.7982622	3664	3830	3911.8277	3549.1935	0.9385718	0.82938	-0.1784	-0.18732819347	0.88366173	4502	4358	4761.7859	4056.4269	1.2482049	1.0539587	-0.2440	0.025951115492	0.84437964	11397	9728	11404.295	9328.9498	3.2288551	2.6617816	-0.2786	-0.497796430298	0.82437325	13619	13761	13491.758	13426.912	3.7538589	3.6922866	-0.0239	-0.222182526882	0.98359766	7978	7100	8197.9359	6733.9912	2.3494651	1.9108116	-0.2981	-0.259139066323	0.81329647	1983	2458	2211.6945	2249.996	0.6034789	0.6350638	0.0736	-0.182782030961	1.0523388	2598	2764	2829.6057	2538.4846	0.7709912	0.6851673	-0.1703	-0.26762405587	0.88868379	9355	9028	9501.6948	8629.983	2.1166489	1.9170199	-0.1429	-0.155518218741	0.905686210	14682	14444	14476.711	14129.428	4.0863842	3.9654643	-0.0433	-0.00859858662978	0.97040911	19624	9989	18926.08	9592.899	5.2838702	2.6998207	-0.9687	-1.00196522094	0.510955112	5111	4836	5367.1421	4514.6715	1.4137041	1.2517257	-0.1756	0.1084817691	0.885422713	4763	5144	5022.6419	4816.3682	1.3230597	1.3282742	0.0057	-0.00809338376765	1.003941114	9957	8267	10067.193	7885.7729	2.5622852	1.9807431	-0.3714	-0.128168145374	0.773037715	3963	4164	4216.3314	3868.6841	1.1106327	1.0378803	-0.0977	0.0180331871452	0.934494716	4173	5237	4430.9698	4908.4313	1.1242962	1.3068411	0.2171	0.019337120865	1.162363617	2377	2549	2604.2192	2336.6065	0.6507132	0.568491	-0.1949	-0.0413792812104	0.873642918	4508	4733	4767.8022	4415.6865	1.3291843	1.1584053	-0.1984	0.00261482201582	0.871515919	4506	4754	4765.7975	4435.8616	1.1861521	1.0785552	-0.1372	0.0661660862074	0.909289120	3449	3354	3697.2036	3100.2143	0.9596334	0.7784582	-0.3019	0.0960521139504	0.8112037!sample_table_end
