Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481772/suppl/GSM481772_JBH546.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1618	1852	1719.4381	1732.319	1.1719816	1.1606758	-0.0140	0.0344002670591	0.99035322	1230	1559	1320.1997	1457.4392	1.3286275	1.3551614	0.0285	0.0306683014365	1.01997093	1013	1183	1096.4104	1103.2028	0.6107528	0.6554791	0.1020	0.0943031012384	1.07323154	5990	4487	6124.5604	4239.4551	3.2915906	2.4374447	-0.4334	-0.070717541556	0.74050675	11901	9674	11915.295	9173.9794	7.063437	5.9561038	-0.2460	-0.109442581077	0.84323026	5152	5440	5284.2548	5140.059	3.2518434	3.3718113	0.0523	0.0775377982429	1.03689237	1964	1948	2077.7433	1820.3984	1.143139	1.1024474	-0.0523	0.0550416567259	0.96440368	1624	1726	1725.5152	1615.2379	0.9023174	0.8931704	-0.0147	0.0583785665127	0.98986289	1832	2247	1940.8918	2105.7786	1.962501	1.9489165	-0.0100	-0.0590830401751	0.993077910	6550	8187	6684.7481	7747.266	3.6720599	4.1212591	0.1665	0.0418863732683	1.122328911	8068	8886	8188.1378	8419.7211	4.3258614	4.6123875	0.0925	0.0591569972642	1.066235612	3432	2871	3554.5861	2701.7918	1.8235717	1.5004125	-0.2814	-0.028343620903	0.822787813	2667	3278	2785.3277	3084.9281	1.3473398	1.4514072	0.1073	-0.0269288471746	1.077239214	3182	3406	3304.0376	3206.3374	4.1163141	3.3168605	-0.3115	-0.10710342575	0.805784115	1734	2138	1838.553	2000.4408	0.9013622	1.0293121	0.1915	0.0976436950915	1.141951616	1305	1900	1396.9171	1776.1163	0.6676138	0.9425103	0.4975	0.0949338005994	1.411759717	434	600	486.3981	556.8687	0.4604835	0.4885805	0.0854	-0.128993325817	1.061016318	1555	2459	1654.9313	2310.4185	1.3920601	1.6972017	0.2859	0.121387866686	1.219201519	564	854	626.7761	792.9406	0.6104784	0.7038039	0.2052	0.0928874827929	1.152872720	1442	1616	1537.3813	1511.3136	0.8679803	0.7867612	-0.1417	0.109935115718	0.9064274!sample_table_end
