Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481731/suppl/GSM481731_JBH403.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2341	2049	2060.3634	2304.7341	0.9874959	1.1024737	-0.1589	-0.0503548698338	0.89570922	2387	2013	2101.6206	2264.8258	1.2927967	1.2999143	-0.0079	-0.245841903623	0.99452463	3799	2672	3367.6587	2963.8633	1.1653298	1.0401219	0.1640	0.0242077489551	1.12037814	18448	11489	15715.265	12578.868	5.5716568	4.5430697	0.2944	0.0421376243593	1.22640795	22546	17551	19004.431	19212.741	6.6771892	7.2050699	-0.1098	-0.104090240415	0.92673486	12486	8500	10823.484	9316.547	3.9443373	3.5543712	0.1502	0.187038742236	1.10971457	1759	1546	1539.3193	1766.4354	1.1443044	0.9609304	0.2520	0.307619123219	1.19082978	3496	2267	3101.7403	2537.6253	0.9878629	0.8753747	0.1744	0.122290113736	1.12850289	2330	2150	2050.4996	2414.34	1.189344	1.3142938	-0.1441	0.0460754091597	0.9049310	8196	6765	7190.4525	7425.4829	2.8701852	2.7934797	0.0391	-0.13390815158	1.027458711	16941	12804	14482.745	14015.542	4.6747667	4.9184424	-0.0733	0.0160960466491	0.950456712	9290	5945	8114.0957	6531.8206	3.8736729	3.1961966	0.2773	0.334923013757	1.211963213	2883	2781	2546.7897	3082.4755	1.5268616	1.5310897	-0.0040	0.192383692025	0.997238514	7749	7800	6811.2644	8556.114	4.781047	5.0954518	-0.0919	-0.0391363626659	0.938296915	2668	1711	2354.9574	1940.8631	0.9018119	0.8090528	0.1566	0.193304959987	1.114651416	2103	1683	1848.2193	1911.3934	0.9460496	0.9092559	0.0572	0.150673008167	1.040465617	1169	741	995.3793	905.5247	0.6054143	0.5131135	0.2386	0.11217646451	1.179883718	3806	3853	3373.7503	4234.17	1.41818	1.558309	-0.1359	-0.106921618375	0.910076219	1468	1320	1275.8296	1523.504	0.7556728	0.8740039	-0.2099	-0.120576214065	0.864610420	2794	1755	2467.3847	1987.2854	0.7386617	0.6970306	0.0837	0.135571117265	1.0597262!sample_table_end
