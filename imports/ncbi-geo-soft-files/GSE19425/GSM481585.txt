Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481585/suppl/GSM481585_EL647.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3359	3207	3421.9707	3130.065	0.8009674	0.7447529	0.1050	-0.154359077639	1.07548062	3268	4256	3328.9576	4117.164	0.9389387	1.1434079	-0.2842	-0.318762510423	0.82117563	2205	2015	2236.1972	2006.2843	0.5924544	0.5357276	0.1452	-0.0872514297829	1.10588754	14567	19492	14608.59	18620.455	3.6511143	5.2285538	-0.5181	-0.519566170055	0.69830295	10243	25317	10414.701	24271.504	3.0855502	7.0635097	-1.1949	-0.556030959345	0.43682966	10363	11449	10531.7	10844.117	3.1945162	3.2614485	-0.0299	-0.153553797799	0.97947777	1534	2741	1548.0552	2687.9663	0.6571001	1.0233212	-0.6391	-0.225287769595	0.64212498	2515	3184	2558.0502	3108.9427	0.7960921	0.978365	-0.2974	-0.365102259781	0.81369649	3090	3640	3150.6247	3535.2351	0.8588081	0.9415404	-0.1327	-0.203634474589	0.912130810	10858	12074	11014.74	11442.174	4.8180372	5.028273	-0.0616	-0.198157027122	0.958189211	5856	6884	6002.2299	6569.1403	2.3978343	2.6465724	-0.1424	-0.375193398793	0.90601512	5749	7338	5892.3648	6999.5989	2.6996278	3.0712589	-0.1861	-0.379041436307	0.878997113	1669	1631	1687.7803	1638.5133	0.959764	0.8489197	0.1771	-0.0128176831101	1.130570914	5453	7035	5588.4437	6711.5963	1.7626559	2.008132	-0.1881	-0.275955097476	0.87775915	1723	1700	1743.9322	1703.093	0.7574692	0.7233886	0.0664	-0.0448933403355	1.047112416	1728	2337	1749.1339	2310.272	0.6769853	0.8589751	-0.3435	-0.147522123804	0.788131417	912	660	906.0374	710.5993	0.2439455	0.1910301	0.3528	-0.00191096047403	1.277000318	6177	6980	6328.7811	6659.3154	1.5982388	1.6082601	-0.0090	-0.0855204793875	0.993768819	2462	2497	2503.5469	2460.7849	0.6746415	0.6641221	0.0227	-0.0994277433892	1.015839520	2055	1962	2082.8201	1954.6235	1.0039517	0.9775061	0.0385	-0.274438494749	1.0270541!sample_table_end
