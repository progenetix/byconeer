Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481844/suppl/GSM481844_MR226.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6524	6219	6160.0407	6513.582	1.2578371	1.3387087	0.0899	0.0225473530225	1.06429422	6253	6693	5898.7407	6997.5099	1.3571277	1.580368	0.2197	-0.000634853345346	1.16449463	9732	7313	9137.8562	7626.2903	1.993625	1.687948	-0.2401	0.19401062761	0.84667284	16517	13333	15403.884	13827.587	3.521962	3.1704393	-0.1517	-0.00346004968022	0.90019125	23067	21157	21532.213	21697.782	5.4391243	5.4417173	0.0007	-0.057852303925	1.00047676	13825	11991	12908.792	12452.278	3.0216579	2.8998619	-0.0594	-0.0608391971221	0.95969237	1866	1795	1743.2147	1949.5207	0.7595969	0.7955783	0.0668	0.129885031012	1.0473698	3801	3653	3599.1525	3854.7263	0.831686	0.9013801	0.1161	-0.0288903783266	1.08379869	6279	6504	5923.5956	6805.7388	1.3661371	1.5486964	0.1810	0.207747075869	1.133631710	11285	11255	10572.183	11693.315	2.4369834	2.8156817	0.2084	0.164580991586	1.155396311	20516	17987	19150.563	18523.89	4.4147554	4.524784	0.0355	0.0562593017141	1.024922912	9704	7455	9112.4104	7773.5689	3.1696165	2.6192277	-0.2752	-0.0150020356582	0.826354813	6782	7291	6406.1252	7603.6395	2.0151377	2.3600016	0.2279	0.256197650865	1.171136614	15943	15654	14868.29	16172.44	3.4172522	3.6127272	0.0803	0.00803991270817	1.057202415	3768	4179	3567.1748	4397.2005	0.9896339	1.2104245	0.2905	0.222746703734	1.223103316	2861	2896	2705.6827	3080.7885	1.02112	1.0948206	0.1005	0.0606278046143	1.072176317	3087	2757	2922.8843	2940.6118	0.6492691	0.640349	-0.0200	0.415648892071	0.986261318	7088	5876	6690.7944	6159.2359	1.4206806	1.3092607	-0.1178	-0.0540947697754	0.921572919	5482	5187	5186.8143	5442.6389	1.2034944	1.2651604	0.0721	0.252117690907	1.051239120	5068	4158	4801.8341	4375.682	0.8416356	0.8250781	-0.0287	0.145028504035	0.9803269!sample_table_end
