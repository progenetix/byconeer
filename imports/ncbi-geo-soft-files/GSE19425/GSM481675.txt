Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481675/suppl/GSM481675_JA927.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5113	4509	4948.7736	4433.6074	1.7508034	1.5538784	0.1721	-0.0432043267344	1.12673132	2727	2809	2633.2088	2817.3863	0.8753409	0.9198005	-0.0715	-0.0896152076689	0.95166393	2649	2478	2554.9088	2505.4732	1.1715209	1.0924344	0.1008	-0.0470872798751	1.07239474	3497	3543	3375.2757	3516.8983	1.5424804	1.6686196	-0.1134	-0.406730512602	0.92440515	6325	7879	6134.9366	7579.1476	3.7100792	4.0599686	-0.1300	-0.366522047547	0.91381976	7185	6762	6960.803	6535.285	3.1290801	2.7938939	0.1635	0.0460770859758	1.1199717	1109	788	1061.5814	863.7521	1.0735836	0.8068025	0.4121	0.162139382495	1.33066468	1463	1430	1411.3994	1492.4525	0.6991825	0.7869221	-0.1706	-0.188515948281	0.88850299	5651	5512	5474.388	5368.1556	1.6898955	1.6683568	0.0185	0.0296766319385	1.012910110	3428	3022	3309.7016	3019.8439	1.9823048	2.1755772	-0.1342	0.042249573246	0.911162711	10010	9646	9720.4833	9243.8952	5.7408092	6.0660433	-0.0795	-0.130556705547	0.946384512	1235	1369	1186.5271	1432.8391	1.0307911	1.2841928	-0.3171	-0.31292280589	0.802676313	1973	1887	1904.6971	1936.6207	1.8205573	2.1339091	-0.2291	-0.0242353591929	0.85315614	6723	9095	6520.2197	8722.597	2.5908789	2.7892071	-0.1064	-0.228595022477	0.928894415	2191	2005	2110.2567	2051.8357	1.5229146	1.552211	-0.0275	0.0588894417531	0.98112616	1096	1216	1048.5399	1282.4377	0.8866316	1.1107518	-0.3251	-0.0781835912104	0.798226617	2653	2531	2558.831	2554.8149	0.8389535	0.8368844	0.0036	0.0424130674637	1.002472418	2885	3994	2791.6595	3951.633	1.3876742	1.4961025	-0.1085	-0.0234578844174	0.927526219	3883	4245	3752.4332	4187.8747	1.2608652	1.4198181	-0.1713	-0.057946344881	0.888047120	1063	729	1015.1658	805.352	0.4931513	0.4641158	0.0875	-0.0845005763472	1.0625608!sample_table_end
