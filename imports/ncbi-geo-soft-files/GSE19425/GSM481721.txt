Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481721/suppl/GSM481721_JBH219.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3924	4123	4457.4168	3600.2098	0.881877	0.7153945	0.3018	0.0950471297205	1.23271432	3634	3769	4145.7846	3275.2816	1.0183946	0.7944142	0.3583	0.24096234315	1.2819443	6129	5564	6752.6022	4891.9863	1.3082451	0.9183412	0.5105	0.205704541814	1.4245744	12718	13173	13197.383	12185.963	2.5730626	2.3412154	0.1362	0.154437389814	1.09902855	25560	26170	24864.391	25630.757	5.0856175	5.047593	0.0108	0.112429647941	1.00753316	12996	17945	13461.131	17023.152	2.7566113	3.4363806	-0.3180	-0.319912867831	0.80218457	3932	5777	4466.0971	5088.7775	0.9969784	1.1718804	-0.2332	-0.193771429701	0.8507518	3771	4643	4292.4853	4056.0633	0.8432549	0.8068343	0.0637	0.0887285986703	1.04514019	3445	4408	3947.5688	3853.778	0.943358	0.9071074	0.0565	-0.0832325986905	1.039962810	16447	18605	16653.569	17717.102	3.1981711	3.6151422	-0.1768	-0.202992518946	0.884659811	26092	24333	25331.594	23688.869	4.9084791	4.7591509	0.0446	0.00232504829988	1.03137712	8031	8158	8647.325	7294.2189	1.6854711	1.4379837	0.2291	0.2811180291	1.172107213	8265	8370	8889.5213	7490.6835	1.7167847	1.5299163	0.1663	0.0343639220984	1.122142814	10715	10945	11283.197	10005.305	3.082675	2.546238	0.2758	0.193330826264	1.210678215	6504	6126	7131.9925	5408.747	1.335009	1.0126539	0.3987	0.142322984758	1.31832716	5184	5288	5788.0645	4639.4024	1.1123716	0.9055234	0.2968	0.190860840075	1.228429417	2385	2462	2807.1104	2130.0817	0.6416273	0.4980366	0.3655	0.0764473144288	1.288313518	6796	10278	7426.0848	9336.6754	1.5214129	1.7452339	-0.1980	-0.112335254684	0.87175319	3901	4016	4432.4575	3503.0335	0.9589837	0.7954726	0.2697	0.199527871814	1.205552120	3303	3248	3800.502	2815.584	0.7138953	0.5841764	0.2893	0.0915833984485	1.2220542!sample_table_end
