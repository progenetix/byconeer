Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481806/suppl/GSM481806_MR048.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2494	3449	2534.0244	3295.0412	1.0003495	1.1732177	0.2300	0.448562168689	1.17280792	2778	3772	2842.5843	3581.6384	1.2404345	1.3492972	0.1214	0.140164676406	1.08776183	5103	2786	5243.1174	2714.0068	1.4842628	0.9572626	-0.6328	-0.208669488747	0.64494144	8334	7954	8346.6568	7339.7153	2.4792783	2.4806788	0.0008	0.0475025128818	1.00056495	9663	7835	9572.1818	7230.8593	3.3140319	2.8630651	-0.2110	-0.188662607857	0.8639226	8508	7616	8508.2365	7030.4668	2.8030636	2.6642564	-0.0733	-0.0980704541996	0.95048027	2258	2511	2265.9092	2482.9853	1.0658211	0.9914579	-0.1043	0.088521424891	0.93022928	2749	2697	2810.6289	2636.4452	0.8021483	0.8459885	0.0768	-0.0432831756492	1.05465349	3516	5016	3637.9265	4697.8118	1.5077389	1.6910617	0.1655	0.133477119266	1.121587910	10296	11430	10149.141	10542.14	3.0296435	3.3801272	0.1579	-0.0403137238105	1.115684811	10267	5912	10122.983	5494.0115	2.7504104	1.7196609	-0.6775	-0.621332951375	0.625237912	3922	6531	4059.7745	6049.6867	1.4152495	2.1055508	0.5731	0.310493224316	1.487759413	4228	4072	4379.3015	3852.6682	1.4679143	1.4003421	-0.0680	-0.107192045923	0.953967214	4174	5615	4323.479	5229.0057	2.0954558	2.2378903	0.0949	0.0887193734899	1.06797315	2952	2612	3036.7503	2566.2027	0.8783454	0.8111244	-0.1149	0.108676462828	0.923468616	3049	4013	3139.6168	3800.5419	1.122645	1.3197512	0.2334	0.192001708925	1.175573117	1299	1249	1138.4431	1420.6755	0.4784715	0.5225862	0.1272	0.345967776124	1.092199218	2958	4296	3043.1109	4048.4424	1.3214991	1.643885	0.3149	0.123361072921	1.243954619	2686	3197	2741.3437	3071.8024	1.0783532	1.0964013	0.0239	-0.030546630568	1.016736820	2998	3329	3085.5225	3189.2228	1.008103	1.0253654	0.0245	0.135367278883	1.0171237!sample_table_end
