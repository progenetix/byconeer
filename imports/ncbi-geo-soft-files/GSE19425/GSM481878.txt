Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481878/suppl/GSM481878_MR290.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4761	4353	4623.9117	4446.8869	1.4525573	1.3717362	-0.0826	-0.0374486524797	0.94435942	5208	4294	5033.1717	4388.0808	1.7200526	1.4503869	-0.2460	-0.0346405664006	0.84322243	3402	3071	3326.1269	3133.0993	0.926174	0.8564312	-0.1129	0.0172845591143	0.92469794	18798	15249	17360.989	15923.729	4.9179604	4.5315928	-0.1180	0.0961436254962	0.92143745	27320	21458	24986.977	22338.899	7.134767	6.2941279	-0.1809	-0.0912953195792	0.8821776	13120	12032	12279.044	12516.797	3.7414234	3.7185725	-0.0088	-0.103660112625	0.99389247	3276	3234	3203.3849	3301.8736	1.0419306	1.0143698	-0.0387	0.00169330694069	0.97354838	3554	3477	3474.8347	3548.6689	1.0598695	1.1077583	0.0638	-0.0460538429732	1.04518369	4986	5700	4830.1124	5840.6196	1.50972	1.7856171	0.2421	0.165703982968	1.182747210	13881	11930	12957.968	12406.772	4.6827464	4.7240467	0.0127	0.19106002017	1.008819611	14907	8330	13870.234	8590.2817	4.5140491	3.0033492	-0.5878	-0.547831438465	0.665333712	11821	8640	11104.2	8912.9336	3.4923131	2.7910352	-0.3234	-0.0748209488096	0.799193813	2935	3120	2873.3365	3183.8197	1.1759508	1.3259996	0.1733	0.06271165907	1.127597814	13511	12594	12628.449	13127.903	5.1752235	4.7309712	-0.1295	0.014352293311	0.914157815	2525	2380	2470.9003	2434.1822	0.7352148	0.7380568	0.0056	-0.0668937826343	1.003865416	2892	3441	2831.467	3511.8206	0.8203063	1.0204049	0.3149	0.0883400046881	1.243931617	944	816	888.697	895.0002	0.3124027	0.3077417	-0.0217	-0.0393965415454	0.985080218	6137	6424	5916.6907	6610.0385	1.9232541	1.900064	-0.0175	-0.0303194833077	0.987942219	1768	1633	1722.2156	1697.3603	0.6295728	0.6143535	-0.0353	0.0468408128457	0.975825920	3583	3480	3502.6894	3551.7465	1.1063564	1.2175977	0.1382	0.124280882657	1.1005474!sample_table_end
