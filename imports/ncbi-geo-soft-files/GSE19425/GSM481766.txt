Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481766/suppl/GSM481766_JBH538.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	967	1033	1077.3697	934.6203	0.8459371	0.7606449	-0.1533	0.0358109553327	0.89917432	1248	1338	1381.8517	1205.5289	1.2493441	1.0681941	-0.2260	-0.13906195356	0.85500393	1054	1018	1172.4386	921.5438	0.7150708	0.6251824	-0.1938	-0.0830008391727	0.87429434	8382	6043	8395.0901	5558.3491	5.3530096	3.7922587	-0.4973	-0.160675547668	0.70843485	12648	11346	12280.016	10638.308	7.2060519	6.9328045	-0.0558	-0.140785317839	0.96208086	5108	5567	5291.5166	5111.2918	3.5245076	3.7583377	0.0927	0.153518843514	1.0663447	2019	2269	2199.0469	2045.9571	1.311007	1.2470788	-0.0721	-0.00176688253974	0.95123738	1378	1542	1522.1592	1388.0985	0.9702934	0.891593	-0.1220	-0.0162684797371	0.91889019	1384	1371	1528.6328	1235.4525	1.2977691	1.0231829	-0.3430	-0.127830906739	0.788416710	5606	7442	5773.4992	6890.1602	4.2550728	4.4807065	0.0745	0.0404825979661	1.053026911	4566	5345	4763.7754	4902.3263	3.0797755	3.0335548	-0.0218	-0.100457809103	0.984992112	4677	4017	4872.2265	3662.5485	2.9588443	2.261492	-0.3878	-0.0722189968264	0.764315913	1029	1362	1144.8832	1227.2734	0.7787159	0.7169864	-0.1192	-0.0909112123381	0.920729114	3376	3331	3577.3884	3025.7825	3.6343253	2.9928217	-0.2802	-0.134871832705	0.823487515	1069	1217	1189.0577	1096.9072	0.6864867	0.6139399	-0.1611	-0.0631931589717	0.894321716	1002	1403	1115.5148	1264.537	0.6370506	0.7544313	0.2440	-0.084756612888	1.184256417	241	256	242.2952	261.6204	0.2211729	0.2382953	0.1076	-0.0198277388606	1.077416318	2135	2325	2318.4096	2097.1149	1.5167457	1.3911053	-0.1247	0.0617350067594	0.917164519	406	502	451.6039	475.4854	0.4273898	0.4277155	0.0011	0.0180896070959	1.000762120	1161	1176	1289.0984	1060.1771	0.9711029	0.7439298	-0.3845	-0.0452419558301	0.7660669!sample_table_end
