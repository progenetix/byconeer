Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481657/suppl/GSM481657_JA813.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2420	2937	2431.7761	2849.7691	1.1088934	1.2420813	-0.1636	-0.333107751176	0.89277042	2985	2831	2987.6405	2749.5468	1.3084208	1.0236546	0.3541	0.159945071744	1.27818573	1635	1819	1671.8717	1779.3698	1.0143896	1.1161128	-0.1379	-0.250586747877	0.90885934	6435	4369	6199.7872	4211.6013	3.7425619	2.7367306	0.4516	0.143445796259	1.36753025	7787	6593	7431.455	6364.1637	5.4634026	4.9437832	0.1442	-0.00527649856678	1.10510566	6909	4221	6632.3222	4076.321	4.2211153	2.6348825	0.6799	0.49503065366	1.60201277	1081	694	1116.0026	715.7302	1.0592364	0.8119852	0.3835	0.275322855838	1.30450218	2024	1339	2058.473	1327.1762	1.0221569	0.6961159	0.5542	0.315831443887	1.46837179	3767	4414	3730.9304	4253.1427	1.5286338	1.4767483	0.0498	-0.0382241948686	1.035134910	7314	7988	7001.8489	7729.4142	2.6861087	2.8995507	-0.1103	0.0536941370517	0.926387911	12520	11992	11701.95	11670.354	4.6691999	4.7943264	-0.0382	-0.298859577481	0.973901112	4710	4000	4603.6978	3870.0384	2.2676864	2.1571564	0.0721	-0.037340747912	1.051238713	2986	3855	2988.6037	3731.6883	1.5167527	2.018906	-0.4126	-0.24638954235	0.751274514	6724	7413	6463.5032	7173.6784	3.0374701	2.7291988	0.1544	-0.0302065860363	1.11295315	3589	3742	3562.7109	3619.0225	1.4432863	1.5428229	-0.0962	-0.0334216086611	0.93548416	1278	1544	1316.1462	1523.1685	0.7474198	1.0281392	-0.4600	-0.214696872321	0.726963617	1464	1991	1502.0357	1941.6101	0.6594148	0.7405481	-0.1674	-0.162095919235	0.890441518	2934	3213	2937.6477	3107.748	1.646847	1.6448088	0.0018	0.054513996862	1.001239119	1799	3037	1835.621	2943.8808	0.8405666	1.1345147	-0.4326	-0.194046541116	0.740904120	1172	1453	1206.2125	1436.8087	0.4629013	0.5142367	-0.1517	-0.287634857907	0.9001717!sample_table_end
