Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481589/suppl/GSM481589_EL651.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2508	2366	2542.3004	2331.3535	0.8103039	0.7599904	0.0925	-0.159644120735	1.06620282	3509	3653	3544.9887	3573.7125	1.2874529	1.2709016	0.0187	-0.111578524778	1.01302323	1502	1801	1538.5686	1783.5755	0.5221539	0.5948115	-0.1880	-0.23675112141	0.87784784	15017	15081	14626.517	14825.162	4.5623021	4.7340151	-0.0533	-0.111595873233	0.96372785	11183	20384	11017.828	20237.618	4.0506473	7.2848163	-0.8467	-0.139368696679	0.55603976	12701	11896	12453.822	11634.261	4.6352226	4.4347309	0.0638	-0.0707399814642	1.04520947	1497	2473	1533.5725	2432.6309	0.7987031	1.2109251	-0.6004	-0.163540958853	0.65958098	2196	2135	2228.7456	2105.874	0.8287378	0.823731	0.0087	-0.0882298149578	1.00607839	5166	5030	5191.1988	4905.7779	1.8669222	1.6636646	0.1663	-0.00781885838297	1.122174610	13296	14875	13016.428	14616.491	4.6728301	5.4433828	-0.2202	-0.124215817198	0.858442311	5421	8944	5442.1925	8707.3791	2.1144316	3.4929502	-0.7242	-0.753022268625	0.605342612	4472	5971	4503.113	5817.8103	1.9815106	2.5334923	-0.3545	-0.401252959831	0.782126113	1182	1548	1220.0912	1533.2596	0.5186361	0.6180732	-0.2531	-0.27770898068	0.839117614	3346	4454	3378.5928	4346.1622	1.7505258	2.0974033	-0.2608	-0.232688201439	0.834615715	1287	1427	1322.1211	1414.0711	0.5833849	0.6368116	-0.1264	-0.174411373886	0.916102716	1316	1862	1351.3694	1842.8538	0.6265787	0.8349836	-0.4143	-0.161172816303	0.750408417	754	713	789.7118	715.752	0.273405	0.2484928	0.1378	-0.0306665986741	1.100253118	4301	4504	4333.8199	4394.3163	1.6903979	1.6085184	0.0716	-0.00168936029305	1.050903719	1235	1507	1271.4108	1492.9721	0.4506123	0.5278193	-0.2282	-0.227364854176	0.853724420	3061	2856	3087.1148	2803.1203	0.9465491	0.8658333	0.1286	-0.129010537873	1.0932233!sample_table_end
