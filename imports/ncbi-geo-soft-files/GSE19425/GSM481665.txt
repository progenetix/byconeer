Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481665/suppl/GSM481665_JA917.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1856	1701	1845.6459	1702.3874	1.1976673	1.0792856	0.1502	-0.039943040305	1.10968522	838	946	854.8671	964.2732	0.7448919	0.8075376	-0.1165	-0.282127143629	0.92242383	2623	2074	2582.8579	2062.6154	1.3140159	1.0565599	0.3146	0.0960267380395	1.24367374	2885	4727	2839.7812	4534.4296	1.433921	2.3224742	-0.6957	-0.856015883038	0.6174115	4174	7142	4093.13	6846.04	2.2762015	3.8495462	-0.7581	-0.917579737883	0.59129096	4419	4943	4328.442	4736.3553	2.3126234	2.5501304	-0.1410	-0.171879739598	0.90686487	2151	1563	2132.889	1572.1209	1.0112202	0.7866815	0.3622	0.329713645548	1.28542518	1411	1778	1411.6989	1774.6111	0.6763463	0.8826863	-0.3841	-0.404224611374	0.76623649	1382	1520	1382.2867	1531.7776	1.183651	1.2474738	-0.0758	-0.0219096835767	0.948838410	5547	6037	5436.5694	5770.7854	2.4912223	2.7622353	-0.1490	-0.0185713641277	0.901886311	15858	14625	15434.264	14349.895	7.3557845	7.1889794	0.0331	-0.170109826122	1.023202912	2506	3219	2468.9747	3118.4241	1.1579491	1.5683151	-0.4376	-0.466742047082	0.738339613	3708	4151	3647.0764	3992.0071	1.6194798	1.8260544	-0.1732	0.0192539868328	0.886873814	2496	3566	2459.2377	3446.1004	2.2594234	3.0073924	-0.4126	-0.444854294482	0.751289915	3934	3438	3863.7102	3323.7614	1.7428492	1.5706943	0.1500	0.0898308543559	1.109604416	2352	2470	2322.6653	2422.7079	1.0485202	1.1636472	-0.1503	0.0361914458028	0.901063717	1058	987	1068.9886	1004.651	0.8517795	0.7890266	0.1104	0.0253024197877	1.07953218	2501	2613	2464.1055	2554.3545	1.4808946	1.4757205	0.0050	0.117065837257	1.003506119	1521	1632	1521.0078	1637.0178	1.280068	1.3132012	-0.0369	0.0375225133207	0.974769120	1035	871	1046.5474	891.213	0.5722343	0.4785929	0.2578	0.0767805786769	1.1956597!sample_table_end
