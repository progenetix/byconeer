Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481704/suppl/GSM481704_JBH114.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2843	2848	2879.0432	2801.1789	1.4659684	1.3532258	-0.1155	0.00153867906185	0.92309342	1722	2286	1760.0161	2249.8501	1.0945998	1.1341713	0.0512	-0.0538585085273	1.03615163	2576	2429	2614.0429	2389.2919	1.1235817	0.9643119	-0.2205	0.145574425159	0.85824814	5897	6029	5865.3807	5978.5044	2.5813115	2.6338204	0.0291	-0.0668038560726	1.02034195	12812	14525	12464.682	14609.133	5.0440362	5.1415978	0.0276	-0.181317485242	1.0193426	5938	6317	5904.2562	6269.3278	2.7086067	2.6091115	-0.0540	-0.0200484710881	0.9632677	2735	2928	2771.1712	2880.4068	0.7869907	0.8477787	0.1073	0.0119159342903	1.07724118	2267	2462	2305.6069	2421.5356	0.8562768	0.906616	0.0824	-0.065825770053	1.05878859	3110	4049	3147.2583	3990.7091	1.9608823	1.999127	0.0279	-0.00403023831528	1.019503810	11544	10486	11257.734	10497.135	3.0782721	3.1661221	0.0406	0.11413417584	1.028538711	17942	15840	17256.6	15940.823	5.324451	5.3581885	0.0091	0.075131975236	1.006336312	4615	4267	4612.3023	4204.5503	1.4524739	1.4104208	-0.0424	-0.271893463932	0.971047213	7546	6477	7438.7087	6432.3083	1.8354188	1.8174291	-0.0142	0.0629390075524	0.990198614	3933	5422	3956.1843	5370.9362	2.8916193	2.936224	0.0221	-0.0484949946835	1.015425515	4787	4383	4781.0294	4318.8635	1.424511	1.26847	-0.1674	0.0691720042391	0.8904616	3842	3885	3867.2492	3829.9116	1.144283	1.2154816	0.0871	0.0811050681706	1.062221217	1391	1416	1429.7481	1395.318	0.8058669	0.697136	-0.2091	0.0687452304874	0.865075818	3248	4647	3284.6249	4585.6229	1.5653272	1.5782974	0.0119	0.0448654975945	1.008285919	2375	2329	2413.082	2291.4977	1.2470644	1.1216025	-0.1530	0.142461145686	0.899394220	2375	1889	2413.082	1859.1053	0.6457316	0.5404059	-0.2569	-0.0480420305762	0.8368895!sample_table_end
