Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481503/suppl/GSM481503_DE422.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2776	2760	2825.4867	2675.6542	0.9912066	0.9168905	0.1124	-0.10810522994	1.08105222	2833	2765	2879.6968	2680.5324	0.9029856	0.8519506	0.0839	0.214922668661	1.05990373	5088	4293	5075.9429	4226.7385	1.479565	1.2264599	0.2707	0.0395971751999	1.20637044	9245	10156	8947.7154	10314.297	2.7455054	3.0385718	-0.1463	0.0227792731207	0.90355135	13152	11546	12361.95	11830.712	3.8740575	3.7217218	0.0579	0.0863411087439	1.04093156	10098	13741	9703.2746	14238.481	3.0927763	4.7203795	-0.6100	-0.503649409284	0.65519657	1841	2159	1924.1905	2076.526	0.8523141	0.9236793	-0.1160	-0.121560299221	0.92273828	2099	2341	2176.7171	2256.9902	0.6358654	0.6391995	-0.0075	0.240984194959	0.99478419	4335	3570	4350.5663	3480.8579	1.2134952	0.9911235	0.2920	0.116647678179	1.224363210	13433	14421	12603.772	14996.669	4.0885262	4.7083659	-0.2036	-0.483432638535	0.868353511	24602	22921	21865.978	24662.261	6.606476	7.2040847	-0.1249	-0.397108371887	0.917045912	10374	12660	9946.5956	13038.518	3.633724	4.6627539	-0.3597	-0.0492569885445	0.779308513	6671	5707	6587.0256	5646.4672	2.5557781	2.1460311	0.2521	-0.151519422853	1.190932514	10210	9718	9802.105	9836.5755	3.3712935	3.5739579	-0.0842	-0.14588926108	0.943294115	5560	4533	5527.2778	4468.1079	1.7064142	1.3323919	0.3569	0.0707230327471	1.280714916	3373	3318	3410.9319	3224.5061	1.2082609	1.1280557	0.0991	-0.106317115517	1.071100417	3047	2346	3086.3818	2261.8772	0.917683	0.6879651	0.4157	0.0436180380044	1.333909218	3845	4091	3873.79	4020.8197	1.8336244	1.9430208	-0.0836	-0.186182762632	0.943697819	4351	3587	4366.1738	3498.4596	1.2926844	1.0489096	0.3015	-0.0449338522717	1.232407820	1739	1947	1824.1113	1870.9152	0.5407066	0.5417117	-0.0027	-0.0610633145979	0.9981446!sample_table_end
