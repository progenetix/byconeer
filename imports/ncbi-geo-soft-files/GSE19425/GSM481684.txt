Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481684/suppl/GSM481684_JA948.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2632	1936	2489.4583	2032.4471	1.1594342	0.9127719	-0.3451	-0.0928169708929	0.78725632	2350	2213	2219.9644	2316.6415	1.0061044	1.0602072	0.0756	-0.0286518804335	1.05377463	2520	1737	2381.8468	1827.0362	1.4014559	1.0476665	-0.4197	-0.16280447368	0.74755594	6111	6080	5776.7212	6301.4868	3.3648712	3.4895083	0.0525	0.176542351989	1.03704075	7447	7681	7043.1301	7942.4088	4.9157138	5.359319	0.1246	-0.0183763114504	1.09024236	6220	6201	5880.6376	6426.1156	3.3730681	3.539345	0.0694	0.0902471002101	1.04929547	622	727	588.9643	777.4366	0.8646035	1.1781184	0.4464	0.296814828417	1.36261128	1651	1672	1560.2786	1759.3457	0.9633952	1.085636	0.1723	0.0694060366576	1.12688549	2934	2975	2780.4165	3099.7295	1.1829188	1.3592104	0.2004	0.0475358760848	1.14903110	2978	2417	2822.7746	2525.3683	2.4468303	2.2432352	-0.1253	-0.105447263018	0.916792311	7787	5558	7362.8648	5765.4275	5.8902853	4.7264202	-0.3176	-0.104437236116	0.802409412	2579	2412	2438.4655	2520.2269	2.1091142	2.1972511	0.0591	0.0628543430759	1.041788613	1218	967	1150.3599	1025.4537	1.3916704	1.3448753	-0.0493	-0.060207349836	0.966374814	8562	9176	8092.1257	9477.8206	3.2245087	3.9221343	0.2826	0.129239751933	1.21635115	1850	1589	1747.2949	1673.6057	1.3492119	1.3125347	-0.0398	0.00603887212781	0.972815816	918	800	868.8541	853.7713	0.8413235	0.8519372	0.0181	0.0266340779101	1.012615417	1508	1125	1425.6083	1188.8524	0.6426255	0.5332987	-0.2690	-0.0450909249163	0.829874818	3252	2822	3083.5869	2943.4962	1.4362318	1.3935475	-0.0435	-0.0216325606961	0.970280419	2114	1681	1997.006	1768.6706	0.9319593	0.8234629	-0.1786	-0.02254314607	0.883582420	896	779	847.9415	831.6515	0.5119728	0.4933485	-0.0535	0.0869915970673	0.9636226!sample_table_end
