Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481760/suppl/GSM481760_JBH530.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1403	1255	1340.7008	1320.7752	0.8209941	0.774917	-0.0833	0.190986341906	0.94387642	1143	1679	1086.1236	1742.2424	0.9098491	1.2299674	0.4349	0.246789066533	1.35183663	1570	1254	1503.0603	1319.7648	0.7207254	0.6823206	-0.0790	0.04146953346	0.94671374	10515	7706	10198.575	7570.941	4.8827259	3.916981	-0.3179	0.0529797844852	0.80221195	15091	15119	14524.434	14616.31	7.1392227	7.9531634	0.1558	0.0992737910156	1.11400976	7374	6181	7180.3518	6125.162	3.9089258	3.5501679	-0.1389	-0.0939144142508	0.90822087	3009	2497	2908.7054	2549.7631	1.4900142	1.3861998	-0.1042	-0.105812920033	0.93032658	2004	1673	1927.1959	1736.1941	0.9374388	0.8843882	-0.0840	-0.023010029631	0.94340899	1438	1285	1374.9746	1351.064	1.1157001	0.9151342	-0.2859	-0.198879280868	0.820233110	7137	6866	6953.6306	6778.0356	4.1053212	3.8669702	-0.0863	0.0139892876734	0.941940911	6583	4149	6410.7272	4157.7579	3.2786304	2.2093863	-0.5694	-0.530679483484	0.673874712	7388	6243	7193.7379	6184.8936	3.5500138	3.2090905	-0.1457	0.160237779168	0.903965613	1803	1727	1732.6742	1790.6997	1.0766466	1.0251521	-0.0707	0.0533521595211	0.952171414	3989	4887	3870.6585	4870.0664	3.7964576	4.0075331	0.0781	0.0402109951333	1.05559815	1744	1409	1675.777	1474.56	0.7681135	0.7117419	-0.1100	0.0851749844996	0.926610316	1613	1670	1545.6462	1733.1717	0.7143868	0.8529718	0.2558	0.176006621815	1.193991617	311	266	242.9728	328.1179	0.1947231	0.2284588	0.2305	0.196461382452	1.173249618	2797	2184	2704.7952	2241.7275	1.5381457	1.2923184	-0.2512	-0.038191307495	0.840179419	739	650	695.4874	714.5476	0.5690013	0.4945813	-0.2022	-0.108501610981	0.869209320	1680	1243	1612.2338	1308.651	0.9353909	0.7205586	-0.3765	0.0485318101778	0.7703288!sample_table_end
