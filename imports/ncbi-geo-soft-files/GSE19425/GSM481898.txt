Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481898/suppl/GSM481898_MR312.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6308	4465	6009.6587	4611.5502	1.595916	1.2161094	0.3921	0.0247884434549	1.31231292	5831	4537	5568.5944	4681.3447	1.5489173	1.3263895	0.2238	0.138181037846	1.16776963	5416	4375	5179.8295	4524.214	1.2707124	1.0976248	0.2113	0.269343202775	1.15769294	12656	10618	11906.389	10791.358	2.9671748	2.6923422	0.1402	0.125558665718	1.10207945	16113	15527	15076.96	15881.371	3.8158265	3.959925	-0.0535	0.00452771106702	0.96361086	7769	8965	7385.1293	9140.0699	1.9407144	2.369364	-0.2879	0.022217658393	0.81908667	2470	2979	2400.8965	3108.2697	0.6987383	0.837614	-0.2615	0.0389624516085	0.83420088	3503	3095	3365.1449	3229.8243	0.8281535	0.8080153	0.0355	-0.137747633975	1.0249239	6532	5531	6220.6819	5673.8618	1.6135515	1.4973116	0.1079	-0.174124712537	1.077632410	14216	11793	13337.843	11982.893	3.4516573	3.1760569	0.1201	-0.0344960048882	1.086774411	22420	19157	20788.948	19760.181	5.2443434	5.1588691	0.0237	-0.0733815702945	1.016568412	9246	10056	8759.1918	10223.007	2.4459389	2.8220867	-0.2064	0.062602668266	0.866712913	6801	5471	6470.8117	5612.6067	1.9596445	1.6614697	0.2381	-0.0721082478343	1.179464514	12331	10733	11604.431	10907.822	3.2504404	3.0634406	0.0855	0.000713236364559	1.061042415	5246	4275	5019.8118	4423.8763	1.3162863	1.1450399	0.2011	-0.066928509599	1.149554916	4192	4079	4029.0417	4224.8968	1.1140603	1.1265134	-0.0160	-0.118011251152	0.988945417	1914	1713	1882.4007	1804.6556	0.5350885	0.5181818	0.0463	0.0409694190741	1.03262718	4501	5244	4328.2563	5380.8259	1.4263873	1.4839898	-0.0571	-0.0999767161557	0.961184119	4052	3051	3890.8027	3183.4493	1.0703748	0.8878257	0.2698	0.00098098757075	1.205613620	3639	2641	3494.6849	2762.9985	0.8249535	0.6995105	0.2380	0.0858758867958	1.1793297!sample_table_end
