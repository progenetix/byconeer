Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481799/suppl/GSM481799_MR041.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3291	5062	3749.6143	4424.0366	1.1392877	1.2471678	-0.1305	-0.084353593107	0.91352	3435	5527	3902.8286	4838.8354	1.163652	1.1206394	0.0543	0.0796626451609	1.03838223	3678	4294	4158.7017	3748.842	1.1562909	1.0949765	0.0786	0.0313923729948	1.0559964	9993	12149	10671.566	10708.4	2.7795494	3.1781558	-0.1933	-0.0847295935034	0.87457935	15237	18272	15867.322	16353.201	5.6657851	5.9442198	-0.0692	-0.155494002887	0.95315876	9979	9643	10657.47	8460.4898	3.4973318	2.8572776	0.2916	0.232658915051	1.22400847	4300	3971	4831.9368	3458.7897	1.2527594	1.0845169	0.2081	0.225627477016	1.15513138	3018	3472	3453.2789	3022.1171	0.8596616	0.9113641	-0.0843	-0.0296881057485	0.94326919	8751	13256	9413.6198	11716.69	2.6195246	2.6469829	-0.0150	-0.0450892131446	0.989626610	11854	15226	12521.991	13535.111	4.6288812	5.0718067	-0.1318	-0.0409439070325	0.912669111	13851	14580	14505.304	12936.397	4.5724596	4.6211263	-0.0153	0.0515622673708	0.989468712	6514	7312	7128.2866	6407.2495	1.8065585	2.0324261	-0.1700	0.0929618812813	0.88886813	6020	6370	6621.1489	5570.5385	1.8437703	1.9106014	-0.0514	0.015445758186	0.965020914	9252	13340	9922.7011	11792.83	2.8073038	2.7625149	0.0232	-0.0356147948122	1.016213115	6184	5286	6790.3543	4625.7642	1.6483147	1.3979769	0.2377	0.0808558753449	1.179071516	4635	4996	5180.6101	4363.955	1.2954561	1.3551015	-0.0649	0.0273192653126	0.955984517	2007	3458	2343.1749	3009.7867	0.6734457	0.6950989	-0.0457	0.281779068427	0.968848718	6756	10905	7373.4964	9583.5264	2.0445137	2.0702077	-0.0180	0.0484266255715	0.987588719	3503	4986	3974.0856	4354.8543	1.1590331	1.0774132	0.1054	0.0710129869277	1.075755420	1448	2272	1711.4504	1979.7482	0.6763936	0.6422933	0.0746	-0.112288501046	1.0530914!sample_table_end
