Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481947/suppl/GSM481947_MR373.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4829	5462	5014.6682	5182.7894	1.5397727	1.6601521	-0.1086	-0.00600049704361	0.92748892	5413	4881	5543.7802	4572.8622	1.6760136	1.4549541	0.2041	0.0914929512198	1.15193573	2814	2480	3118.2932	2217.8621	0.8328872	0.5980203	0.4779	0.0786484973124	1.39274054	15264	11435	14278.05	11264.36	3.6056868	2.868928	0.3298	0.00126930163725	1.25680635	20584	18784	18818.075	18647.359	5.2866044	4.9681904	0.0896	-0.121647708636	1.06409056	8729	9324	8521.0908	9074.9975	2.4969758	2.6823926	-0.1033	-0.0936105952099	0.93087637	3190	3417	3478.6909	3113.2863	0.8437735	0.7111182	0.2468	0.0995214388896	1.18654478	3585	5225	3853.0136	4933.92	0.9065905	1.2233628	-0.4323	-0.174312177958	0.74106439	2802	4560	3106.3346	4259.7024	0.8765776	1.255372	-0.5182	-0.207499165319	0.698261210	12147	9178	11585.886	8923.1054	3.2720927	2.6409725	0.3091	0.0653504793156	1.238972611	14484	14971	13608.459	14840.425	3.7759082	4.2463818	-0.1694	-0.149119209089	0.88920612	15777	15069	14723.194	14939.798	3.4731139	3.4334104	0.0166	-0.194090409329	1.011563813	4506	6136	4720.3067	5850.286	1.1992926	1.4737693	-0.2973	-0.164567657377	0.813758614	14195	14491	13362.224	14353.631	4.4040194	4.8937658	-0.1521	-0.192562145971	0.899924415	4389	5037	4611.7085	4735.7049	1.0254468	1.0579427	-0.0450	-0.0183338499263	0.969283816	2816	5021	3120.2863	4718.9789	0.7326335	1.0380216	-0.5027	-0.233698978757	0.705797917	1247	1175	1484.1161	1039.8336	0.4723668	0.3597215	0.3930	0.235269000371	1.313145918	6587	6540	6629.0213	6265.359	1.8435503	1.6680248	0.1443	0.0738979516817	1.105229519	2170	3101	2473.4879	2809.218	0.8060427	1.0018184	-0.3137	-0.166370608345	0.804579620	1787	2713	2077.5431	2436.169	0.6124663	0.770005	-0.3302	-0.243711314924	0.7954056!sample_table_end
