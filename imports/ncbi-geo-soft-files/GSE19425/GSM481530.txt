Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481530/suppl/GSM481530_DE494.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4024	2990	3646.5269	3301.4516	0.8302253	0.7953823	0.0619	0.141149455995	1.04380662	6773	5521	6194.9407	5966.9756	1.8277356	1.7991429	0.0227	-0.0039277555374	1.01589243	3855	3829	3491.6867	4185.1198	0.7825649	0.9773805	-0.3207	0.333710984639	0.80067584	20829	16259	18537.18	17392.559	4.5008966	4.4445558	0.0182	0.0544446742097	1.01267645	24074	17513	21248.34	18762.47	5.4207968	4.67282	0.2142	-0.201744008649	1.16006976	14065	10209	12765.349	10891.98	3.0763792	2.7485966	0.1625	-0.158985245406	1.11925457	3947	3537	3575.9864	3873.9452	0.9910921	1.0334145	-0.0603	0.0321850743452	0.95904618	4484	3280	4070.2028	3606.7908	1.0154781	0.9733968	0.0611	-0.0606603284421	1.04323159	4074	3039	3691.6298	3353.4899	1.1316498	0.9574258	0.2412	-0.246157156343	1.181971310	10054	8670	9189.0926	9270.1767	3.0984191	3.3044838	-0.0929	0.220454281353	0.937640911	11938	10361	10880.021	11054.329	3.1304934	3.4634692	-0.1458	-0.0382558385628	0.903860612	9566	11016	8748.4476	11745.902	2.2462214	3.1862486	-0.5044	0.356827237811	0.704973713	1941	1997	1748.9663	2235.5096	0.558984	0.7021906	-0.3291	0.362555508091	0.796057414	14445	12519	13094.593	13344.319	3.9656769	3.7561001	0.0783	-0.147637265982	1.055796415	2616	2345	2357.8406	2610.8489	0.5907151	0.7005099	-0.2459	0.403778275126	0.843264516	2976	3263	2682.7458	3589.1335	0.6670152	0.8831106	-0.4049	0.182519290848	0.75530217	653	564	606.6331	636.6403	0.1667251	0.1854061	-0.1532	0.0440350971893	0.899243218	6254	6370	5704.473	6858.914	1.5849685	1.7548994	-0.1469	0.126753660937	0.903167719	1693	1350	1527.2995	1527.2026	0.5049262	0.5126166	-0.0218	0.0902815222014	0.984997820	1181	1126	1079.8116	1278.2751	0.5465097	0.6301361	-0.2054	0.194408343869	0.8672884!sample_table_end
