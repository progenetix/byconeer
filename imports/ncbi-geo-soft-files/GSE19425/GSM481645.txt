Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481645/suppl/GSM481645_JA801.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1739	2193	1906.5153	1927.7262	1.0401066	1.2389344	-0.2524	-0.209047844984	0.8395172	1952	2061	2116.7267	1816.6905	1.4164341	1.0736861	0.3997	0.0589955281874	1.31922553	1647	1924	1823.6634	1697.353	0.891911	1.0842753	-0.2818	-0.0835309225654	0.82258724	6980	4339	6571.2518	3762.7178	2.8354569	2.1862346	0.3751	0.110232800191	1.29695915	12985	9789	11619.78	8636.8909	5.7697778	4.8084208	0.2630	0.0261231261159	1.1999326	7501	3531	7017.1303	3054.8757	3.7340332	2.1354445	0.8062	0.774321864998	1.74859767	2644	2039	2768.5376	1797.7168	1.9891912	0.8763201	1.1827	0.628413307983	2.26993678	2836	1523	2948.5646	1363.7119	1.148174	0.6716969	0.7735	0.381900193514	1.70936319	2323	3006	2475.7558	2623.2831	1.5891528	1.4356868	0.1465	-0.139560980617	1.106893810	4461	5923	4386.7418	5140.8482	1.8776847	2.4457104	-0.3813	0.0618974134332	0.767746111	13056	12807	11678.738	11439.021	4.7437358	5.6108176	-0.2422	-0.07811962512	0.845462512	2676	4317	2798.3793	3742.9654	1.5391822	1.6903353	-0.1351	0.0184272258423	0.91057813	1449	4738	1637.975	4102.3448	0.9749638	1.7441388	-0.8391	-0.300004380665	0.558994414	3962	5012	3950.8191	4338.9273	3.5913202	3.1293654	0.1986	-0.0489496532361	1.147619315	3307	5355	3381.5004	4640.4689	1.5195017	1.974241	-0.3777	0.0476757418687	0.769663816	1046	2662	1228.5791	2340.1043	0.6949745	1.0335177	-0.5725	-0.217416426649	0.67243617	889	1478	1069.4546	1326.7282	0.6755098	0.8069205	-0.2564	-0.253406771681	0.837145418	1523	2236	1707.7755	1963.2517	1.3530314	1.7002843	-0.3296	-0.04533172445	0.795767719	800	2067	973.3939	1821.8642	0.6223182	1.0321294	-0.7299	-0.231514109889	0.602945920	930	1031	1109.7493	947.0312	0.5265164	0.5155041	0.0305	-0.364996534798	1.0213622!sample_table_end
