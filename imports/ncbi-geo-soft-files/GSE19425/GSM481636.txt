Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9775!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481636/suppl/GSM481636_JA693.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1332	1365	1426.7297	1303.2066	0.545442	0.4949737	-0.1401	-0.057737381645	0.90747272	2459	2475	2580.6149	2354.5622	0.7631335	0.6769687	-0.1728	-0.11155548735	0.88709083	4421	3972	4550.3625	3795.2647	1.4355534	1.201701	-0.2565	-0.188077981979	0.83709954	7678	6567	7692.0363	6351.8488	3.1187444	2.5085788	-0.3141	-0.447247985135	0.80435535	19588	13836	18559.503	13860.435	5.6159626	4.1689494	-0.4298	-0.515062679853	0.74233926	6793	8198	6851.4808	8018.0494	1.6474485	1.8325947	0.1537	0.17247292207	1.11238367	3365	4449	3495.5315	4260.8278	0.8287071	0.967174	0.2229	0.172164889243	1.16708788	3129	3301	3257.2833	3143.2149	0.8447364	0.8110889	-0.0586	-0.0937630047913	0.96016819	4643	4605	4767.2066	4411.5994	1.3072562	1.1838208	-0.1431	-0.145300489372	0.905576710	7562	8329	7582.061	8151.7595	3.999667	3.8296883	-0.0627	-0.0475513655823	0.957501711	3410	3411	3540.9307	3250.4689	1.9294051	1.6933403	-0.1883	-0.0582831675202	0.877648912	5912	5400	6005.0296	5198.1294	2.3463196	2.0536459	-0.1922	-0.348808999153	0.875262613	1946	1898	2052.922	1807.8674	1.1306901	0.9469446	-0.2559	-0.0965390744423	0.837492614	10273	7166	10125.996	6954.7912	3.5747055	2.4458921	-0.5475	-0.350701982562	0.684221915	1076	1158	1160.396	1108.2835	0.4899017	0.462922	-0.0817	-0.0689642928727	0.944928316	3969	4206	4102.8065	4024.1149	1.5445479	1.4239224	-0.1173	-0.0975384602679	0.921902317	986	938	1067.5928	899.4488	0.3069838	0.2609978	-0.2341	0.000955613174399	0.850200318	3676	4414	3808.0847	4226.7184	1.2047493	1.3573284	0.1720	0.158219900396	1.12664819	1545	1514	1643.5377	1442.1007	0.5691188	0.5196182	-0.1313	-0.0284039168122	0.913022420	3456	3306	3587.3233	3148.0868	1.1217923	0.9927623	-0.1763	-0.148051374344	0.8849786!sample_table_end
