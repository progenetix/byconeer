Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481568/suppl/GSM481568_EL630.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2607	2418	2707.3902	2337.6396	0.7697535	0.6344096	-0.2790	-0.0733082236115	0.82417242	4136	4490	4288.8435	4296.7079	1.5618928	1.4855614	-0.0723	0.0711894582199	0.95112893	2324	2006	2410.6174	1956.2888	0.675107	0.5573923	-0.2764	-0.0670781110719	0.82563544	17166	13481	17013.3	12889.785	4.7691542	3.8215783	-0.3196	-0.3133301647	0.80131155	12390	18552	12475.183	17839.787	3.9823991	5.4470413	0.4518	-0.171930203949	1.36777886	10489	9194	10626.485	8754.4484	3.379708	2.7159123	-0.3155	-0.236191205774	0.80359377	2657	3119	2760.1884	3000.0662	0.9118094	1.0026028	0.1369	-0.228247975179	1.0995758	2439	2668	2530.9511	2571.8635	0.7699873	0.8078175	0.0692	-0.099975340023	1.04913089	3138	3260	3253.7067	3129.3457	1.1259678	1.0408802	-0.1134	-0.0287975942076	0.924431510	14863	16155	14838.528	15500.229	5.1155792	5.1533107	0.0106	-0.0941595144711	1.007375811	7884	5164	8052.1261	4933.1202	2.549473	1.5650713	-0.7040	-0.561532289473	0.613880312	8913	8410	9070.2301	8003.9385	2.8310305	2.4706298	-0.1964	-0.143586451738	0.872696213	1717	1493	1779.5887	1475.5602	0.6130135	0.5412471	-0.1796	-0.145140670536	0.882928514	4380	4280	4533.6037	4095.8985	1.7149802	1.5002577	-0.1930	-0.0722009475885	0.874795915	1970	1922	2040.4398	1877.9145	0.5860708	0.5539981	-0.0812	-0.0556284953482	0.945275116	1867	2375	1935.6421	2297.1231	0.5929843	0.7233119	0.2866	-0.0188221013748	1.219782617	503	448	494.3681	481.1736	0.1755923	0.160318	-0.1313	0.0625873342982	0.913012618	4312	4102	4465.437	3925.2997	1.4839862	1.2225878	-0.2795	-0.159072278002	0.823853819	1587	1657	1641.2384	1629.9531	0.5736721	0.5295095	-0.1156	-0.0301233367719	0.923017620	3122	3054	3236.8641	2939.7426	1.0197443	0.9126097	-0.1601	-0.00367032209539	0.8949397!sample_table_end
