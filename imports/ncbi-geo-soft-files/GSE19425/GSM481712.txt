Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481712/suppl/GSM481712_JBH210.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2985	3318	2978.2599	3358.2265	0.8686453	0.8706827	0.0034	0.0959836789567	1.00234542	3727	3794	3727.9926	3802.4271	1.1183871	1.2230952	0.1291	0.212754465055	1.09362413	4997	5219	5057.3207	5110.629	1.008981	1.0139613	0.0071	0.259058877022	1.00493594	17918	17022	17942.912	16150.646	3.104417	2.7894131	-0.1544	-0.134026898389	0.89853045	19688	17156	19650.359	16279.91	4.1750443	3.53729	-0.2391	-0.14251286122	0.84724616	8423	11967	8561.6645	11306.873	2.0191343	2.5199226	0.3196	0.19387668579	1.24802127	2734	3719	2710.4076	3733.9596	0.6945287	0.8640614	0.3151	0.281814313769	1.24409748	4578	3824	4628.7649	3830.0979	0.7985757	0.6659474	-0.2620	-0.156730575361	0.83391899	3626	3184	3622.555	3232.8289	1.0498573	1.0087715	-0.0576	-0.131423123872	0.960865210	16323	17330	16381.063	16447.717	2.9926987	3.1773882	0.0864	0.0636817149688	1.061713311	20698	21453	20613.009	20465.494	3.6219969	3.7867575	0.0642	0.104198154442	1.045488812	5098	6537	5162.1602	6320.8251	0.9798896	1.2392665	0.3388	0.202098835842	1.264713	5166	4773	5233.0067	4703.1104	1.0584816	1.0652644	0.0092	0.186427787184	1.00640814	6138	6693	6235.1324	6462.0979	2.0255431	2.2645289	0.1609	0.161652963398	1.11798615	5604	5443	5685.1387	5313.367	0.9777025	0.9428709	-0.0523	0.0809739983828	0.96437416	7295	7071	7432.3338	6804.0255	1.4703413	1.3853878	-0.0859	-0.10962420833	0.942221917	1115	936	1034.4238	1069.6601	0.3224464	0.3305981	0.0360	0.250131724645	1.025280718	5103	5178	5167.3714	5073.4214	1.4715876	1.4137376	-0.0579	-0.0334232328195	0.960688619	2801	2930	2781.488	2999.2222	0.9869767	0.9014869	-0.1307	0.0343546244033	0.913382120	4092	4030	4124.2691	4019.612	0.7749185	0.7530617	-0.0413	-0.118802176844	0.9717948!sample_table_end
