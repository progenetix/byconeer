Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481863/suppl/GSM481863_MR267.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4347	4728	4421.3372	4633.2123	1.0847129	1.0651541	0.0263	-0.040593152982	1.01836242	6589	6619	6654.0971	6504.5129	1.8764628	1.6146301	0.2168	0.0886921045969	1.16216263	4379	4599	4453.9876	4506.7563	0.9556322	0.9357506	0.0303	-0.0118703018322	1.02124664	15771	12777	15601.194	12610.95	3.1862243	2.6299023	0.2768	0.151661292931	1.21153715	19309	18061	19122.676	17730.827	4.1591876	3.8396096	0.1153	-0.0482299776052	1.08323196	10668	10392	10626.485	10242.73	2.4831384	2.3147438	0.1013	0.0738617658622	1.07274877	3860	3925	3939.8963	3851.882	0.8728446	0.885277	-0.0204	-0.0312682843395	0.98595658	4129	4335	4202.63	4250.1584	0.7844006	0.8309498	-0.0832	-0.0807706689159	0.94398069	7475	9885	7509.4377	9741.0292	1.9202504	2.1738708	-0.1790	-0.0583745174617	0.883332310	15069	13085	14914.117	12921.872	4.5402594	4.3870377	0.0495	0.128832759886	1.034925911	23423	23748	23265.782	23192.456	4.912855	5.3419189	-0.1208	-0.0880855183541	0.919679812	14412	14138	14273.585	13947.752	2.6985376	2.8076331	-0.0572	-0.0713956808732	0.961143213	5364	5646	5445.053	5537.6983	1.3243909	1.5121778	-0.1913	-0.132342877227	0.875816914	10500	12181	10462.256	12013.306	2.9316801	2.8150439	0.0586	-0.00721219809907	1.041433115	5520	5345	5598.2693	5241.5475	0.9931706	0.9995012	-0.0092	0.0512345431536	0.993666216	5280	5889	5361.5556	5779.3772	1.0085883	1.1445276	-0.1824	-0.0069558740786	0.881226717	1761	2218	1809.1066	2187.7669	0.4984084	0.538511	-0.1116	-0.00279231004817	0.925530618	5699	7317	5773.29	7201.4188	1.2942833	1.491098	-0.2042	-0.0621102592052	0.868006819	3658	4231	3739.1872	4150.3655	1.0376612	1.0315184	0.0086	0.0719892822828	1.005955120	2649	2330	2714.9866	2295.6405	0.8229693	0.7596836	0.1154	0.0339501166576	1.0833053!sample_table_end
