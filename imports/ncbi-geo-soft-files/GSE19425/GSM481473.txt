Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481473/suppl/GSM481473_DE370.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4275	1550	2841.7305	2177.3399	1.2615574	1.2094387	0.0609	0.0626378943313	1.04309332	2203	1078	1572.7672	1494.8606	0.7796637	0.8796052	-0.1740	-0.130367702347	0.88637923	4002	1666	2673.4848	2342.3884	1.3658716	1.3102688	0.0600	-0.00984453060759	1.04243624	5250	2275	3427.4446	3250.0752	1.8280281	1.9224051	-0.0726	-0.162452615293	0.95090685	10925	5239	6812.0114	7590.2218	4.2498635	4.5347119	-0.0936	-0.143707272912	0.93718496	6520	3197	4163.9482	4591.675	2.1113924	2.6489713	-0.3272	-0.299929072966	0.79706137	1257	780	946.907	1072.7468	1.0062923	0.8330471	0.2726	0.135646104681	1.20796578	1360	680	1018.3035	938.524	0.5704591	0.5560127	0.0370	-0.0411873702376	1.02598229	4156	1732	2769.1673	2439.5576	1.3601889	1.3834814	-0.0245	0.00352927260216	0.983163910	6452	4205	4124.0842	6068.3507	3.0612815	4.1031801	-0.4226	-0.166624593025	0.746075311	20087	9011	12178.934	13372.805	8.4002045	9.0867962	-0.1133	-0.0357287963908	0.924440712	1738	1247	1266.9971	1735.244	1.2166052	1.2721253	-0.0644	-0.00576526052509	0.956356513	3022	2605	2080.8218	3730.8308	2.4090476	2.9470112	-0.2908	-0.15219708485	0.817454514	10417	4099	6502.2057	5914.4341	3.4538082	3.3991761	0.0230	-0.0556348378661	1.016072215	3569	2433	2406.538	3485.7677	1.9748113	2.3711773	-0.2639	-0.0194816712157	0.8328416	1769	1433	1288.0324	2009.2962	1.2268785	1.445014	-0.2361	-0.0198794594332	0.849042717	3944	1380	2637.3354	1931.0787	1.2044714	1.0986752	0.1326	0.146657698288	1.096294418	4743	2514	3126.804	3601.1541	1.3853501	1.8422743	-0.4112	-0.36724418014	0.751978319	3776	1855	2532.6473	2622.5664	1.2937514	1.6105981	-0.3160	-0.228567705934	0.803273920	1276	615	959.9287	853.7591	0.6129042	0.5605956	0.1287	-0.0851905070226	1.0933091!sample_table_end
