Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481484/suppl/GSM481484_DE391.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1543	1231	1410.6896	1344.7287	1.1032271	1.0298399	-0.0993	-0.0234827098463	0.93347952	1354	1153	1233.8365	1265.2813	1.2433623	1.3512575	0.1201	-0.78293871887	1.08677693	2121	1730	1947.525	1849.4985	1.2077739	1.1148973	-0.1154	0.149690548494	0.92310094	4708	3600	4324.8316	3705.2797	2.4790621	2.31519	-0.0987	-0.0105640387884	0.93389755	12849	9219	11409.832	9541.7039	6.0988823	5.9517903	-0.0352	-0.0978290116646	0.97588216	6752	5152	6157.8028	5267.2287	3.5742326	3.2281357	-0.1469	-0.156436101602	0.90316897	1218	1337	1106.199	1450.1479	0.9228595	1.065725	0.2077	0.0977515536497	1.15480748	1167	827	1059.3464	926.8002	0.7395735	0.6619973	-0.1599	-0.0934559236442	0.89510679	1241	933	1127.4829	1038.3085	1.1495088	1.104711	-0.0573	-0.115805410161	0.961028710	4640	4352	4263.4983	4462.6953	3.4672465	3.1255933	-0.1497	-0.0959313964378	0.901462611	11095	8902	9923.4582	9200.4833	7.8325988	6.6126169	-0.2443	-0.204812590168	0.84424312	2173	2623	1996.8594	2744.1923	1.5577476	1.9888965	0.3525	0.155733303372	1.276777113	2388	2206	2200.2206	2334.6542	1.9722938	1.8524122	-0.0905	-0.0345875159775	0.939217214	2206	2338	2028.1864	2466.1732	2.1173698	2.4017424	0.1818	-0.17398688011	1.134304615	2520	2282	2323.608	2410.5519	1.4977627	1.451989	-0.0448	0.0833212216307	0.969438616	1498	1321	1368.1174	1434.1741	1.0555316	1.0125934	-0.0599	-0.00275504579582	0.959320817	748	561	677.4349	647.8329	0.6034464	0.6203304	0.0398	0.195030674604	1.027979318	3541	2275	3254.0884	2403.5666	1.6740766	1.4426891	-0.2146	-0.0533388399933	0.86178219	1055	780	956.8033	875.8899	0.9711742	0.9005263	-0.1090	0.0443145153705	0.927255220	832	634	753.0931	724.9384	0.7170141	0.5706826	-0.3293	0.0602805486299	0.7959154!sample_table_end
