Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481846/suppl/GSM481846_MR230.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5669	5739	5451.5895	5941.7346	1.1821114	1.2664628	0.0994	0.163696058859	1.07135652	6297	7644	6046.7738	7895.7137	1.2378586	1.5858378	0.3574	0.221187391519	1.28111393	5411	5199	5210.0059	5391.3147	1.4379847	1.4835556	0.0450	0.0929065562257	1.03169084	11580	11204	11062.544	11537.251	3.0232784	3.1854287	0.0754	0.125839790131	1.05363395	14645	14042	13924.135	14491.339	4.0629067	4.1840531	0.0424	0.180521410962	1.02981776	8332	7772	7996.126	8026.8478	2.375973	2.3382492	-0.0231	-0.00729977624511	0.98412287	3478	3621	3357.2306	3753.9544	0.7964338	0.7817686	-0.0268	0.0217322835383	0.98158658	2877	2733	2781.4084	2845.3724	0.6677439	0.688342	0.0438	0.052216518563	1.03084729	9818	9274	9403.1847	9569.2063	1.802004	1.800927	-0.0009	0.0168334560897	0.999402310	15042	12984	14290.161	13374.973	3.2389302	3.1490787	-0.0406	-0.0279934894912	0.972258911	23868	20977	22460.427	21776.473	5.1227129	5.2079502	0.0238	0.01307401094	1.016639112	13652	16034	12987.908	16577.287	2.6823398	3.3006023	0.2992	0.0858546811691	1.230493713	10202	11105	9766.265	11436.523	2.0406544	2.2277771	0.1266	0.0895320483507	1.091697414	13462	15341	12812.525	15856.264	3.0253257	3.5354526	0.2248	0.139488224413	1.168618815	7241	7326	6953.6107	7569.858	1.3308188	1.4879006	0.1610	0.138731128253	1.118033916	6242	7684	5994.4672	7936.6997	1.2923651	1.5353332	0.2485	0.121645008234	1.188002617	3672	3150	3546.6321	3271.7352	0.7147475	0.6456414	-0.1467	-0.0401120604078	0.903314118	5215	5091	5025.0039	5278.0649	1.5509862	1.5717007	0.0191	0.0848180801319	1.013355719	6727	6504	6459.0973	6726.5714	1.2824823	1.3390876	0.0623	0.101907264316	1.044137220	3561	3400	3438.2973	3524.715	0.7032291	0.7586223	0.1094	0.100899625743	1.0787698!sample_table_end
