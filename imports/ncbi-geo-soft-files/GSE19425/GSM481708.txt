Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481708/suppl/GSM481708_JBH204.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2601	3293	2846.0306	2984.8752	1.4927006	1.5654117	0.0686	0.0760560821812	1.04871112	1119	1456	1267.2442	1296.6133	0.7293614	0.7419215	0.0246	-0.0353710577458	1.01722053	4070	4856	4374.9434	4436.2	1.7916815	1.8111264	0.0156	0.11049701555	1.01085284	4215	4598	4524.5764	4199.8775	2.2424423	1.8709186	-0.2613	-0.171549838872	0.83432185	10258	9323	10884.514	8559.1092	4.0060552	3.2602271	-0.2972	-0.255975118498	0.81382486	5385	7292	5740.9296	6702.9226	2.5328063	2.9682212	0.2289	0.250592366093	1.171917	2120	3197	2339.4717	2896.4275	0.9841887	1.1943068	0.2792	0.165691764461	1.21349378	1534	1900	1718.1783	1699.3598	0.8140088	0.7842612	-0.0537	0.0917492487688	0.96345539	2682	3553	2930.2427	3230.425	1.8021079	1.9172705	0.0894	0.0444304923022	1.063904310	11186	13624	11864.496	12518.266	5.9847457	6.0471774	0.0150	-0.01632107965	1.010431811	12652	15305	13407.334	14066.707	6.6318285	6.859146	0.0486	0.0753108190071	1.034276712	3111	3562	3370.9555	3239.038	1.3255893	1.3237272	-0.0020	-0.114348595037	0.998595213	4641	5962	4967.1666	5464.1909	2.3518137	2.7461472	0.2236	0.0869118641671	1.167672114	3739	4555	4033.7245	4160.8003	2.983102	2.7378545	-0.1238	-0.151759378719	0.917787715	3407	4344	3684.8202	3968.9422	1.4968332	1.5943555	0.0911	0.0560232654992	1.065152416	4473	5613	4792.1219	5140.1129	1.8592979	1.9970457	0.1031	0.0293539345402	1.074085917	1067	1497	1210.1871	1333.8924	0.6935806	0.7487956	0.1105	0.0387623315333	1.079608718	5028	6610	5368.2427	6070.7992	2.3921021	2.7326304	0.1920	0.16838081223	1.142355219	3119	4058	3379.3275	3706.796	1.8786021	2.0937767	0.1564	0.081401261122	1.114539720	1620	1998	1810.3717	1790.8978	0.9365376	0.845833	-0.1470	-0.112919569016	0.903149!sample_table_end
