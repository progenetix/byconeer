Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481477/suppl/GSM481477_DE386.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3381	3151	3402.5432	3098.8014	1.3801487	1.2504651	0.1424	0.105235145435	1.10370832	1845	1419	1840.0554	1451.1752	1.2381212	0.8896509	0.4768	0.434275399693	1.39169323	3633	2788	3655.5101	2750.4686	1.4071303	1.0802814	0.3813	0.232462694931	1.3025594	7307	6302	7332.649	6137.8685	2.7981856	2.4434496	0.1956	0.122114879332	1.14517835	8875	9372	8858.5047	9190.8455	4.3605415	4.7118536	-0.1118	0.00226671205993	0.92544076	9585	10060	9550.9536	9888.8624	3.6630875	3.8819319	-0.0837	-0.0451568073427	0.94362487	1575	1731	1560.1268	1745.5545	0.9612036	1.0121541	-0.0745	-0.113205432654	0.94966128	2179	2169	2182.6809	2157.039	0.7821741	0.8246415	-0.0763	0.0386315714235	0.94850199	1626	1584	1612.7359	1603.6251	1.1183979	0.9772535	0.1946	0.1216317478	1.144429510	16811	13451	16477.5	13340.044	5.3218549	4.6375312	0.1986	0.140809406778	1.14756211	17987	16375	17588.366	16336.989	5.5479846	5.5928721	-0.0116	0.0453052650987	0.991974112	3394	3617	3415.336	3542.0993	1.6530599	1.6680865	-0.0131	-0.0903698862132	0.990991713	3699	4076	3723.2706	3990.1573	1.8274989	1.8999661	-0.0561	0.0372409328908	0.961858714	3100	3178	3126.968	3124.2764	2.2621132	2.0983064	0.1084	0.125931679223	1.078066215	2760	2384	2779.4356	2359.908	1.107638	0.9392904	0.2378	0.236945760098	1.179228416	2511	2488	2520.5345	2458.9692	1.2759701	1.2026477	0.0854	0.182910401266	1.060967517	1039	950	996.168	1012.9971	0.5567503	0.547462	0.0243	-0.0221946538043	1.016966118	4236	4216	4269.5447	4124.4382	1.9356497	1.9084456	0.0204	0.138545953258	1.014254519	1970	2147	1969.3349	2135.874	1.1139758	1.1256095	-0.0150	0.0698092478811	0.989664520	2514	2025	2523.5928	2018.8222	0.8712893	0.6871341	0.3426	0.13304553549	1.2680047!sample_table_end
