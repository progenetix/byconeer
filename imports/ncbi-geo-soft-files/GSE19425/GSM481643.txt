Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481643/suppl/GSM481643_JA799.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1294	2040	1445.5155	1776.3441	1.1264686	1.176058	-0.0622	-0.0554001682778	0.95783412	960	1759	1113.1895	1523.4307	1.2729522	1.1017525	0.2084	0.087909226895	1.15538853	1589	1917	1734.516	1662.5433	0.9632537	1.0180391	-0.0798	0.0404977478582	0.94618534	6863	4979	6214.4736	4447.0735	3.1797108	2.8495821	0.1581	-0.0558819328809	1.11585165	10588	8614	9168.6878	7923.2912	5.3028922	4.9246841	0.1067	-0.0988367231786	1.07679846	6714	5325	6092.9731	4769.9944	3.6661113	3.075232	0.2536	0.307775080119	1.19214137	2386	1633	2477.89	1415.6552	1.4508636	0.8843328	0.7143	0.305808066419	1.64063078	1947	1251	2073.4034	1097.5549	1.0702552	0.7338967	0.5443	0.284120832715	1.45831859	1086	1901	1242.298	1647.8938	1.3840611	1.1247942	0.2992	-0.00317395544287	1.230501610	2582	3344	2652.5658	2921.5062	1.7390114	2.4062061	-0.4685	-0.00202792061929	0.722719211	10159	8301	8830.8803	7619.9799	5.2185058	5.9244643	-0.1830	-0.0772198010155	0.880840112	3056	3160	3058.2483	2761.2889	1.8606329	1.997922	-0.1027	0.0209935354425	0.93128413	935	1975	1088.8418	1716.061	1.0280595	1.6005752	-0.6387	-0.110001809061	0.642306214	3312	6145	3279.7232	5550.647	4.4675986	3.9017134	0.1954	0.299236098913	1.14503515	2310	2931	2408.3517	2559.9916	1.3502763	1.7654086	-0.3867	0.0127075373908	0.764851916	1116	1656	1273.1137	1434.172	0.6985652	0.9340418	-0.4191	-0.0491591088013	0.747894917	543	1186	688.3996	1040.7513	0.7451716	0.7507052	-0.0107	-0.130692472123	0.992628818	1564	3216	1710.1517	2809.8758	1.4081383	1.6833353	-0.2575	0.138911169471	0.836516819	460	1475	603.0738	1278.5135	0.6572587	0.9380194	-0.5132	-0.215248070718	0.700687720	626	698	777.0626	635.1034	0.5133938	0.4684582	0.1321	-0.813706505504	1.0959222!sample_table_end
