Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481617/suppl/GSM481617_EL687.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1812	1908	1921.6268	1798.1635	0.9733853	1.0489401	-0.1078	-0.186602454062	0.92797032	991	957	1038.7939	958.6168	0.6610918	0.6397641	0.0473	-0.0163593817642	1.03333673	1920	1929	2035.0713	1816.3674	0.7797517	0.7997466	-0.0365	-0.0204703844798	0.97499844	16459	11395	16127.898	10295.565	7.0877325	5.408187	0.3902	-0.142407251521	1.31055615	12019	23648	12034.417	21867.375	4.8618324	9.2345269	-0.9255	-0.37213654372	0.52648416	11501	13025	11543.766	11809.711	4.7995147	5.8347062	-0.2818	-0.38555440173	0.82258037	1254	2483	1324.0176	2299.8543	0.8845332	1.1697795	-0.4032	-0.1348259587	0.75615378	1877	2263	1989.393	2105.644	0.750943	0.8795635	-0.2281	-0.238067897412	0.85376789	2989	3194	3172.8592	2930.5306	1.8746743	1.7873708	0.0688	-0.108154756065	1.048844610	13019	15717	12961.367	14339.32	5.3409542	5.8476609	-0.1308	-0.070764012705	0.913348811	3302	7386	3502.0448	6681.1472	1.3477582	2.6510043	-0.9760	-0.889800266888	0.508395312	3851	5374	4061.215	4869.2676	2.7723644	2.7215369	0.0267	-0.208304765971	1.01867613	943	1339	985.755	1294.4123	0.6320268	0.6241434	0.0181	-0.0454052704007	1.012630614	2991	4297	3175.0295	3914.5483	2.268662	2.6910344	-0.2463	-0.198132134546	0.843044515	932	1131	973.528	1107.4377	0.5611168	0.5618575	-0.0019	-0.145561802667	0.998681716	822	1357	848.1542	1310.6087	0.5529832	0.6846211	-0.3081	-0.0353880310632	0.807721417	542	367	497.787	440.3422	0.3235104	0.3043052	0.0883	0.0266282710467	1.063111518	4590	4894	4826.3366	4439.2218	2.2176336	2.2014903	0.0105	-0.0598257606805	1.007332919	1067	1042	1121.5427	1030.3674	0.6621893	0.6716322	-0.0204	0.00727689294788	0.985940220	2710	2498	2874.2683	2313.5362	1.0794448	0.9738732	0.1485	-0.108793818885	1.1084039!sample_table_end
