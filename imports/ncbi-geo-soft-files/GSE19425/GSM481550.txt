Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481550/suppl/GSM481550_EL172.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3249	2678	3030.6833	2793.2733	2.0381861	1.8601069	-0.1319	0.0761206790776	0.91262862	1008	807	964.0649	859.4874	0.54322	0.4719477	-0.2029	-0.110742726072	0.86879673	1837	1542	1736.0302	1620.7342	1.5377212	1.3722683	-0.1642	-0.0277346087187	0.89240374	6871	3265	6282.9805	3387.1647	4.7943436	2.563165	-0.9034	-0.729884029496	0.53462275	12488	15903	11157.158	16454.338	9.1169667	12.197851	0.4200	-0.259386780739	1.33792876	3536	3047	3291.3164	3166.8163	3.4056258	3.2012311	-0.0893	-0.0346966187303	0.93998327	1136	996	1087.3009	1054.0346	0.8325899	0.747039	-0.1564	-0.416583299622	0.89724738	1589	1363	1508.533	1433.6025	0.9410106	0.9146335	-0.0410	-0.0406001123241	0.97196939	6193	4759	5679.9633	4927.1677	2.9513724	2.5013792	-0.2387	-0.167769503876	0.847530810	5041	4358	4648.6588	4504.8269	2.7228454	2.7841366	0.0321	-0.0550791112057	1.0225111	17713	8717	15560.391	9019.4758	9.3290417	5.6236563	-0.7302	-0.581355997124	0.602811712	4580	2713	4235.725	2828.571	2.7148732	1.8414476	-0.5600	-0.377803736652	0.678281213	2652	2175	2486.5979	2282.9983	1.2534839	1.1956515	-0.0681	-0.0304545208133	0.953862714	11023	7566	9897.6935	7830.5116	7.0085338	5.0224283	-0.4807	-0.376376085604	0.716616115	2026	1684	1911.5966	1766.4	1.1207548	1.0811319	-0.0519	-0.0242716859155	0.964646216	2068	1956	1950.2822	2053.8756	1.1396976	1.1904919	0.0629	-0.182731889723	1.044568217	1035	781	990.0176	832.8575	0.5932828	0.4938693	-0.2646	-0.192416655572	0.832434818	2574	2080	2414.2513	2184.2052	1.9412799	1.5969127	-0.2817	-0.13522365054	0.822608119	1655	1396	1568.2754	1468.4765	0.9245662	0.8971568	-0.0434	0.0338754302369	0.970354320	2692	1731	2523.7143	1815.4366	1.3396315	1.0272241	-0.3831	-0.0621863675617	0.766796!sample_table_end
