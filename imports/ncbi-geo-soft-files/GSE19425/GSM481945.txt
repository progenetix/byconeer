Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481945/suppl/GSM481945_MR371.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4485	3865	4124.9299	4144.5512	1.3186279	1.3346382	-0.0174	0.0395929642847	0.9880042	5247	3974	4733.6639	4267.7901	1.5776471	1.4411169	0.1306	0.0547565304684	1.09473923	3979	2483	3706.9091	2582.8949	1.2566181	0.8792211	0.5152	0.0973094171666	1.42924024	12572	8401	10971.107	9044.9295	3.7719846	3.1211238	0.2733	-0.0269828220596	1.20853415	12772	8580	11160.053	9222.9817	3.981075	3.3228262	0.2607	-0.03608452325	1.19809916	6976	4750	6141.8795	5135.2769	2.1918311	1.8417399	0.2511	0.0835923174421	1.19008727	2308	1660	2280.1251	1673.0695	0.7559152	0.5466122	0.4677	0.209991538657	1.38290958	2030	2247	2032.6971	2317.2237	0.6870134	0.8031022	-0.2252	-0.0707702554384	0.85544959	3106	3679	2973.4736	3933.8291	0.930323	1.2537898	-0.4305	-0.163664480918	0.742008810	9773	7652	8449.145	8271.6624	2.8446968	2.8943143	-0.0249	-0.101695060792	0.982856911	20920	18890	19451.064	18926.134	6.7676353	6.7462455	0.0046	-0.0621305322837	1.003170612	12545	8528	10945.617	9171.2851	3.6908061	3.0250938	0.2870	-0.0589060872673	1.220063413	4336	4647	4001.3987	5020.755	1.3932389	1.7676734	-0.3434	-0.187608700301	0.788176614	11688	9964	10159.193	10587.368	3.2954224	3.4897376	-0.0827	-0.157827613779	0.944318115	5215	5423	4708.599	5884.0035	1.4595419	1.8182765	-0.3171	-0.154357439913	0.802706216	2992	3531	2873.0639	3768.1187	0.9427453	1.1872028	-0.3326	-0.148675766529	0.794089517	1399	1201	1448.9888	1195.3628	0.471781	0.4013933	0.2331	0.155305736527	1.175358318	6077	5289	5400.5002	5732.2802	1.6447483	1.7263402	-0.0698	-0.0332001201167	0.952737119	3087	3439	2956.7602	3665.6305	1.0060148	1.3009989	-0.3710	-0.195008234204	0.773263420	1926	1837	1938.0009	1867.3217	0.6355972	0.6404543	-0.0110	-0.0840839562675	0.9924163!sample_table_end
