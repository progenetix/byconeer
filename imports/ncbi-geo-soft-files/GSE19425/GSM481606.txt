Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481606/suppl/GSM481606_EL672.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2687	1815	2539.7365	1951.9923	0.879504	0.7101699	-0.3085	-0.0521526154383	0.80746632	2458	2158	2315.748	2296.1681	1.1117619	1.1117005	-0.0001	0.0756604999649	0.99994473	2623	2034	2477.5001	2171.0397	0.702931	0.6440689	-0.1262	0.160656659349	0.91626194	20403	15256	19347.258	15120.59	5.867578	4.6906957	-0.3230	-0.197123998677	0.79942625	15190	19119	14499.896	18742.905	4.7969692	6.1628498	0.3615	-0.182453229863	1.28473826	11603	9331	11116.661	9385.7411	3.6384034	3.1955131	-0.1873	-0.294736454518	0.87827347	1864	2443	1735.0653	2585.6206	0.7761462	0.9656407	0.3152	-0.0133678623991	1.2441488	2894	2684	2741.0039	2826.7494	0.8132383	0.8313721	0.0318	-0.0288321520622	1.02229839	2166	1709	2025.1162	1844.4556	0.9249214	0.8587614	-0.1071	-0.0127415879261	0.928469510	15693	15526	14973.503	15379.283	5.4960213	5.1223257	-0.1016	-0.00367937640023	0.932006111	7463	4833	7154.6232	4976.8111	2.4274574	1.5817698	-0.6179	-0.650006709241	0.651615812	8907	7832	8551.0728	7930.1174	3.7834763	3.0817371	-0.2960	-0.0774411804133	0.814525213	1933	1703	1800.8132	1838.4171	0.7593611	0.6538853	-0.2157	-0.104402431978	0.861099214	5477	4344	5243.7874	4485.9121	2.7534837	2.332525	-0.2394	-0.195242964095	0.847117815	2076	1766	1937.9103	1902.2283	0.66303	0.6016908	-0.1401	0.0782122190594	0.907486516	1603	1976	1487.0594	2112.8514	0.5998253	0.7311557	0.2856	0.0330929632679	1.218947717	422	663	336.8381	776.8681	0.1578035	0.3735933	1.2433	0.793185156801	2.367458218	5121	3983	4894.9077	4128.2002	1.6449214	1.4266595	-0.2054	-0.00868209795946	0.867311619	1813	1080	1687.3884	1204.6945	0.702128	0.5398963	-0.3791	-0.128181784142	0.768942820	3146	2301	2986.3301	2441.848	0.9797536	0.7843301	-0.3210	0.0700547212415	0.800538!sample_table_end
