Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481531/suppl/GSM481531_DE496.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2642	2305	2595.9856	2342.3315	0.8557214	0.7884383	0.1181	0.132504327738	1.08533712	5174	4483	5054.7217	4544.1612	2.3771604	1.8750076	0.3423	0.329482775464	1.26781383	3295	3337	3228.3893	3379.5338	0.979594	1.0598306	-0.1136	0.00959082595719	0.9242934	18884	13247	17169.957	13434.917	5.4792772	4.4767391	0.2915	0.153657103706	1.22394385	26839	17072	23623.805	17296.753	7.1414768	5.544797	0.3651	0.223723785337	1.287966	8862	7318	8469.0387	7404.0781	2.8322953	2.5315306	0.1620	0.0513365995003	1.11880747	3904	3188	3818.9188	3227.4473	1.5614363	1.2696337	0.2985	0.121610796066	1.22983218	2452	2429	2408.9915	2466.5154	0.8899385	0.9105551	-0.0330	0.0210826829033	0.97735829	2382	2042	2340.0463	2075.8993	1.1207799	0.7923099	0.5004	0.314891501053	1.414572610	13337	8208	12469.854	8312.9825	5.5611866	3.8737991	0.5216	0.420759515229	1.435589811	6690	9692	6486.2639	9818.0564	2.6705287	4.1783555	-0.6458	-0.503866365649	0.639133912	9387	10299	8943.9957	10434.604	3.4526468	3.9219995	-0.1839	-0.012994778605	0.880328213	2003	1789	1977.5932	1822.3647	0.8607474	0.7873898	0.1285	0.152836038187	1.093165514	11905	9926	11213.288	10055.937	4.8336783	3.8648239	0.3227	0.235274515596	1.250685315	2671	2237	2624.2965	2273.8169	0.8630593	0.7607087	0.1821	0.188395100636	1.134546416	2278	2509	2239.0909	2546.4266	0.8116176	0.9028874	-0.1537	0.0808270933241	0.898913417	618	517	633.5593	538.9574	0.2634743	0.2179835	0.2734	0.0975164116205	1.208688918	8538	6387	8176.1601	6451.6113	2.1850824	1.9661394	0.1523	0.0992328489362	1.111356819	1153	1112	1154.2589	1136.1551	0.5432902	0.4929049	0.1404	0.167064862588	1.10222120	1385	1186	1379.5705	1211.0074	0.6027036	0.5545239	0.1202	0.188925618204	1.0868849!sample_table_end
