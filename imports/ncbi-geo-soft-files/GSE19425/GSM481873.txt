Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481873/suppl/GSM481873_MR283.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5740	4785	5593.8398	4896.9014	1.2283733	1.0690076	0.2005	0.0737643063571	1.14907812	4484	5573	4365.9698	5673.2829	1.0806674	1.3161103	-0.2844	-0.359808909199	0.8211073	5248	4524	5108.7188	4631.6926	1.1116432	1.0001741	0.1524	-0.140382464618	1.11144964	10526	12162	10291.639	12170.841	2.2857999	2.7457767	-0.2645	-0.447290650511	0.83247845	17055	19546	16704.819	19484.613	3.8015246	4.3863184	-0.2064	-0.259289250846	0.86667776	10152	10376	9926.3734	10395.906	2.1797856	2.330402	-0.0964	-0.0566820054741	0.93536897	3763	3637	3654.109	3750.0864	0.7859167	0.8198121	-0.0609	-0.0278012917049	0.95865468	2820	3358	2744.8806	3464.5637	0.6336259	0.8079152	-0.3506	-0.265001568404	0.78427289	6421	7019	6260.6584	7108.9655	1.471285	1.5498939	-0.0751	0.00880568375111	0.949281110	12969	12079	12684.406	12089.229	2.798418	2.8885391	-0.0457	0.0061829628116	0.968800411	20972	20149	20560.785	20074.039	4.6186531	4.795507	-0.0542	-0.0610602442603	0.963120912	10649	12761	10410.689	12767.334	2.3754511	2.9419715	-0.3086	-0.331155134415	0.807435113	7575	6891	7400.859	6980.9263	1.7309539	1.7310282	-0.0001	0.0396813909218	0.999957114	11195	14347	10946.233	14343.888	3.0583891	3.5332806	-0.2082	-0.22013427746	0.865594715	5170	4887	5031.2425	5002.5786	1.1234914	1.1339274	-0.0133	0.0327799140259	0.990796516	4233	4608	4120.9862	4714.5347	0.8674694	1.0167647	-0.2291	-0.137359417254	0.853166217	2600	2474	2531.3965	2571.5446	0.6065845	0.5909598	0.0376	0.0121537183373	1.026439318	5823	6870	5676.4001	6959.7808	1.5400237	1.6420893	-0.0926	-0.0815544712426	0.93784419	4310	4084	4196.4023	4198.2316	0.9850842	0.9568282	0.0420	0.0423878510551	1.029530820	3292	2515	3199.5684	2613.2353	0.7061569	0.6190619	0.1899	-0.0493059085136	1.1406885!sample_table_end
