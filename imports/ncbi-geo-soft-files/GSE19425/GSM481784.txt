Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481784/suppl/GSM481784_JBH560.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1374	1650	1493.9342	1518.7075	0.9754688	0.9058792	-0.1068	0.154934929211	0.92866032	1224	1987	1338.4805	1826.5179	0.9732189	1.2375191	0.3466	0.322039466646	1.27157323	944	1352	1046.6672	1244.2324	0.7150973	0.7506522	0.0700	0.0729395436128	1.04972034	8334	6137	8099.3291	5801.5101	4.5354435	3.413643	-0.4099	-0.0130307069259	0.75265915	8262	10035	8034.0314	9642.5203	6.1968854	7.3837978	0.2528	0.282960919678	1.19153376	3768	5193	3870.8246	4875.9359	3.1030602	3.3759042	0.1216	0.026772869154	1.08792737	1389	1734	1509.7146	1597.4044	1.2725763	1.2237023	-0.0565	0.0897584633002	0.96159458	1992	1762	2118.9726	1623.3972	0.9668769	0.8208815	-0.2362	-0.031114507819	0.84900319	1710	2032	1833.0512	1867.7206	1.2734031	1.2097017	-0.0740	0.0927398918914	0.949975410	9195	9616	8874.1645	9223.2368	4.1429759	5.0649289	0.2899	0.0879358318967	1.222533911	10520	9256	10047.779	8863.9893	4.6045842	4.9606944	0.1075	0.0273399334036	1.077338212	6097	5951	6057.7289	5619.5479	3.2470455	2.9634281	-0.1319	0.162648966553	0.912653713	2457	2875	2590.7003	2661.5677	1.3120884	1.4584921	0.1526	-0.0135869967348	1.111580614	3449	4916	3562.8502	4607.7696	4.0642972	3.8894424	-0.0634	0.115305903859	0.956977815	2029	2244	2156.5402	2070.4651	0.9920773	1.0383425	0.0658	-0.0399332512435	1.046634616	1248	2112	1363.0592	1943.9993	0.9066564	1.1206775	0.3057	-0.0415781966255	1.236055317	373	570	410.0289	538.6476	0.2854016	0.3519095	0.3022	0.0480406969976	1.233032418	1653	2184	1776.8355	2013.4366	1.5646846	1.5184102	-0.0433	-0.0499218568459	0.970425719	878	1145	978.1649	1049.4438	0.6235622	0.6774793	0.1196	-0.0843255411858	1.086466320	1904	1488	2029.9734	1367.8963	0.8600104	0.6782484	-0.3425	0.0411661486133	0.7886515!sample_table_end
