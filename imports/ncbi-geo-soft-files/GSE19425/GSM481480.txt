Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481480/suppl/GSM481480_DE387.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2863	2358	2557.4233	2611.4951	1.115553	1.0929077	-0.0296	-0.0215279705687	0.97970042	1851	2040	1651.0139	2271.9701	0.9783829	1.1942216	0.2876	0.0903124199823	1.22060763	3308	2420	2963.7064	2675.6848	1.3461116	1.3000466	-0.0502	0.0861932542854	0.96577924	8253	5607	7256.5022	6073.9321	2.8913946	2.6870665	-0.1057	-0.103009033122	0.92933245	18114	13144	15307.32	14555.689	7.3278469	6.9279548	-0.0810	-0.214944690463	0.94542846	7560	5712	6664.773	6186.2267	3.3088585	3.2332146	-0.0334	-0.0761659292713	0.9771397	1190	1345	1053.7004	1520.3226	0.8484472	1.053327	0.3121	0.264212486326	1.24147628	2283	1559	2041.4003	1751.8082	0.6945805	0.6737221	-0.0440	-0.129898680894	0.96996979	1858	1875	1657.5533	2094.7742	0.9563977	1.0636036	0.1533	0.143252342475	1.112093310	10540	7929	9186.6129	8608.0938	3.1386217	3.260408	0.0549	-0.0187487727366	1.038802511	26439	16987	21750.902	18988.706	7.4236445	7.4947205	0.0137	-0.0719078989994	1.009574312	3079	3162	2753.4132	3465.9352	1.6652407	1.9270894	0.2107	0.0663201409874	1.157243713	4501	4250	4019.6772	4620.3456	1.9396836	2.0127664	0.0534	-0.0268746685337	1.037677714	4968	4940	4424.526	5357.4564	2.8651617	3.1013495	0.1143	-0.0982423002953	1.082434415	3519	3670	3155.171	3998.6636	1.5041652	1.7798237	0.2428	0.237032919378	1.183263416	1770	1671	1576.5139	1875.4903	1.023584	1.077199	0.0737	0.0509918344656	1.052379717	1684	1379	1498.7676	1557.0396	0.8144161	0.7514393	-0.1161	0.00163941243204	0.922672518	2831	2201	2528.3469	2443.9774	1.5072921	1.4720871	-0.0341	0.0829714858947	0.976643519	1959	1991	1751.2612	2219.2553	0.9475409	1.0669765	0.1713	0.0599471872689	1.12604820	2520	1245	2253.7478	1414.2869	0.6926558	0.5487712	-0.3359	0.0254533876955	0.7922712!sample_table_end
