Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481872/suppl/GSM481872_MR282.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5986	6231	5932.8958	6175.4928	1.3575623	1.4395823	0.0846	0.0693532383002	1.06041712	6113	5839	6050.1252	5777.1178	1.364184	1.3690389	0.0051	0.182470601175	1.00355883	4299	3569	4330.6428	3492.0397	1.1588162	0.9106472	-0.3477	-0.11026769117	0.78584264	14453	13512	13571.898	13822.208	3.5295616	3.640383	0.0446	0.171480990299	1.0313985	17836	17662	16620.408	18195.358	5.1038762	5.3854729	0.0775	0.106108944948	1.0551736	9126	10573	8813.2374	10737.115	2.796638	3.1095241	0.1530	0.0895367939387	1.11187937	3162	3578	3239.6157	3500.9094	0.8721157	0.9505291	0.1242	0.0527601799939	1.08991178	4053	4193	4101.1087	4108.672	0.88354	0.9740418	0.1407	0.0427631097421	1.10243089	5308	5503	5296.7472	5433.7341	1.0634278	1.1899713	0.1622	0.0717099571196	1.118995810	17143	17036	15994.7	17527.165	3.8983571	4.6389629	0.2509	0.221422274393	1.189978911	20200	17608	18752.399	18138.79	4.0471511	4.4499205	0.1369	0.0609564448409	1.099519212	14321	13052	13452.251	13336.253	3.162192	3.4137191	0.1104	0.0790963889796	1.079541913	4294	5374	4325.9866	5304.7192	1.5746814	1.8642584	0.2435	0.116127437796	1.183895614	7887	11017	7672.292	11197.708	3.3619041	3.5660929	0.0851	0.00941253281927	1.06073615	4736	4403	4751.6109	4321.6322	0.9665253	0.9798641	0.0198	0.0668963914865	1.013800716	3656	3951	3722.7416	3867.5258	0.9162803	0.9912038	0.1134	0.0255981036008	1.081769217	2288	2421	2384.7515	2347.6652	0.5269505	0.5471903	0.0544	0.0102047940815	1.038409218	3725	6053	3789.5033	5994.6215	1.6691292	1.9000055	0.1869	0.0744957087574	1.138321419	5130	4719	5127.9067	4649.1598	1.0028091	1.0151614	0.0177	0.0275140432386	1.012317720	2796	2630	2884.8685	2550.2507	0.7624481	0.6938269	-0.1361	0.023926821132	0.9099988!sample_table_end
