Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481928/suppl/GSM481928_MR352.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4679	3483	4517.0186	3596.4419	1.3526705	1.0601151	-0.3516	0.0749066772169	0.78372012	4655	4978	4493.4136	5056.414	1.2869696	1.4965832	0.2177	-0.0410570391343	1.16287373	4095	3263	3938.7354	3382.6551	1.174289	0.9960318	-0.2375	0.0955303332598	0.84819994	11660	11262	11448.505	11120.817	3.4978444	3.3635004	-0.0565	-0.201215592183	0.96159235	20305	20064	19983.444	19700.327	6.5271012	6.3748761	-0.0340	-0.155313513574	0.9766786	11120	10552	10913.774	10430.316	3.5046136	3.3049452	-0.0846	-0.0240477394846	0.9430277	2659	2413	2524.1271	2539.7874	1.1650479	1.1214551	-0.0550	-0.0192468873901	0.96258288	4016	3186	3861.0729	3309.427	1.1614035	0.9771719	-0.2492	-0.00246258808311	0.84137169	9664	7740	9468.3346	7735.8447	2.4378772	2.077849	-0.2305	0.0238937588561	0.85231910	9441	9225	9247.8014	9152.0108	3.4354309	3.3305009	-0.0448	-0.0821376276525	0.969456511	10483	10143	10281.524	10037.637	3.6181236	3.5053173	-0.0457	-0.0935304711753	0.968821912	5442	6297	5281.1312	6340.114	2.289643	2.6789289	0.2265	-0.200057164162	1.170020413	2394	2313	2269.5209	2440.9341	1.1267239	1.1609885	0.0432	0.0864968287652	1.030410814	13973	13780	13738.572	13586.142	4.4971382	4.4351392	-0.0200	-0.129004653251	0.986213715	2564	2188	2431.2845	2317.3895	0.9497752	0.8617205	-0.1404	0.0260678695846	0.90728916	2351	2324	2229.5438	2451.7535	0.9320019	0.9855009	0.0805	0.00363475991253	1.057402317	2672	1958	2536.8389	2085.8624	0.7541624	0.6308811	-0.2575	0.150233538646	0.836532118	5836	4242	5681.8812	4338.7328	1.8460527	1.348654	-0.4529	0.0261150502933	0.730560919	2418	1907	2292.2102	2033.4136	0.6922397	0.6313399	-0.1329	0.0212225778609	0.912025120	4116	3045	3959.3888	3174.9296	1.180831	0.9628327	-0.2944	-0.0133911460262	0.8153857!sample_table_end
