Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9775!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481628/suppl/GSM481628_JA683.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1000	1082	1026.9858	1088.6824	0.4674639	0.512824	0.1336	-0.119997461102	1.09703432	1220	1504	1247.9931	1484.8529	0.5325512	0.672604	0.3368	0.132437995098	1.26298463	2923	2686	2879.164	2601.6872	1.1877952	1.1297803	-0.0722	-0.016824574622	0.95115744	7121	7612	6686.0998	7397.9587	3.6528111	3.6676436	0.0058	-0.0553572476032	1.00406055	19996	13555	17491.998	13437.147	7.4018581	6.0950916	-0.2802	-0.223830925734	0.82345426	3595	5238	3508.0147	5054.8808	2.3778824	2.4849142	0.0635	-0.00567790583335	1.04501137	1358	1829	1378.4723	1789.3869	0.9564044	0.9024882	-0.0837	0.00206028365764	0.94362618	944	1556	972.7772	1534.1328	0.732187	0.8813627	0.2675	0.0480846528581	1.20373999	3317	2930	3247.612	2830.024	1.5228849	1.170923	-0.3792	-0.293980337046	0.768884710	3474	3753	3394.269	3610.1014	3.9348096	4.1022311	0.0601	0.0440728784749	1.042548811	3637	3583	3547.6842	3446.9714	2.0690197	1.8735026	-0.1432	0.00567190025031	0.905502512	5568	4529	5308.2515	4365.2037	2.4552662	2.3815141	-0.0440	-0.0843150180322	0.969961613	1314	1565	1336.0943	1542.6553	0.8813783	0.8755723	-0.0095	-0.107240157629	0.993412614	15402	7592	13721.053	7377.97	5.7068532	3.3697453	-0.7601	-0.258116645562	0.590473415	513	602	537.6155	633.7998	0.3909947	0.4955376	0.3418	0.0559771916099	1.267376816	3820	3516	3720.4878	3382.9551	1.7277817	1.5312248	-0.1742	-0.142511077639	0.886237417	435	469	449.9185	507.5597	0.2863443	0.2987374	0.0611	0.125232249372	1.043280518	2569	2613	2548.1575	2534.5718	1.031227	1.1837005	0.1989	0.0685764391592	1.147856419	871	815	901.748	834.1277	0.4235875	0.447828	0.0803	-0.00378807588545	1.057226520	2734	2402	2699.273	2339.6178	1.1201698	1.0145733	-0.1428	-0.141374556666	0.9057317!sample_table_end
