Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481534/suppl/GSM481534_EL154.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2670	2455	2874.4232	2256.7287	1.0085633	0.7597666	-0.4087	-0.0789262166286	0.75331572	2904	2705	3116.4708	2486.7271	1.120154	0.8580528	-0.3846	-0.293804549675	0.76601323	3324	3140	3547.4914	2890.8697	1.1941131	0.9625094	-0.3111	-0.0822654918312	0.80604544	11474	10365	11270.636	10021.568	3.978716	3.5169093	-0.1780	-0.276933799351	0.88393075	11810	13675	11574.71	13465.291	4.1218731	4.7083236	0.1919	-0.216000717769	1.14227766	6474	6602	6638.8908	6267.4985	2.4817124	2.2971088	-0.1115	0.00179791994574	0.92561447	1709	2095	1879.6946	1919.3612	0.6123511	0.6460673	0.0773	-0.212895263413	1.05506018	2410	2714	2605.0936	2495.0806	0.896191	0.862136	-0.0559	-0.0809521706162	0.96200029	3745	3938	3974.3206	3654.1264	1.3109503	1.174438	-0.1586	0.0211816343994	0.895867710	8091	8910	8165.251	8558.3093	2.9296228	3.158625	0.1086	0.0683783214557	1.078167811	14340	11201	13821.601	10880.187	4.8787924	3.9743047	-0.2958	-0.235425712283	0.814608212	5390	3690	5582.8877	3415.0722	1.9091465	1.2149351	-0.6520	-0.53315530324	0.63637613	3001	2941	3215.3614	2707.9453	1.0921892	0.9662345	-0.1768	-0.0965946377086	0.884676814	8528	6348	8569.3594	6019.8977	3.2474458	2.2376095	-0.5373	-0.280106731031	0.689036715	2309	2499	2501.9478	2296.9599	0.8237927	0.7856885	-0.0683	-0.0452360756594	0.953745416	2785	3570	2993.8526	3300.0099	0.9517686	1.1017933	0.2112	-0.301606950677	1.157627217	1047	1080	1195.5931	985.8579	0.4372878	0.3474513	-0.3318	-0.0818871249103	0.794559718	3094	2816	3310.7433	2590.163	1.1964331	0.8946675	-0.4193	-0.263624571487	0.74777919	2083	2121	2270.9953	1943.6072	0.818989	0.6924247	-0.2422	0.0108618874631	0.845462720	2855	2582	3066.4548	2373.1243	1.0199141	0.8005186	-0.3494	-0.110096773566	0.7848883!sample_table_end
