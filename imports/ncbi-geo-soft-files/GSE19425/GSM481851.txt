Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481851/suppl/GSM481851_MR245.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5698	6750	5970.0037	6404.4698	1.3702914	1.4854901	-0.1165	-0.102441403272	0.92245072	4481	5231	4704.1286	4977.6276	1.0485389	1.1224611	-0.0983	-0.0700681627395	0.93414273	5218	5561	5468.0119	5291.1583	1.3531015	1.3133257	0.0430	-0.157192829978	1.03028634	6346	5929	6638.5363	5638.1698	1.8494975	1.5838996	0.2237	0.148465469697	1.16768615	12975	11581	13499.223	11002.918	3.5003189	2.8390857	0.3021	0.197197219791	1.23290366	9997	10660	10441.722	10122.645	2.7222984	2.6546246	0.0363	0.0727465509964	1.02549287	4146	4535	4350.3298	4313.9361	0.8886139	0.8621251	0.0437	0.0901042537225	1.03072498	2559	2895	2699.2177	2755.1823	0.7106357	0.73384	-0.0464	0.000998720548724	0.96837969	12064	12674	12570.773	12051.989	2.7100999	2.6263914	0.0453	-0.0256928723186	1.03187210	15666	16713	16233.694	15946.297	4.1338574	4.1863686	-0.0182	0.0078752023304	0.987456611	19077	20458	19657.144	19650.64	5.0464995	5.2114929	-0.0464	-0.0306174372169	0.968340512	6761	8158	7072.9487	7747.0961	1.6140984	1.715357	-0.0878	0.00233325839615	0.940969313	9658	12148	10084.777	11548.083	2.4266535	2.7034217	-0.1558	-0.134517582586	0.89762314	11832	12144	12330.901	11544.24	2.7373481	2.5845771	0.0829	0.068935595705	1.059108715	7034	7758	7356.2111	7366.0744	1.6682039	1.659955	0.0072	-0.0496576825337	1.004969416	6774	8366	7086.4386	7945.8029	1.4860879	1.6119183	-0.1173	-0.0630659792256	0.921937517	4144	4547	4348.2352	4325.2853	0.9594909	0.9703034	-0.0162	-0.0839966830337	0.988856518	6696	7618	7005.4891	7233.4872	1.5866064	1.643642	-0.0510	-0.0293041821864	0.965299319	6788	7622	7100.97	7237.2685	1.6742902	1.7272685	-0.0449	-0.0576667479535	0.969328320	2430	2700	2564.2786	2572.738	0.784817	0.8165685	-0.0572	-0.130816293661	0.9611159!sample_table_end
