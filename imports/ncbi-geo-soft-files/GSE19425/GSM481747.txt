Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481747/suppl/GSM481747_JBH515.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2544	2366	2622.2688	2265.0029	1.0903474	0.9381961	0.2168	0.14984426041	1.16217422	2678	2794	2756.4004	2672.8386	1.2472905	1.077976	0.2105	0.14851597141	1.15706693	2305	1964	2380.188	1875.7094	0.9901963	0.8277911	0.2584	0.186136668631	1.1961914	9733	7568	9507.6682	7325.4778	4.1554893	3.3801962	0.2979	0.0433169247083	1.22936335	11868	11329	11505.233	10999.351	5.1221516	5.3486066	-0.0624	-0.00494060603308	0.95766096	6719	6894	6649.0287	6667.92	2.9143723	3.1335502	-0.1046	-0.158661742168	0.93005447	1418	1530	1494.5284	1457.9946	0.8667747	0.9127295	-0.0745	-0.0168647146782	0.94965128	1882	1846	1960.4985	1759.7744	0.8659916	0.8308128	0.0598	-0.00323884765964	1.04234279	3221	3866	3293.2253	3712.3325	1.4565067	1.4101706	0.0466	0.00424810286474	1.032858510	5477	6345	5480.4108	6131.8541	3.0499842	3.373746	-0.1455	-0.0630480742787	0.904034911	7807	8797	7686.5731	8530.5714	3.9444048	4.4982229	-0.1895	-0.209626868255	0.876880612	3528	3042	3591.109	2913.0652	2.2579129	1.9385432	0.2200	0.040017362722	1.164747213	1128	1570	1203.2087	1495.739	0.8299957	0.9605838	-0.2108	-0.0353134564085	0.864053414	9168	9281	8971.1013	9006.7801	4.0549908	3.6169496	0.1649	-0.0138560963576	1.121107915	1488	1764	1566.0313	1678.6297	0.8377383	0.9474406	-0.1775	-0.0098828064201	0.884211916	1175	1672	1250.8444	1591.6138	0.7141069	0.9877116	-0.4679	-0.0580304943569	0.722991317	921	1116	991.55588	1068.6007	0.4308487	0.4394411	-0.0285	0.119398676981	0.980446918	3764	4337	3818.5109	4168.1318	1.5030283	1.6988266	-0.1767	-0.152658354018	0.884744919	1247	1747	1322.4742	1662.5521	0.6262013	0.7088121	-0.1788	0.00683169541463	0.883451720	1191	1185	1266.7862	1135.3769	0.7063914	0.5762771	0.2937	0.032612785606	1.2257841!sample_table_end
