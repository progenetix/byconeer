Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481580/suppl/GSM481580_EL642.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	3442	3235	3462.1096	3172.6111	1.1970335	1.0523829	-0.1858	0.0304777627844	0.87915912	5509	4804	5466.698	4684.654	2.0091631	1.6106781	-0.3189	-0.135992698202	0.80166613	1155	925	1140.7205	968.6895	0.5425214	0.4578622	-0.2448	-0.306554722075	0.84395244	13249	11216	12608.738	11157.382	4.8099174	4.0792532	-0.2377	-0.20700090991	0.84809215	7905	12855	7719.1895	12842.705	3.8579384	6.1748642	0.6786	0.0208937178729	1.60056066	9612	11075	9313.7664	11011.652	4.792978	5.5912756	0.2223	0.348251685266	1.16655567	1291	1996	1278.4714	1988.7452	0.7860616	1.1889273	0.5969	0.0814845714776	1.51251158	2585	2402	2597.329	2375.657	1.0040611	0.8911151	-0.1722	-0.0294880693101	0.88751089	4707	4343	4690.8369	4227.9802	1.6860105	1.4339067	-0.2337	-0.0193602169557	0.850473110	12260	11817	11716.243	11775.017	5.3090087	5.2607458	-0.0132	-0.101994564094	0.990909211	8393	6226	8178.7882	6099.7405	3.4022667	2.4928105	-0.4487	-0.299785786058	0.73269112	4172	3552	4177.7067	3477.0226	2.2755873	1.8773508	-0.2775	-0.306927750775	0.824996113	1284	1156	1271.5836	1187.9956	0.6366381	0.5879186	-0.1149	-0.0593825900253	0.923473714	4258	3778	4261.5065	3689.8523	1.7559547	1.415274	-0.3112	-0.280930069139	0.805985415	1062	842	1045.2343	889.6845	0.5082303	0.4346615	-0.2256	-0.181055290786	0.855245116	953	853	937.2959	900.2563	0.4611117	0.4349229	-0.0844	-0.379705611194	0.94320517	397	379	345.8102	434.9427	0.1261373	0.1515047	0.2644	0.191971272202	1.201109318	4339	4546	4339.4901	4428.3928	2.0570959	2.0003556	-0.0404	-0.017879519715	0.972417219	1302	1351	1289.2945	1372.1131	0.5345526	0.5339605	-0.0016	-0.00932881403838	0.998892220	1709	1420	1708.1908	1437.0965	1.0318143	0.854283	-0.2724	-0.0823925730506	0.8279425!sample_table_end
