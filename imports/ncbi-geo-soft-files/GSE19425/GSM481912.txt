Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481912/suppl/GSM481912_MR326.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	6155	3907	5896.7608	4080.1908	1.5735471	1.0603046	-0.5695	0.0233565680918	0.67383082	4071	3789	3882.8813	3962.0858	1.4118024	1.382562	-0.0302	0.0200747255543	0.97928853	4001	3085	3816.5231	3255.5101	0.9332577	0.7888182	-0.2426	0.00576688508902	0.84523094	21290	18341	19756.055	19018.138	4.1080441	4.0102504	-0.0348	-0.114167090363	0.97619455	23013	21832	21258.799	22737.931	5.640676	5.7160501	0.0192	-0.211664453713	1.01336266	11404	12626	10818.902	12981.358	2.900547	3.3887508	0.2244	0.214851442143	1.16831437	2894	3836	2745.7132	4009.2216	0.8209224	1.1054916	0.4294	0.207241055939	1.34664578	6055	4605	5799.2311	4774.5273	1.0257242	0.9006025	-0.1877	-0.0368025744745	0.87801639	3096	2526	2939.6781	2690.64	1.0065906	0.8770731	-0.1987	-0.0606172209005	0.871330410	18881	14723	17602.931	15182.188	3.4916815	3.2343311	-0.1105	-0.197560865365	0.926296111	20044	13930	18651.77	14342.944	3.5854143	3.0222383	-0.2465	-0.216858765617	0.842925812	15090	16823	14180.888	17390.336	2.9882142	3.7959695	0.3452	-0.259422544503	1.270313613	6765	6172	6489.3947	6351.6004	1.3916684	1.3795546	-0.0126	-0.046894816807	0.991295514	8627	8877	8225.8002	9113.4185	3.7713051	3.7182524	-0.0204	-0.251284205306	0.985932515	5291	4427	5053.5023	4597.4369	0.9339036	0.8827525	-0.0813	-0.0903566924173	0.945228716	3243	3266	3081.3233	3439.1565	0.693151	0.777615	0.1659	-0.155625017597	1.121855217	1088	742	1042.101	827.6057	0.3785669	0.2916449	-0.3763	0.122485338501	0.770392118	5244	5383	5007.5953	5565.0481	1.6497531	1.6258644	-0.0210	0.109373398163	0.985519819	2546	1834	2415.0113	1975.0799	0.7820598	0.630367	-0.3111	-0.0967979971489	0.806034320	4645	3541	4432.0559	3714.0252	0.7514648	0.6977436	-0.1070	-0.170147599408	0.9285113!sample_table_end
