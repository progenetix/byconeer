Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481548/suppl/GSM481548_EL170.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4355	4107	4207.0571	4183.8548	1.230704	1.2494901	0.0219	0.11937052091	1.01526452	5776	4178	5455.8596	4260.2874	1.4376281	1.2755491	-0.1726	0.0372160477035	0.88725943	3814	3671	3704.7603	3734.7253	1.2549959	1.1172402	-0.1677	0.00312768826266	0.89023414	11954	8418	10852.486	8611.9777	3.3866374	2.640013	-0.3593	-0.146434519659	0.77953815	13765	12807	12480.919	13063.635	4.8399008	4.1760961	-0.2128	-0.158877794858	0.86284746	6506	6482	6094.9374	6627.5295	2.2356062	2.1278084	-0.0713	-0.123772275617	0.95178147	1669	1984	1727.351	1996.1625	0.7253654	0.6547932	-0.1477	-0.166612399573	0.9027088	2463	2143	2462.4681	2159.1084	0.7160998	0.6344902	-0.1746	-0.043731926454	0.88603599	6207	5746	5829.0342	5877.0719	1.4044459	1.6796396	0.2582	0.0153427011586	1.195944710	14005	13598	12694.451	13855.625	3.6161405	4.3076286	0.2524	0.097636818835	1.191222611	21843	16974	19792.98	17266.839	5.5501442	5.3494476	-0.0531	-0.112236930328	0.963839312	9617	7594	8805.4075	7783.0564	3.0033883	2.4486293	-0.2946	-0.232148110459	0.815288913	5508	5561	5222.0688	5689.4452	1.6985938	1.8510201	0.1240	-0.0117102449524	1.089736714	11110	10738	10104.06	10955.894	3.2448125	3.2791589	0.0152	0.0154805846584	1.01058515	3759	4524	3653.4887	4630.584	1.1184779	1.3751781	0.2981	0.15084870652	1.229508516	3394	4293	3316.6908	4385.5831	1.1439184	1.3497237	0.2387	-0.0304451200844	1.179912517	1874	2111	1917.154	2126.9648	0.5113448	0.6299473	0.3009	0.147647043475	1.231942118	4952	5767	4727.4427	5898.0882	1.7103257	1.778028	0.0560	0.0539077623619	1.039584419	4199	3627	4064.4	3690.2816	1.0426528	1.1626046	0.1571	0.0182604207163	1.115044820	3298	2566	3229.9876	2591.5726	0.7935722	0.7745527	-0.0350	0.05185289674	0.9760331!sample_table_end
