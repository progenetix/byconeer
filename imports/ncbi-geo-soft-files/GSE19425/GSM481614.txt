Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481614/suppl/GSM481614_EL682.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1919	1881	2011.1184	1786.4192	1.0258312	0.9081457	-0.1758	-0.0695656356096	0.88527792	1539	1502	1621.6882	1439.4845	1.0510534	0.8723139	-0.2689	-0.178882917795	0.82994253	869	838	916.2189	819.9116	0.4386245	0.3974095	-0.1424	0.0506999172669	0.90603584	10886	7696	10948.948	7201.673	5.5137918	3.7551808	-0.5542	-0.342752040416	0.68105235	9132	13500	9261.2872	12789.22	4.856728	6.7700159	0.4792	-0.184162057314	1.39394586	11160	8997	11208.338	8428.4539	5.9142802	4.5341116	-0.3834	-0.326016275939	0.76663797	2221	2771	2334.0097	2601.5694	1.3003375	1.3421688	0.0457	-0.188310074573	1.03216958	1480	1330	1557.8966	1279.3392	0.7573701	0.6390149	-0.2451	-0.230724734799	0.84372879	3810	2838	3977.0353	2664.576	2.5908227	1.5967708	-0.6983	-0.409541541073	0.61631810	10742	11979	10812.466	11295.966	5.4300734	5.5337308	0.0273	-0.0821956019317	1.019089511	5950	5998	6124.4669	5602.3177	2.8505468	2.6961883	-0.0803	-0.00728336218775	0.945849512	4603	4329	4782.735	4052.0887	2.5130161	2.0848861	-0.2695	-0.208236012579	0.829634913	648	741	683.0072	729.5179	0.3451387	0.3772372	0.1283	0.136479765198	1.093001714	3459	3459	3612.6982	3237.7347	2.272341	1.9910095	-0.1907	-0.19065535014	0.876193115	698	767	735.7751	753.6334	0.3685018	0.3702057	0.0067	0.0523705396693	1.004623716	1006	1160	1057.8109	1121.6379	0.501906	0.5176554	0.0446	-0.0124386297478	1.031379117	245	286	232.7781	301.1248	0.145988	0.179176	0.2955	0.303575498338	1.227333918	3385	3696	3535.2149	3458.0344	1.7744527	1.7373134	-0.0305	-0.0462034850835	0.9790719	436	462	455.0176	465.3753	0.2965333	0.2864467	-0.0499	0.00686787912416	0.965984920	1780	1470	1864.1181	1410.4158	0.8998012	0.6789399	-0.4063	-0.188762318575	0.7545443!sample_table_end
