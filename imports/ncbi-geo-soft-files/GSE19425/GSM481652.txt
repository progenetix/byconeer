Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481652/suppl/GSM481652_JA806.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2202	1341	2175.6006	1356.4063	1.2333368	0.8314105	-0.5689	-0.27288698372	0.67411472	2151	1183	2126.5521	1203.4819	1.2771622	0.7547285	-0.7589	-0.603619563096	0.59094173	1657	1247	1669.3711	1264.9169	0.9472562	0.764424	-0.3094	-0.19532078089	0.80698754	7151	2798	6412.5066	2764.2188	3.7276376	1.6565905	-1.1700	-0.91707359914	0.44440765	13040	4975	11102.04	4893.8715	6.3067297	2.8210905	-1.1606	-0.880303221122	0.44731436	6568	5008	5934.5708	4926.3126	3.5701731	3.145398	-0.1828	0.000779133436089	0.88102117	2218	2276	2190.8288	2260.9359	1.0051233	1.0389384	0.0477	0.221349388068	1.03364278	1957	1590	1938.5767	1585.7202	1.0062125	0.7322647	-0.4585	-0.372924974707	0.72774359	2033	1354	2012.2129	1369.0193	1.1524991	0.8204515	-0.4903	-0.440708939724	0.71188910	5171	4717	4776.8364	4640.6946	2.3994033	2.0284665	-0.2423	-0.307687882856	0.845404511	10815	6487	9350.0055	6434.0998	4.5482758	2.8137761	-0.6928	-0.381441806395	0.618646712	6506	4009	5883.4087	3948.0921	2.5508644	1.5005668	-0.7655	-0.712381185097	0.588258113	2617	2377	2554.43	2356.2885	1.0705516	0.8335306	-0.3610	-0.483650045357	0.778599114	7217	3433	6466.2406	3386.5187	4.0331854	1.975445	-1.0297	-0.863571579619	0.489797715	2519	3190	2468.0684	3145.9319	1.1492314	1.1362787	-0.0164	-0.143379910969	0.988729216	1942	1689	1924.0363	1679.9357	0.7632435	0.6367022	-0.2615	-0.457464206782	0.834205817	1154	951	1180.5342	983.2266	0.7009424	0.6157358	-0.1870	-0.0899400517144	0.878439918	2820	2111	2735.3712	2093.3054	1.472735	0.9636907	-0.6119	-0.514449662811	0.654354419	1384	1390	1403.0399	1403.2126	0.894102	0.9109745	0.0270	-0.141027026508	1.018870820	1074	674	1103.9922	718.0533	0.5246107	0.3574892	-0.5533	-0.336424841129	0.6814372!sample_table_end
