Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481668/suppl/GSM481668_JA918.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	2355	1790	2266.697	1846.6486	1.3631542	1.0937669	-0.3176	-0.12812579506	0.80237952	1098	1102	1088.4706	1131.197	0.7774246	0.7750181	-0.0045	0.0756952717464	0.99690463	2890	2304	2745.9253	2381.8377	1.33327	1.1446244	-0.2201	-0.113631938328	0.85850914	5201	3241	4842.3531	3364.2047	2.4261694	1.6649153	-0.5432	-0.431239150954	0.68623215	8443	4914	7781.0823	5138.8679	3.795129	2.4741239	-0.6172	-0.477135041515	0.65192096	6036	5677	5591.877	5944.3304	2.8947064	3.0316033	0.0667	0.16580365639	1.04729217	2141	2816	2066.9406	2925.5559	0.8554909	1.2141733	0.5051	0.601724847216	1.41927088	2118	1865	2045.3748	1922.977	0.9082081	0.8579443	-0.0821	-0.0310349944942	0.94465619	1776	1655	1726.9013	1707.5288	1.1710276	1.1046261	-0.0842	-0.0373025213088	0.943296410	6948	6468	6418.9861	6781.7082	2.7524181	2.9471252	0.0986	-0.195050480124	1.070740411	18907	11514	17496.086	12119.993	7.7820359	5.6011216	-0.4744	-0.224757724547	0.719750212	4659	3486	4350.3505	3624.459	1.8797965	1.6106085	-0.2230	-0.231968768908	0.856799413	4857	4325	4531.1961	4514.4863	1.8465468	1.8106532	-0.0283	-0.167799145115	0.980561814	4220	3449	3945.3106	3585.5002	2.9629407	2.508822	-0.2400	-0.232662536356	0.846733815	4724	4311	4409.7696	4499.4642	1.7999526	1.8669207	0.0527	0.0266863386294	1.037205516	3005	2830	2848.0248	2939.9347	1.1595144	1.2174133	0.0703	-0.144073734844	1.049933817	1206	1043	1189.2675	1071.941	0.8003251	0.697315	-0.1988	-0.0881531177294	0.871289718	2615	2983	2502.6315	3096.0395	1.3934173	1.6319645	0.2280	0.0663136649549	1.171195819	2178	1999	2101.6798	2063.0354	1.3971797	1.3350029	-0.0657	-0.101880901889	0.955498320	1184	978	1168.5534	1006.4083	0.5428612	0.4679036	-0.2144	-0.139719864625	0.8619213!sample_table_end
