Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481687/suppl/GSM481687_JA953.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4349	3918	4469.8169	3797.14	1.3471551	1.1383156	0.2430	-0.0450748194577	1.18346362	3070	3420	3137.2224	3325.962	1.0286638	1.0846354	-0.0764	0.0330918352844	0.94839593	3111	2889	3179.6262	2822.4368	1.1031182	0.9633911	0.1954	-0.0369129105347	1.14503674	7055	7995	7273.2549	7688.9486	3.1756349	3.3615729	-0.0821	-0.113003757236	0.94468725	13027	15997	13365.856	15434.146	5.6662566	6.3650471	-0.1678	-0.0724205265941	0.89021446	9408	9052	9674.741	8709.9039	3.2328602	2.8928753	0.1603	0.0659389700909	1.11752497	1081	944	1060.5791	972.5068	1.1928736	1.1214579	0.0891	0.192996169158	1.06368118	1903	1863	1920.501	1848.8548	0.9853815	0.963036	0.0331	0.0408227308407	1.02320319	4318	4689	4437.516	4526.4581	1.3553446	1.3855362	-0.0318	0.0771882985574	0.978209410	4640	4701	4774.7687	4537.7216	2.3917227	2.3360853	0.0340	0.0688650369609	1.023816511	10156	9127	10441.762	8782.7802	5.3539444	4.6332776	0.2086	-0.0563472665817	1.155541412	1456	1424	1450.98	1431.7791	1.5532261	1.540431	0.0119	-0.0669617110514	1.008306113	1211	1286	1196.1588	1300.3332	1.4040612	1.5547186	-0.1470	0.119317261933	0.903096714	8585	10110	8841.3126	9735.3641	2.9880306	3.3483491	-0.1643	0.0691395502132	0.892389215	1513	1412	1510.6767	1420.3111	1.3913393	1.2977571	0.1005	0.104575657679	1.072110716	773	843	738.1503	876.2931	0.8234485	1.0023184	-0.2836	-0.0863625738655	0.821543817	1889	1793	1905.8563	1783.4505	0.6130696	0.5765997	0.0885	0.00968383348705	1.063249918	4076	3985	4185.6667	3860.7452	1.4246201	1.3685385	0.0579	0.00986983056072	1.040979219	3363	3148	3441.7387	3068.5289	1.1174712	1.0037564	0.1548	0.0302634650135	1.113289220	1334	978	1323.0476	1005.3559	0.5065202	0.3973404	0.3502	0.279580050842	1.2747766!sample_table_end
