Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481955/suppl/GSM481955_MR381.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	8573	6908	8307.5299	6822.7715	1.6247466	1.3464053	0.2711	0.183849548355	1.20672922	7682	5856	7523.0211	5747.3828	1.4010834	1.0918428	0.3598	0.169351784991	1.28322813	5999	4246	6042.2372	4067.2421	1.3597277	0.929696	0.5485	0.113928618949	1.46255084	14318	9860	13449.005	9930.5301	3.3745452	2.4816016	0.4434	0.0580988106059	1.35982555	17604	12587	16601.145	12630.834	3.9786675	3.0551407	0.3810	0.0240651636388	1.30228616	9767	8041	9368.4816	8005.7325	2.1899897	1.9010856	0.2041	0.0601089650216	1.15196797	3338	2782	3537.4239	2610.29	0.7778781	0.5688422	0.4515	0.201896031489	1.36747618	2233	2935	2444.2548	2763.8339	0.6419234	0.7445979	-0.2141	-0.0651777134417	0.86210749	7995	8752	7794.5252	8760.0356	1.3518292	1.5514128	-0.1987	-0.047753415479	0.871353610	12239	11333	11552.489	11401.609	3.3026257	3.3881377	-0.0369	-0.107661219052	0.974761311	26312	22848	25512.943	22349.255	7.2386085	6.6303372	0.1266	-0.00109895859301	1.091740612	15214	11260	14297.917	11330.816	3.2789391	2.5600779	0.3570	-0.0238634590396	1.280796513	9332	11251	8984.5007	11322.088	2.1034853	2.6397179	-0.3276	-0.179705111865	0.796859814	21802	16024	20852.269	15960.811	3.9590312	3.147912	0.3308	0.0488760478131	1.257668915	8034	8058	7828.279	8023.7864	1.7611021	1.7845926	-0.0191	-0.00538751955705	0.98683716	5743	6549	5801.9196	6458.3705	1.2685825	1.3761881	-0.1175	-0.0410926934667	0.921808917	3682	3458	3864.3588	3281.5221	0.7073003	0.6300259	0.1669	0.122211115081	1.122652618	9094	8894	8773.2536	8911.6927	1.7365233	1.7204238	0.0134	0.00844371790429	1.009357819	7547	7563	7407.1433	7499.4682	1.4425347	1.5326336	-0.0874	-0.0532275249765	0.94121320	2560	2415	2769.7233	2253.6521	0.7919674	0.6668836	0.2480	0.0454105377174	1.1875647!sample_table_end
