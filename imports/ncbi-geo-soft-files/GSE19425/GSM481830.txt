Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481830/suppl/GSM481830_MR108.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4693	5358	4640.1502	5403.9933	1.1161056	1.1757259	0.0751	0.0137438035261	1.05341812	5339	6004	5261.0086	6044.2543	1.435223	1.3443632	-0.0944	-0.122861188728	0.93669283	5107	4709	5040.1846	4757.9411	1.1490237	1.0917247	-0.0738	-0.00822233762736	0.95013244	12048	10089	11569.7	10097.201	2.7686944	2.4554944	-0.1732	-0.091425827134	0.88687815	15904	14139	15113.886	14213.328	3.9130824	3.616572	-0.1137	-0.00286363229043	0.92422586	11308	9493	10871.744	9514.9429	2.6577157	2.2884754	-0.2158	-0.121467668916	0.86106857	3941	3361	3898.1306	3402.3453	0.8857909	0.8224873	-0.1070	0.00475895098198	0.92853438	3314	3001	3299.5725	3049.3249	0.8078196	0.7447932	-0.1172	-0.0735597915564	0.92197969	9225	10109	8927.4465	10117.029	2.3208652	2.1222713	-0.1291	-0.0224969569212	0.91443110	16534	15718	15694.596	15834.912	3.7900776	3.8366597	0.0176	-0.0515343834728	1.012290511	18211	17798	17215.966	18008.587	4.4850605	4.6514886	0.0526	-0.0213718609905	1.037107212	11264	10606	10830.009	10611.214	2.3394965	2.564834	0.1327	-0.0707506333457	1.096318813	7973	6567	7762.5232	6605.2367	1.6980447	1.8085437	0.0910	0.00221989732185	1.065074214	9622	10512	9298.7586	10516.584	2.5926483	2.3424441	-0.1464	-0.0780218386338	0.903494715	5651	5166	5551.0652	5209.7127	1.197292	1.2008641	0.0043	-0.0160841836066	1.002983516	6173	5812	6040.2841	5854.8796	1.259493	1.3475403	0.0975	-0.0298016693992	1.069906917	2487	2942	2483.17	2991.6435	0.6592909	0.6625449	0.0071	0.0506162030122	1.004935618	6615	6532	6464.8779	6570.4435	1.5183211	1.4277174	-0.0888	-0.169293275412	0.940326319	4499	5427	4451.4737	5473.9443	1.1417012	1.2270941	0.1041	0.0510294340091	1.074794420	4074	3843	4029.0225	3882.4296	0.8463311	0.8283082	-0.0311	0.0140238635743	0.9787046!sample_table_end
