Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481541/suppl/GSM481541_EL161.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1153	954	1113.4167	982.6913	1.2928037	1.1478986	0.1715	-0.0438078744729	1.1262352	766	703	725.7557	740.3153	0.9630661	1.0064109	-0.0635	-0.086593740461	0.95693133	1123	778	1082.6499	813.8779	1.0980824	0.823893	0.4145	0.0729565509637	1.33279734	4161	5447	4235.006	5087.2781	3.63433	4.4336305	-0.2868	-0.294554328741	0.81971875	5623	9819	5766.8298	8995.3204	6.6928038	10.502362	-0.6500	-0.301639402196	0.63726656	2465	2739	2461.0208	2643.864	2.8046343	3.0238311	-0.1086	-0.209060836015	0.92751027	965	1269	923.0452	1284.2931	0.9567433	1.2466643	-0.3819	-0.118064594421	0.76744268	877	996	836.8132	1023.6549	0.7010042	0.8623771	-0.2989	-0.248223487442	0.81287439	1195	1500	1156.5888	1503.0323	1.489673	1.9428204	-0.3832	-0.225344556027	0.766757910	1498	1629	1462.6852	1621.8707	1.6646627	1.8422211	-0.1462	0.0231981402334	0.903617211	2786	4361	2796.6412	4111.2001	2.9709585	4.4171502	-0.5722	-0.636063367622	0.672596212	1848	1709	1822.2422	1695.2249	1.6027621	1.5489497	0.0493	-0.163261764271	1.034741213	1025	943	982.9711	972.2105	1.4566449	1.3842289	0.0736	-0.00322548725875	1.05231514	1523	1692	1488.4378	1679.5633	2.6823473	3.1057766	-0.2115	-0.270410216981	0.863663915	1206	1081	1167.8098	1106.4871	1.0598744	1.013907	0.0640	-0.00206737658185	1.045336916	1088	963	1047.2148	991.3928	0.8625241	0.8408428	0.0367	0.0524714027574	1.025785217	620	446	585.0704	483.5927	0.7699786	0.6481323	0.2485	0.0877501296047	1.18799618	933	771	891.681	806.8741	1.2763948	1.1856809	0.1064	-0.140310417421	1.076507819	751	559	711.5528	602.1936	0.9030956	0.7729331	0.2245	-0.0257586825948	1.168400820	1002	748	959.6156	783.8412	1.0060601	0.8255079	0.2854	0.0123894606986	1.2187165!sample_table_end
