Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481887/suppl/GSM481887_MR301.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	5620	4782	5200.6434	4925.2228	1.8530968	1.7669978	0.0686	0.082617578166	1.04872622	2022	2362	2061.2144	2357.5023	0.7459534	0.810772	-0.1202	-0.0706425423699	0.92005323	4773	3262	4475.729	3302.6136	1.6740305	1.2219977	0.4541	0.0667273836979	1.36991294	6246	5353	5713.0478	5523.0308	1.9545725	2.0581811	-0.0745	-0.200870342328	0.94966015	13556	12533	11894.62	13012.258	4.7347019	4.8066544	-0.0218	-0.177337912162	0.98503066	5026	6355	4691.235	6566.5346	1.8015494	2.4934845	-0.4689	-0.276403782604	0.72250287	2030	2285	2068.5024	2274.5304	0.9579773	0.880555	0.1216	0.0369273762824	1.08792448	1844	1673	1899.1495	1667.0205	0.5768346	0.5642556	0.0318	0.0577569054385	1.02229329	5533	6351	5129.0952	6562.2651	1.7905274	2.1531358	-0.2661	-0.0814459952191	0.831590510	6741	7416	6120.8059	7699.5591	1.6826258	2.5062083	-0.5748	-0.376617631735	0.671383111	30575	19520	26550.904	20337.316	7.7395991	7.0405805	0.1366	0.00386815735176	1.099284212	8446	6134	7534.6312	6330.7671	2.7439359	2.2615876	0.2789	-0.0629287136449	1.213278613	7800	8481	7005.8231	8818.5173	2.3992866	2.9685475	-0.3072	-0.169479935562	0.808235914	7800	8783	7005.8231	9138.4052	3.4753734	3.3886181	0.0365	-0.0982645392442	1.02560215	5362	5616	4982.1535	5788.059	1.536879	1.9337077	-0.3314	-0.161512502685	0.794783516	2892	4006	2867.9173	4087.6336	1.0623207	1.4197823	-0.4185	-0.191587698008	0.748227917	2714	3039	2710.0677	3072.11	0.9705742	1.0819372	-0.1567	-0.0395978380376	0.897070718	2297	4428	2329.2034	4538.8989	1.4092905	1.6389794	-0.2178	-0.107189481875	0.859858619	3547	4156	3437.8711	4247.8122	1.2659586	1.5733428	-0.3136	-0.166325518837	0.804629920	2653	1930	2654.8321	1923.3007	0.6467722	0.5895093	0.1337	-0.0117210515783	1.0971366!sample_table_end
