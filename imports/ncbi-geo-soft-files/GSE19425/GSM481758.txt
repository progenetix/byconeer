Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481758/suppl/GSM481758_JBH528.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	1461	1316	1405.3526	1363.1905	1.0661634	0.9103714	-0.2279	-0.0470727320909	0.8538762	1046	1179	979.8763	1230.349	0.9454997	1.0053359	0.0885	0.0566125206965	1.06328523	1528	1270	1473.6174	1318.552	0.9575627	0.8151703	-0.2323	-0.00229851397737	0.8512974	9231	6591	9152.3687	6297.834	5.4303729	3.8128687	-0.5102	-0.141096977665	0.70213755	9908	10542	9819.976	9934.1296	7.3277051	7.2673773	-0.0119	-0.195162161964	0.99176726	5492	5401	5441.7825	5199.0813	4.0259546	3.6223324	-0.1524	-0.126974298954	0.8997457	1306	1152	1249.325	1204.7284	1.2191163	1.1256571	-0.1151	-0.0796762072174	0.92333868	1866	1598	1818.9329	1631.7347	0.9553438	0.9458813	-0.0144	-0.141379298535	0.99009529	1439	1505	1383.6181	1543.4073	1.2594737	1.1630902	-0.1149	-0.191561056783	0.923473210	8069	6272	8013.0654	6002.4073	4.2017905	3.815804	-0.1390	-0.0600525934315	0.908137611	7356	5960	7300.5867	5714.421	3.7752732	3.5132127	-0.1038	-0.0219862638861	0.93058512	4908	3331	4865.3824	3260.5405	3.7042101	2.732347	-0.4390	-0.0636009694067	0.737632813	1429	1120	1373.7413	1174.2917	1.0900468	0.9630981	-0.1786	-0.187614171663	0.883538414	3497	4328	3469.3745	4197.6111	3.9093193	3.792935	-0.0436	-0.0876198465727	0.97022915	1326	932	1269.9209	995.5625	0.806653	0.7102761	-0.1836	0.0367396315266	0.880522416	981	932	914.7403	995.5625	0.7281025	0.8193412	0.1703	-0.0173776131377	1.125310217	472	300	394.2916	382.0237	0.3656918	0.3102472	-0.2372	-0.251638299212	0.848384318	1446	1560	1390.5331	1595.5895	1.376435	1.2300356	-0.1622	-0.145884408592	0.893638719	702	647	635.1034	724.6001	0.5698755	0.5781692	0.0208	-0.0630934248659	1.014553420	2170	1237	2125.0407	1286.523	1.0497148	0.7165336	-0.5509	-0.113252777802	0.6825984!sample_table_end
