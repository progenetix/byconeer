Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada).!Sample_description = These samples were hybridized to two color-reversal arrays!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9776!Sample_contact_name = Jude,,Kendall!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM481nnn/GSM481835/suppl/GSM481835_MR159.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19425!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = Log2 ratio (tumor/reference) of local-normalized values for each spot (log2 of LOCAL.RATIO)#GMEAN = Log2 geometric mean ratio (tumor/reference) which combines the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	GMEAN	LOCAL.RATIO1	4792	5276	4673.1328	5376.7991	1.3107134	1.5270324	-0.2204	-0.158029392209	0.85834032	3378	3431	3335.4817	3465.8029	0.9647318	1.0497572	-0.1219	-0.195697254751	0.91900473	5087	4439	4958.0041	4500.5843	1.2765525	1.1717118	0.1236	0.0458962580723	1.08947654	12054	12460	11390.98	12892.65	3.1008964	3.6124075	-0.2203	-0.383250805117	0.85840165	16108	16035	15057.863	16653.743	4.4000035	4.7224193	-0.1020	-0.295399570992	0.93172656	10473	9845	9954.5574	10130.004	2.6932393	2.8176974	-0.0652	-0.178315692491	0.95582987	2197	2750	2197.9441	2776.6048	0.5859404	0.764086	-0.3830	-0.279026914094	0.76685148	2360	3205	2353.644	3237.4198	0.708323	1.0026023	-0.5013	-0.40451723056	0.70648459	5220	4733	5086.7396	4804.1152	1.3524565	1.3371129	0.0165	-0.0821894622903	1.011475110	11601	13585	10982.172	14094.934	3.4002488	4.5807673	-0.4299	-0.37274210282	0.74228811	14078	14762	13228.936	15332.42	4.1208284	4.9375187	-0.2609	-0.213806093248	0.83459512	9922	11255	9457.2346	11619.768	2.8337868	3.6162874	-0.3518	-0.200114126243	0.783617613	4333	5325	4234.0812	5428.0317	1.368453	1.8255078	-0.4158	-0.225571302393	0.749628614	11838	12153	11195.668	12567.141	3.3910405	3.9517409	-0.2208	-0.208346686313	0.85811315	2849	2816	2828.7572	2845.3575	0.852636	0.8971712	-0.0735	-0.058878390556	0.950360416	2804	3825	2785.7647	3874.2075	0.8353108	1.2021195	-0.5252	-0.229042100103	0.69486517	1201	990	1229.28	1001.9766	0.3614779	0.3032061	0.2536	0.111954742369	1.192185318	8052	9084	7743.5949	9333.7375	1.5530799	1.8282734	-0.2353	-0.218024778375	0.84947919	2687	2705	2673.6493	2729.02	0.8277684	0.8472684	-0.0336	-0.0472562148371	0.976984820	2411	2838	2403.3121	2868.0459	0.7925127	0.9459005	-0.2553	-0.243705080004	0.8378394!sample_table_end
