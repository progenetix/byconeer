(20) In short, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded FFPE tissue of uterine corpus cancer was used. Cases were discarded if the tumor cell percentage was below 70%.  Genomic DNA was isolated from 10*10Âµm thick paraffin slides. Slides were deparaffinized twice in xylene for 5 minutes, rehydrated in 100% (twice), 90%,70% ethanol and stained with hematoxylin. To remove formalin induced cross-links an overnight incubation in 1M NaSCN at 37Â°C was performed. Slides were subsequently washed in PBS twice for 10 minutes and air-dried. Tumor cells were collected by macro dissection by scraping from the slides and cells were transferred to a tube containing 200 Âµl ATL buffer (QIAampÂ® DNA Mini Kit cat 51304, Qiagen), 27 Âµl Proteinase-K was added and samples were incubated at 55Â°C while shaken at 450 rmp for at least 40 hours.  At intervals of 4, 16 and 24 hours additional 27 Âµl of Proteinase-K was added (Qiagen kit). Further isolation was done following the manufacturers instructions (Qiagen).!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Sample and reference DNA were labeled with the Cy5- or Cy3-conjugates from the Universal Linkages System (ULS; Kreatech biotechnology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = genomic DNA from blood from 8 healthy females!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = reference: genomic DNA from blood from 8 healthy females!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_growth_protocol_ch2 = FFPE tissue primary tumors used!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = DNA isolation for arrayCGH was performed as described elsewhere.
