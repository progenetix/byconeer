(If necessary pulse-spin the tube to pool any condensed probe.)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Pipet 43 ul of the probe solution onto a 24 x 60 mm coverslip prewarmed to 45ÂºC.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Gently lower the slide over the coverslip (try to avoid generating bubbles).!Sample_hyb_protocol = Place the slide into a hybridisation cassette.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Add 10 ul water into the lower groove of the cassette.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Close the hybridization cassette ensuring a good seal is made by the gasket.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Incubate for 36-40 hours at 45ÂºC.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Washing!Sample_hyb_protocol = Prewarm the wash buffer (0.1 xSSC with 0.1% SDS) to 45ÂºC.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Remove the slide from the hybridization cassette.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Soak slide in wash buffer until the coverslip slides off (usually 2-5 minutes).!Sample_hyb_protocol = Transfer slide immediately into a fresh coplin jar containing wash buffer.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Wash the slide in wash buffer for 5 minutes with agitation. Quickly change the wash buffer and repeat the wash step another 2 times.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Rinse the slide with 3 changes of 0.1 x SSC at room temperature, leaving the slide in the final 0.1x SSC so it will not dry out.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Dry the slide with a filtered air stream, or centrifuge the slide in a clean, dust-free 50 ml Falcon tube at 700 g for 3 minutes.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Store the slides in a dark, dust free box until ready to scan. (If the slides are not scanned within 2 hours, vacuum seal the slide box and leave the box at room temperature until scanning will take place.!Sample_scan_protocol = Images were scanned using and API Arrayworx e Auto Scanner. Data was processed using the Softworx (API) analysis package.!Sample_scan_protocol = An Applied Precision Arrayworx CCD scanner is used to scan slides at a 9.75 um resolution and at a high signal to noise ratio (SNR). The exposure time for each image wavelength is between 0.2-2 seconds, the standard exposure time is 1.00 sec for Cy3 and 2.00 sec for Cy5.!Sample_description = Follicular lymphoma, diagnostic biopsy!Sample_data_processing = Data was normalized using the application described in Khojasteh et al BMC Bioinformatics 2005;6:274!Sample_platform_id = GPL2616!Sample_contact_name = K-John,,Cheung!Sample_contact_email = kjcheungjr@bccancer.bc.ca!Sample_contact_phone = 1-604-877-6000 !Sample_contact_fax = 1-604-877-6089!Sample_contact_institute = British Columbia Cancer Agency!Sample_contact_address = 600 West 10th Ave!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_state = BC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V5Z 4E6!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM311nnn/GSM311059/suppl/GSM311059.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12393!Sample_data_row_count = 53856#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2(Cy5/Cy3; sample/ref)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	0.0903072	-0.0304093	0.0480994	-0.0304285	0.0163266	-0.0015977	-0.0718718	0.0149059	0.08074410	0.04201411	0.0859112	0.01448313	0.0828614	-0.01126215	0.11040416	-0.00746617	-0.02400418	-0.00914819	-0.0125920	-0.011533!sample_table_end
