Briefly, MCF7 cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 15 minutes.  Then the cells were sheared with a VirSonic 100 sonicator for 10 cycles of ten 1-second pulses. After centrifugation, the chromatin contained in the supernatant was collected. Part of it was set aside and served as input fraction. The rest  was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4Â°C. The antibodies used were:  anti-polymerase II antibody (Upstate 05-623) and anti-trimethylated histone H3K4 (Abcam Ab8580). After reversal of crosslinking at 65Â°C overnight, the ChIP DNA was purified using spin columns provided by the kit.  For ChIP-chip, the ChIP DNA was amplified using the ligation mediated-PCR method as described in the reference below.   A second round amplification of 15 cycles was added to increase the yield of DNA.  3 ?g of amplified ChIP DNA and Input DNA was labeled with Cy5âdUTP and Cy3-dUTP, respectively, with BioPrime DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen).  The labeled ChIP DNA and Input DNA were then combined and hybridized to the NimbleGen arrays. Reference: Li et al.

The slide containing the array was then removed from the MAUI hybridization chamber while immersed in wash buffer I (1X SSC, 0.05% SDS), placed in slide rack containing wash buffer I and washed twice in the same buffer for 5 min with agitation. The slide was transferred to wash buffer II (0.1X SSC) and the washing repeated as before. The slide was then removed from the slide rack, dried by centrifugation (1500 rpm for 3 min), loaded in a cassette, and scanned!Sample_source_name_ch2 = MCF7 ChIP input DNA!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = MCF7, Human breast cancer cell line!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = The reference DNA sample, corresponded to DNA obtained from the same cell line from which the nascent strand preparation was originated, was extracted according to arrayCGH protocol.

The test DNA consisted of the pooled DNA fractions containing nascent strands in the 0.7-1.5 kb size range. The reference DNA sample, corresponded to DNA obtained from the same cell line from which the nascent strand preparation was originated.
