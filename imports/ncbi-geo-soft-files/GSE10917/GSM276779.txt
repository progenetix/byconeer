About 108 cells were washed in PBS and collected by centrifugation. Cells were lysed with SDS in presence of Proteinase K, DNA extracted with phenol and chloroform, precipitated by centrifugation with ethanol in 0.3M Sodium Acetate, and resuspended in TE (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 1mM EDTA) buffer. The re-suspended DNA was denatured by incubation in boiling water for 12 min, followed by quenching in ice for 6 min, and applied onto to a 5-30% neutral sucrose gradient. After centrifugation of the gradient in a SW28 Beckman rotor for 24,000 rpm for 20 hrs at 15Â°C, the gradient was fractionated using an ISCO 185 fractionator. I ml fractions were collected and the linearity of the gradient assessed by measuring the refractive index of every third fraction. Only gradients with a regression line R2 value larger than 0.99 were further processed. The consistency of the gradients allowed us to identify fractions corresponding to the desired DNA size range, which in our experience falls around a refractive index of 1.35.  About 80 ul of every gradient fraction was concentrated 10-fold in a speedvac and analyzed by gel electrophoresis in 1% agarose to confirm the fragment size range in the fractions. Fractions containing nascent DNA strands in the range of 0.7-1.5kb in length were pooled and dialyzed. The quality and abundance of short nascent strands in our nascent DNA preparation was assessed by real time PCR, and used for hybridization to DNA tiling microarrays.

The slide containing the array was then removed from the MAUI hybridization chamber while immersed in wash buffer I (1X SSC, 0.05% SDS), placed in slide rack containing wash buffer I and washed twice in the same buffer for 5 min with agitation. The slide was transferred to wash buffer II (0.1X SSC) and the washing repeated as before. The slide was then removed from the slide rack, dried by centrifugation (1500 rpm for 3 min), loaded in a cassette, and scanned!Sample_source_name_ch2 = MCF7 DNA!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = MCF7, Human breast cancer cell line!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = The reference DNA sample, corresponded to DNA obtained from the same cell line from which the nascent strand preparation was originated, was extracted according to arrayCGH protocol.

The test DNA consisted of the pooled DNA fractions containing nascent strands in the 0.7-1.5 kb size range. The reference DNA sample, corresponded to DNA obtained from the same cell line from which the nascent strand preparation was originated.
