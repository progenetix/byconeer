Using the same procedure, we labeled control DNAs with cyanine-3. After ethanol-coprecipitation with 210g of Human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France), resuspension in hybridization buffer (50% formamide), denaturation at 95Â°C for 10 minutes and prehybridization at 37Â°C for 90 minutes, probes were cohybridized on aCGH.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Normal reference DNA!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: male!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Samples of of primary infiltrating ductal breast carcinomas were flash frozen and stored at â80Â°C.
