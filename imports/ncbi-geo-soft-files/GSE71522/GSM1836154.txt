Cell lines were cultured in ACL4 or RPMI growth media supplemented with 5% FBS. Xenografts were generated by injecting purified tumour cells intraperitoneally into athymic nude mice.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from cell pellets using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays werewashed and scanned according to manufacturer instructions (Affymetrix)!Sample_description = HCC5023X (this sample is identified as TX-OV-075x in the work of Reynolds et al.)!Sample_data_processing = CHP files were created from CEL file intensities using the Affymetrix Genotyping Console using the BIRDSEED V2 algorithm with default settings.  CEL files were imported into Partek Genomics Suite Software with correction for fragment length, GC content, probe sequence. The corrected probe intensities were then quantile normalized. Copy number profiles were generated using Partek's Paired Copy Number Analysis workflow using patient matched constitutional DNA (ie. BloodLine) as a baseline for defining somatic alterations in each OVCA sample (tumour/cell line/xenograft). The Genomic Segmentation algorithm was applied with SNR=0.3, a 30 marker minimum segment size, and p-values < 10-7 for defining copy number alterations (CNAs).!Sample_data_processing = SNP array normalized probe data = UTSWovca_SNP_Feb2015_AllCopyNumber_transpose.txt!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Kelsie,L,Thu!Sample_contact_institute = BC Cancer Research Centre!Sample_contact_address = 675 West 10th Avenue!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_state = British Columbia!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V5Z 1L3!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1836nnn/GSM1836154/suppl/GSM1836154_GW6_011215W_WL19_TX-OV-075X.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE71522!Sample_series_id = GSE71525!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype Calls: AA, AB, BB, NC (NoCall)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780286	AASNP_A-1780461	BBSNP_A-1780579	AASNP_A-1780711	AASNP_A-1781105	ABSNP_A-1781550	ABSNP_A-1781774	AASNP_A-1781749	ABSNP_A-1781702	BBSNP_A-1782317	AASNP_A-1782274	AASNP_A-1782550	BBSNP_A-1782686	AASNP_A-1782826	BBSNP_A-1782997	NCSNP_A-1783244	BBSNP_A-1783040	BBSNP_A-1783239	AASNP_A-1783526	AASNP_A-1783480	BB!sample_table_end
