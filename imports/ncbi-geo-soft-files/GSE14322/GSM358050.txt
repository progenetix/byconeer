Hybridizations were carried out on Human Genome CGH 105A Oligo Microarray glass slides (G4412A, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). DNA samples were hybridized onto the array for 36~V40 hours at 65Â°C utilizing the DNA Microarray Hybridization Chamber SureHyb and Hybridization Oven (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). After hybridization arrays were disassembled at room temperature, they were subsequently washed in wash solution 1 (0.5ÃSSPE and 0.005% N-Lauroylsarcosine) at room temperature for 5 min and wash solution 2 (0.1ÃSSPE and 0.005% N-Lauroylsarcosine) at 37Â°C for 1 min.!Sample_scan_protocol = Agilent Scanning Protocol!Sample_scan_protocol = Other: Dried array slides were scanned using the DNA Microarray Scanner (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).!Sample_description = No additional information.!Sample_data_processing = Agilent Data Processing Protocol!Sample_data_processing = Calculation Method: Raw image files of the arrays were processed using Feature Extraction software 8.1 using default CGH parameters (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).
