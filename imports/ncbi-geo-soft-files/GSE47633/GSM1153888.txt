After incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (FMS), precipitated with isopropanol and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48Â°C, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining, BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol, dried for 1 hour and scanned on an iScan (Illumina).!Sample_description = SAMPLE 20!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from sample was genotyped using Illumina HumanCytoSnp-12 Beadchip version 2.0.!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was done using GenomeStudio (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8855!Sample_contact_name = Wigard,,Kloosterman!Sample_contact_email = w.kloosterman@umcutrecht.nl!Sample_contact_institute = University Medical Center Utrecht!Sample_contact_address = Universiteitsweg 100!Sample_contact_city = Utrecht!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 3584 CG!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE47633!Sample_data_row_count = 300695
