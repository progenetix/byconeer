DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416978/suppl/GSM416978_KC0233.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416978/suppl/GSM416978_KC0234.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16611!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3829.682852766637	4091.097511815102	4085.796027979537	3795.470111016976	1.663091150435465	1.474047212656984	1.128248224449832	0.1102	1.079351764534972	3001.982032002612	2034.073234003692	3168.281722062514	1998.073033509397	1.263008668566186	.7887407001598065	1.60129769937102	0.3252	1.2528535791569663	2782.44339091244	2481.058643100824	2927.116647238528	2404.73902214035	1.168352897512604	.9317545731682	1.253927730711222	0.3689	1.291360708843074	9533.62274634194	12549.83913033092	10140.09072119442	10785.84601880351	4.269258499617692	4.410361485591324	.9680064805493575	-0.0432	.97052781763458485	9605.246937573149	10994.29938470959	10208.11910186963	9418.983152533621	4.059069812124078	3.776836138399922	1.074727540031357	0.0825	1.0588427748964156	8799.653448752986	13662.1369943584	9433.838671645513	11770.71203005235	3.791595981321584	4.702599221733257	.8062766573427237	-0.2689	.82997860768118717	3212.781831139934	5271.507600560947	3402.4369693507	4782.007511682838	1.300157976315412	1.831548705775739	.7098680871632836	-0.4224	.746198705941818	1230.961133457244	1682.0631132871	1267.082888214735	1673.372508856876	.5170341856432866	.671728986584664	.7697065274376399	-0.3308	.79507407729502549	2271.961748792594	2198.696771326038	2371.994971030608	2149.24690228603	.917994174568701	.7970205854966719	1.151782264189128	0.1737	1.1279323560781310	14441.81187082088	11419.92466060397	14513.09100158889	9823.022462488509	5.068739169539016	3.456252970890981	1.466541717932283	0.4790	1.39373742073257811	7063.884049215389	9023.858897523643	7614.753130175413	7765.788622719389	2.705671241795936	2.759233834056766	.980587874938428	0.0533	1.03765263320444112	19429.8202752859	30408.08160569528	18464.29842558392	23476.104337474	7.185636215316629	8.713380678948932	.8246668520608479	-0.1960	.872970071741174413	3393.714234915852	2449.472606051489	3603.077873604564	2376.30282645467	1.433996933598228	.8797844408231164	1.629941229986514	0.6430	1.56152985211663814	6803.649280723497	9115.30028913653	7320.72524854827	7895.320237247812	2.837516005351996	3.114042112086625	.9112002674397562	-0.1141	.923963704446825415	2162.535919601662	2760.627222516202	2253.088295510676	2652.309008326815	.8031577497442163	.923719167298218	.8694826070280309	-0.1369	.909478989613568816	3306.205631588141	3129.572591920407	3505.074445727344	2974.274811712501	1.366795384441265	1.124681372821079	1.215273425408374	0.2993	1.23053813514683417	337.6685330896246	362.0562948753908	352.627996073171	393.5760538049366	.1476918057545594	.1620019698073579	.9116667280662382	-0.1007	.93257540778810718	5108.510580327085	6881.750043537779	5496.384171916649	6079.957941864915	2.188927420522916	2.327129160981357	.940612776129641	-0.1844	.880029587976638519	1480.16661488004	1284.913030951965	1529.436240412172	1303.419273256373	.581963732842781	.5153104000475355	1.129345987950364	0.2931	1.22528330625416220	1635.656317579249	1355.614357089567	1692.630515601507	1369.491348796846	.6863188569997599	.5444203678316648	1.260641404239252	0.3942	1.314258741958858!sample_table_end
