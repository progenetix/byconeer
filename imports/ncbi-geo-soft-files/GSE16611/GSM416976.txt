DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416976/suppl/GSM416976_KC0229.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416976/suppl/GSM416976_KC0230.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16611!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	5959.837551087784	5761.809461508993	5824.795660489736	5790.967367581669	2.07589006095231	2.045158891744934	1.015026299096574	0.1335	1.0969427936057822	1376.014227402668	1171.40884917546	1305.31410606832	1265.587036735671	.519643908318315	.4931079243925445	1.05381374464517	-0.3130	.80496254058940963	3294.77382346069	4426.645523166065	3152.724148721956	4522.187637403128	1.174038039878861	1.638509856817933	.7165279079607741	-0.3083	.80759727153853114	8667.507603130125	9944.599472198923	8571.220842142286	9714.121456360515	3.548376448381514	3.893347357681166	.9113947773966118	-0.2887	.81866532444370885	10814.72438053105	14152.66426620532	10733.72369262251	13606.98687029194	3.917924182311614	4.950249279379612	.7914599773049461	-0.3497	.78475873678107726	15987.73060124002	12459.48116989491	15820.43671313612	12050.50146242764	5.745739943418828	4.287313542267035	1.340172554858353	0.3961	1.3159030223967797	2822.973571688601	2661.73114128945	2690.017839613932	2789.910888054169	1.014299454998069	1.076438317172973	.9422736433815382	-0.0835	.94373294351613968	1903.338150836686	1753.256382737345	1803.243861610875	1868.785178148594	.7108030412381099	.6860563910581804	1.036070868958396	-0.0427	.97084418186328929	4315.99765619568	3722.735271889568	4168.270900064378	3841.812506382138	1.411112828373655	1.297815280717033	1.087298669803014	0.2370	1.17852873374561410	10152.68014524955	11605.27169406327	10077.03868388	11266.79692963362	3.993418097901852	4.47182507078085	.8930175117973785	-0.0911	.938801254460953711	6086.612416869193	7069.790336156832	5952.812987286065	7010.695457477094	2.324501682511355	2.811654401407841	.8267380519268085	-0.1953	.87338633145459312	17610.43722916769	29645.0477779687	17400.10367303289	27356.30909786566	8.072132260037709	12.04993336444086	.6698901990494338	-0.2375	.848185393179400413	3654.505351779593	3798.90556202341	3509.933917892516	3911.845423017501	1.385106579180939	1.492947542375873	.9277664083070754	0.0328	1.02301687301230614	6600.728391433659	8073.458653681551	6474.121792333426	7952.548032248013	2.727978238111725	3.318408352139716	.8220743044938156	-0.1607	.894617416750566715	2098.214642081394	1979.51597068891	1989.698761558963	2101.117126462333	.6880610526652517	.7353926283578064	.935637679972058	-0.0105	.992722241675955216	3015.411418995284	3196.72282907258	2878.847243394572	3324.408938575174	.9099280658428108	1.119769212113386	.8126032185913261	-0.1029	.931172366309701617	644.2367044643318	533.8285769602727	610.0926409230598	587.2357117238469	.1723026898340792	.179396094222865	.9604595383220904	0.0436	1.03067840423647518	6595.768077651412	6371.4624741384	6470.088207280484	6361.143393070518	2.339155717280944	2.328784648638716	1.004453425372882	0.1478	1.10791269370477419	1922.152712277783	1956.398776524375	1820.779521051454	2077.090206749441	.7225328332877232	.7742978747955568	.9331458303156244	-0.1056	.929405855013543420	2880.836329586993	2898.93418278919	2747.700709619038	3027.10905444544	.9337011290231672	1.043451260984687	.8948200686844248	-0.1319	.9126101766377261!sample_table_end
