DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM417nnn/GSM417005/suppl/GSM417005_KC0253.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM417nnn/GSM417005/suppl/GSM417005_KC0254.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16611!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	677.4821370255669	455.8586988241253	604.2035314302886	523.444522903774	1.116968703423302	1.020524674125611	1.094504358143349	-0.3330	.79387847170748592	539.3320430871903	418.8075165759424	459.6856992925645	484.4474816434774	.7465510132133479	.8579911580801703	.8701150427748238	-0.3531	.7829060073369093	699.4794650951014	601.4347518790375	641.8832099122094	651.2501066740282	1.149199893600964	1.000705477625711	1.148389730340613	-0.1103	.9264142614395624	556.7036400991021	225.2409635475956	466.7991396771449	287.4502617995683	1.120570689422955	.8628142617599679	1.298739183027893	0.2273	1.1706805697592285	271.9659744361198	224.5231032216717	223.8356142942034	282.6397912570368	.4924236413298577	.5194831183995259	.9479107672391056	-0.1727	.88720039460153476	649.3981933787364	556.8440204596911	574.6651603718767	603.5417529035237	.9515234333665936	.9664641583318136	.9845408390612138	-0.1452	.90422638570098827	624.9767382290481	308.4485307303326	546.1488146122449	374.2860917958126	1.076586562395301	.8954865775284923	1.202236403550166	0.2059	1.1533660858162258	1385.758858294262	1054.902763803095	1297.030232729236	1052.94551824837	2.005535886375113	1.586930639831323	1.263782950582064	0.0712	1.0505839463558329	576.3744177062563	342.4526391613503	535.5813179772645	404.2849288458966	1.05032934027995	.8790549445461416	1.194839238202838	0.1051	1.07554930395570610	414.854812780828	370.0149858622802	343.8583739233123	443.2068447002532	.802282115694196	1.056671201115346	.7592542645691158	-0.1022	.931609326602636411	598.3116066801871	582.5647993865956	507.4975833747342	626.8041500250189	1.015623445336128	1.171044823565607	.8672797359231296	-0.1667	.890853954247695612	280.8223323377296	195.353656638636	238.8170732591668	240.0382115036008	.7247937480815312	.5394137897133463	1.343669297862591	-0.1629	.893247576482768313	499.6915285094107	592.8995041447963	416.778035869226	643.765793798577	.9337322540221016	1.346023436795228	.6936968766645264	-0.6248	.648502760902278414	559.3828506701944	507.4643145075325	506.9797392320459	565.5444748854849	1.398310444927662	1.434640842647001	.9746763115621976	-0.7900	.57834685574295815	915.8183789992632	856.6303615247543	830.8415067018988	927.6066237767554	1.815670561263307	1.768144197601218	1.026879235147544	-0.1849	.87968749801346116	654.770903376742	212.6791942964308	561.2722914520567	274.1786176540425	1.330354396441175	1.01356700159883	1.312547068267451	0.1608	1.11787174675776117	257.69486801026	288.0791109687046	212.1211783182966	353.7048052448204	.345254042525862	.5379651889856626	.6417776644188469	-0.2194	.858899957213158918	786.2192994037515	633.8083122197073	665.9989249657837	702.0750539482251	1.496815049769317	1.747534856986596	.8565294384744839	-0.2063	.866776691609460719	355.648301293719	157.4010754306536	309.4249150024712	202.1534767855173	.6774981916120433	.4440251983906954	1.525810233445166	0.2050	1.15266227310705920	685.6315878189187	753.263871369359	580.1675915711236	773.1874506527602	.6305002986841687	.7030771164973637	.8967726070011167	-0.3474	.7860179069888767!sample_table_end
