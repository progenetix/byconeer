DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416979/suppl/GSM416979_KC0237.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416979/suppl/GSM416979_KC0238.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16611!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3298.32292565567	3502.91647803743	3439.680126284062	3291.179101953517	1.634268436586444	1.54673919194753	1.056589530474561	0.0582	1.0411835204547082	1941.206703186654	1387.790200673468	2020.995819286811	1370.064987550078	.935316814142073	.6302059837560289	1.484144610255179	0.1293	1.0937789757109143	3155.753864148325	2604.927540879318	3293.186135944362	2482.075006254327	1.457568094535079	1.091063652062139	1.335914812834465	0.5482	1.4622698526726224	9591.17055102736	10165.3633409929	9591.305037178148	8990.909906776562	4.901131842092998	4.403297721575128	1.113059382307628	0.0038	1.0026214448058535	8448.838071400685	8967.201298166276	8532.30444221888	7956.401709192072	3.964925627008168	3.761424640515703	1.054102103841316	0.1123	1.0809165447724946	8277.152243418443	12865.02853620888	8376.07094066713	11641.09535692786	4.152658737711822	5.699452077139174	.7286066592907012	-0.5419	.68685493458744857	2021.813276122471	3941.36358116115	2100.514325208848	3672.466842139513	.9613520923900062	1.73819400241274	.5530752557284051	-0.6917	.61912190513850638	555.0046087076778	806.2974844354021	580.7948782296853	801.5417234164386	.3121420536028648	.416556026046874	.7493399064829283	-0.4620	.72597243049530079	2378.453416795888	2739.694431791088	2473.931693696117	2601.0691715436	1.231540580055689	1.288693319216856	.9556506281914308	0.0387	1.02720169350365910	12317.50310491522	10472.21511091348	12039.83275722945	9259.368621492365	5.825264819947586	4.317735274012936	1.349148210870636	0.2938	1.2259065786626311	7478.061912287669	7641.653349126557	7619.11520678518	6834.910798823678	3.670240765364442	3.310407522577512	1.108697566789831	0.0342	1.02400736759068512	19172.39199114628	22483.61748027731	17849.19805946801	23405.93174085271	9.291529848338902	11.24177677514875	.8265179103074617	-0.2935	.815903830281435913	3201.225250692468	2564.513464948956	3339.529586506998	2442.745593061596	1.611770886169674	1.099932409603448	1.465336298937456	0.4596	1.37515506752365214	6362.65059080066	8043.182954557941	6538.11830536486	7175.561726568591	3.079022023769806	3.301731624076629	.9325476369179136	-0.0422	.971172226423765515	1860.263653127172	2069.307816707789	1934.852193456686	1997.805089001733	.882226304301654	.8804933872408797	1.001968120471869	-0.0555	.962230375057680216	3053.893199599774	2746.768524163931	3185.878577291792	2608.846519200714	1.408602864521283	1.211074234099628	1.163102000571012	0.4090	1.32776114539280617	527.4141515531335	517.7030931496373	562.7505119647378	542.8489644079882	.2474272991632082	.2606411761698219	.9493024195148502	0.0946	1.06775544641070818	3907.560808581299	5557.140695218236	4074.299966813526	5068.726729272049	2.005873369145755	2.46368887728185	.8141747879134819	-0.1511	.90054004391554619	1359.418251881614	1316.633463567935	1415.972822064484	1304.459799979631	.6443435611796726	.614026087535748	1.049374895072613	0.2865	1.21964745687398320	1434.676014375361	1208.700326107876	1494.548408658259	1204.281521168134	.7511166644126532	.5928378861481969	1.266984924483875	0.2885	1.221406747676694!sample_table_end
