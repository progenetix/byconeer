DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416980/suppl/GSM416980_KC0241.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416980/suppl/GSM416980_KC0242.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16611!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2650.036169791332	4739.25753983211	2831.664785052975	4262.292934356314	2.304925641295376	3.280222485698612	.7026735690473994	-0.2366	.84873541620099412	270.3310231181506	352.0856634705962	304.646174642284	322.1228070950106	.2821652703511391	.298262017932303	.9460315205645208	-0.3677	.7749906379418683	2990.829809224265	3762.93041772429	3188.339403200483	3400.174462246502	2.657086075183628	2.843036743683322	.9345943491891764	-0.0311	.97865843419797824	3084.461726449948	4628.805052427696	3290.060340967761	4171.89485081386	3.156122698597927	3.826278709953286	.8248543657804946	-0.2845	.82100169856701085	4607.387177547384	6000.145511849089	4882.943877537509	5378.235079407306	4.36865543360287	4.853891516372443	.9000315352881616	-0.2246	.85584979544039056	8055.676093815732	16689.580461452	8429.241659025975	14651.89521299238	7.174950353593895	12.30630980574686	.5830302070116347	-0.6499	.63731465211526827	892.9368048033632	959.3467687198377	970.9137176699992	890.3323882415085	.7733486091354663	.7055380844459956	1.096111785011176	-0.1263	.91616139002034948	873.7540742199018	1166.146390765296	950.5539645515662	1079.561039423219	.8619212712238362	.965145133414308	.8930483524013576	-0.2184	.85954724735925349	1553.659353105817	2471.921040666925	1673.143719163308	2251.795947169617	1.53043743619592	1.961851110279997	.780098667109093	-0.2286	.853486995541301810	4304.930253749478	5208.642177715265	4566.200157664482	4672.889919374045	4.052301419678194	4.163886708514522	.973201651090037	-0.0120	.991701773400352811	4202.739230676162	5688.681100433052	4459.498077890316	5096.220196411324	4.36188397110929	4.577077789949866	.9529844523697873	-0.1564	.897283817498777612	17045.79325780369	26048.1906160129	17037.53001425681	22429.0319386636	16.51257844926261	22.30055979065389	.7404557824679806	-0.2553	.837808909049519313	1330.479764842652	1921.300510295464	1435.254646711017	1759.02945584393	1.27351331281386	1.600707819753675	.795593859852471	-0.4229	.74593873922813714	2631.373871546718	5271.794535950969	2811.348001175618	4743.25029856922	2.592076913022324	4.382537422659535	.591455739686377	-0.9067	.533385478298944415	1030.539905393387	1771.492850402803	1116.950136711652	1624.051471475265	.8869789882531566	1.23668678705858	.7172220141227577	-0.5137	.700425730615995916	967.8496375377392	1653.842358430698	1050.479915752746	1518.684697796388	.7586741252537395	1.073031105977436	.7070383337700676	-0.5035	.705400294051680817	389.350414985461	387.435627798737	433.5071265078422	357.3326412517052	.3067360329520016	.2513836141411276	1.2201910375105	0.0531	1.03745689984639718	3362.497144658716	5612.998204119463	3577.493273299924	5036.985535601762	2.618840260819322	3.857498027509894	.6788960725690494	-0.4224	.746188520799206319	1137.855179974187	1388.866038301505	1230.963879085144	1279.746939702447	1.022931467266411	1.098956855900319	.9308204064374996	-0.0396	.97290352845712520	1190.908581629526	1499.782258897399	1287.050962485212	1379.337614043492	1.133832092543011	1.156693124802254	.9802358708899988	-0.2494	.8412343506388911!sample_table_end
