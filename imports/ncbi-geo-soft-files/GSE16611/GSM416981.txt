DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416981/suppl/GSM416981_KC0243.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416981/suppl/GSM416981_KC0244.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16611!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3118.350864240389	3612.645032527891	3022.492854200826	3678.00558318055	1.290338063358615	1.613591655262022	.7996682798592465	-0.0554	.96235713441959682	2286.899442389481	1569.287569266059	2202.94560333416	1646.927575588668	.9288530754072442	.698093791903533	1.330556275073707	0.1081	1.0777967015493333	3374.520626986678	3108.182082995224	3276.700771592911	3188.654504820768	1.302091551868439	1.265909174035394	1.02858212782968	0.0008	1.0005406410125224	7794.555567827098	8767.312968452401	7724.832401717807	8433.477135013398	3.198415471649373	3.47576937809207	.9202035934285886	-0.2304	.85237993007355265	6995.226052826367	9827.942014632483	6918.381023682803	9375.877824885545	3.062851116472094	4.118546181632061	.7436728839248743	-0.3381	.79107623860112366	11567.4262957596	10021.54203389602	11511.5665673596	9551.94651734448	5.137182164373746	4.321109857135306	1.188857107136697	0.2369	1.178466076169717	4789.615687593628	4100.362562583278	4693.539646688157	4149.595759036676	2.058106662592315	1.852333741378967	1.111088469975266	0.2006	1.149203347648038	1777.700943993358	1713.408971916902	1709.889563846253	1794.127598364868	.7485364863810197	.7592339786965366	.9859101507365586	-0.0313	.97852789457217589	2534.754901356848	2423.778948186182	2442.881003869146	2511.034761983021	1.047733275604792	1.06107937229136	.987422150467643	0.0273	1.01908511836262510	8860.21336798551	9076.855270569513	8798.50326623778	8710.830091885411	3.584000406429732	3.544557405897773	1.011127764630453	-0.0386	.97361787413508111	8987.257082736633	10305.30157747349	8921.667399422204	9805.72337301016	4.149455905434639	4.551497593698755	.9116682630304548	-0.0150	.989689466130612112	14937.10321794574	25207.22325384305	14595.91426174689	26143.51482233887	6.969784492929447	11.80864721478987	.5902271755735121	-0.4466	.733784045074452413	3436.765206004109	3252.367532346693	3338.94203824555	3330.104686446556	1.333318191026276	1.328359057666433	1.003733277784513	0.0084	1.00584851620517414	8216.64291348945	8117.218355125759	8155.480285026974	7852.259804489913	3.39548583393569	3.330204946749042	1.019602663568912	-0.0666	.954916162722934215	2322.715854147484	1875.376640092618	2235.109081568918	1958.204383039425	.9505064154741591	.872275256591273	1.089686321252081	0.1161	1.08378854345732116	3045.247504009443	2940.78663430358	2947.658577988158	3023.83169941505	1.299383000893357	1.386103378112885	.9374358517633844	0.0093	1.00643305025052917	427.1355392581254	342.5195846526822	418.7058903972336	370.1671775473152	.2000163122571505	.1783058254766474	1.121759828779944	0.0451	1.03173307610534718	5852.536659579048	5415.407835812689	5765.32581513136	5384.353708433669	2.577208561369588	2.366694841709858	1.088948400085091	0.0650	1.04607420304517919	1521.091888861481	1438.092774718831	1463.095700191942	1512.58502501886	.642445695936996	.65194534595849	.9854287631925224	0.0874	1.06248496715460920	1112.780420710009	1144.484834905194	1071.321627001304	1212.850762260627	.5081053413583984	.5807542661376296	.874905912852968	-0.0539	.9633050892543336!sample_table_end
