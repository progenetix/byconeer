DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416977/suppl/GSM416977_KC0231.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416977/suppl/GSM416977_KC0232.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16611!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1937.858459823374	2100.648080197904	2011.343536141817	1883.658919899699	1.706780778262411	1.547442482068358	1.102968800482378	0.1166	1.0841403411773122	828.9195232223639	787.1055034845651	919.6267982386502	693.9781900957607	1.121760292252657	.8032742482351721	1.396484817877844	0.2313	1.1738568391811853	1385.647050519648	1309.103862414406	1464.057389380971	1177.781528107443	1.377870078295988	1.053752123352435	1.307584628074006	0.3085	1.2384084089083224	6110.009758395261	7073.68886232255	6120.829208855054	6322.16196146417	4.796570370470111	5.197886234094939	.9227924880324542	-0.0027	.9980979196884695	4218.209161392298	3911.738472821488	4270.59429624129	3508.890959973174	4.94050724926968	3.977058361393673	1.242251634330653	0.2506	1.1896942473742886	8865.262475704529	11339.59376194709	8766.909625919408	10041.30654448631	9.398424137014446	11.06165734779199	.8496397819527888	-0.1262	.91624587167784987	886.1673314262445	1230.071966667216	980.1318339531642	1103.053146929335	.7977625002751374	.9225430778267854	.8647428173808525	-0.2288	.85332249203053718	702.734214777226	1200.090384371152	800.7205949165146	1071.055381633776	.8400434064871574	1.09868350662631	.7645908957590983	-0.3716	.77293634311949699	3545.741065680156	2998.522339276512	3608.010852496856	2694.493051865042	3.134606801665111	2.3249010144145	1.348275381287373	0.2539	1.1924099122062910	7346.454968793289	5499.688415034626	7306.139552863297	4924.42668936924	7.483079414576467	5.050401931417432	1.481679976404628	0.5641	1.47847230860355811	3251.112379666291	3791.335257879778	3315.483574214416	3403.939245456232	2.697099354281606	2.900283634355704	.929943307038232	0.0222	1.01548734530832812	10801.68642530499	15446.80279277754	10595.83851355877	13552.59078288208	9.55174932880286	12.7186081260947	.7510058674742552	-0.0983	.934141796313557413	1881.062250108331	1733.476231170138	1960.161555423303	1552.422062725345	1.962462194948814	1.536699958577472	1.277062697890272	0.4467	1.36290551734317614	8931.34447123084	8825.866352831723	8825.409909231847	7849.517620841059	6.699205842382029	6.196682975867659	1.081095461631875	0.1086	1.07815420158733415	650.7329346102887	1099.437628351857	748.476975451514	985.1647776983406	.7040067777267925	.8719898060667689	.8073566603975716	-0.4263	.74415610262722616	2245.222554204814	1638.495903031425	2316.779854988542	1475.559658618991	1.609446783496011	1.071856300547623	1.50155089135897	0.4592	1.37482216343939817	162.3676120866551	344.3170187091528	274.0153411526756	310.7195223569919	.254923068054156	.3085723519902682	.8261371001320162	-0.2407	.846357397950110818	2772.309164946026	3875.064656175688	2841.12211710706	3479.651017538116	2.44877787083035	3.080537843558869	.7949189379220019	-0.2186	.859388542152717119	641.7291846535634	687.317068247713	740.6203570671595	595.6877528787963	.7074415816219636	.5790540738663832	1.22171937570239	0.2563	1.19443123868649120	1199.353005263442	925.3954365021818	1279.385733997575	822.8682411343966	1.394306643078412	.8949858109410914	1.557909216026874	0.5596	1.473877022234716!sample_table_end
