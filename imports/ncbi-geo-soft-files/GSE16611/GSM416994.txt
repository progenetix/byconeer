DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416994/suppl/GSM416994_KC0247.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416994/suppl/GSM416994_KC0248.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16611!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3023.353384709188	3593.704715261049	3261.043462234	3136.292434746028	3.1296033366339	2.955225018891205	1.059006781760436	0.0501	1.0353355804057542	157.3388754487757	260.2602354549373	199.4304806695175	248.5576843282744	.227180842284703	.2719287963224697	.8354423854960111	-0.5033	.70547021857493233	2723.06778578846	3828.403738498308	2949.752189768394	3344.24725075848	2.9345311810532	3.105090297773909	.9450711250352412	-0.2232	.85668160312943024	3624.139379604031	5729.80749707456	3889.81121215214	5030.041855405084	4.16326372097917	5.856823454666513	.710839886707192	-0.2162	.86082281891521155	4967.285022673008	8028.87280978631	5253.132365561994	7080.446697231858	5.785624713011094	7.550585880137085	.7662484481146057	-0.3513	.78389429180357486	8566.054661499673	12691.29842931676	8598.32823815882	11288.72969519974	9.696029711807927	11.75863458050896	.8245880629609841	-0.2762	.82574179084509787	941.5380706524938	1066.782944010918	1053.727426988629	944.5817348398984	1.057512820827624	.9629640486858316	1.098185152676078	-0.0367	.97486979339999148	661.01815201529	1088.957281939893	742.6428086557377	961.8199045936836	.8235866600089533	1.056004413321179	.7799083504004856	-0.1976	.87201199260155379	1222.936743469786	1925.810317216632	1361.507490302571	1679.8570199473	1.510527298940944	1.711424067919376	.8826142668294547	-0.0507	.965444654409565610	2820.436030058076	4312.225104796241	3052.879573349751	3773.563252584512	3.292956563286226	3.993945955287256	.8244870111291694	-0.3319	.794513129002756511	2808.912076693926	4673.161520120876	3037.93720003553	4091.51036846287	3.623168950698794	4.776549937346462	.7585326225463038	-0.8235	.565057904696616112	21480.56551551897	18855.98293532343	18844.12494875162	16906.00697673154	21.04292676663715	20.03090598744479	1.050522965852203	-0.1632	.89305102973664713	751.0914458994079	2122.674818523074	843.2737966363097	1848.618769060517	.8610157707238384	1.916838797550579	.4491852793380864	-0.6152	.652844365161113814	2518.686448894212	7373.749213348435	2742.082076152052	6494.273275589564	2.816536511544513	7.700646479576332	.3657532544851314	-0.9714	.510016506962291415	655.6987245088793	1723.000865187201	737.1109181806694	1503.895496295378	.6900179226722783	1.363896245318439	.50591672573391	-0.6920	.618976489303422116	615.2535771901182	1408.241797556404	691.5639925533704	1233.185946954638	.6225735300585474	1.167555271875572	.5332283148004112	-0.3058	.809014884087439717	282.8892568948509	343.7191476766027	318.5993932552114	323.2359846061625	.3464051633261243	.3084129462218964	1.123186194255585	0.1073	1.07719633750776818	2226.734351350823	4361.2399272415	2432.849238483171	3817.478661942951	2.31243442577454	3.887824330800987	.5947888147760322	0.0053	1.00369263305572719	796.8347218414422	1105.819409018057	894.3546570313479	976.098165632008	.8780160784844139	.9873058335296236	.8893050650227617	0.0625	1.04427991356115720	910.2169227753368	1801.025156152105	1020.056339087565	1571.001291091355	1.1102085346993	1.624238619932557	.6835255122461001	-0.1393	.9079535232527632!sample_table_end
