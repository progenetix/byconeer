Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = LCIS Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213347/suppl/GSM213347.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8598!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Ref Mean#CH1_BK_MEAN = Ref Bk#CH2_SIG_MEAN = Test Mean#CH2_BK_MEAN = Test Bk!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANCTB-2327O11	0.8208749561833382	1017	205	2975	471RP11-396B3	1.2835071621633476	2156	206	9969	546RP11-392B15	-0.9480331657246779	2843	182	2377	516RP11-121D03	-0.3219301542545972	3487	199	4388	487RP11-236I04	0.20192829446630411	1318	194	2788	466RP11-362I3	-0.2440099198312196	4823	162	7216	522RP11-321I5	-0.37567253767258935	1614	199	2321	556RP11-566G8	-0.20427181294664742	2671	216	3514	474RP11-1009O05	-0.06832311517103684	353	128	1142	750RP11-292J24	-0.06224520167433256	3606	162	6807	507RP11-387B8	-0.17015846807929325	2142	206	3255	508RP11-395E17	-0.2851395442871677	3143	199	4419	518RP11-114I18	-0.13073019704270128	4194	235	7158	573RP11-122D19	0.28789329956949383	4675	308	9546	668RP11-465B24	0.0029484457928349306	1617	211	2705	521RP11-1014J07	-0.4056697167052302	3436	195	4582	459RP11-352F8	-0.9453961535465921	1429	207	1676	505RP11-339B3	-0.19323984303289699	1593	195	2672	506RP11-513C18	-0.03504926382151208	227	203	539	468RP11-1020M16	-0.5411779469949988	3025	196	3509	477!sample_table_end
