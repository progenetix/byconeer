Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = LCIS Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213355/suppl/GSM213355.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8598!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Ref Mean#CH1_BK_MEAN = Ref Bk#CH2_SIG_MEAN = Test Mean#CH2_BK_MEAN = Test Bk!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANCTB-2327O11	0.1359357745497693	764	120	741	430RP11-396B3	0.22980050140925457	2098	120	1007	428RP11-392B15	-0.09183294643601858	2865	122	962	440RP11-121D03	0.08395760980956113	2918	118	1087	432RP11-236I04	0.1724542321677225	1254	118	780	435RP11-362I3	0.2186054795525827	2832	259	1017	449RP11-321I5	0.8997154418082463	2211	203	1358	478RP11-566G8	0.30076172780931576	2175	132	1073	439RP11-1009O05	-0.541384065058832	2790	96	853	414RP11-292J24	-0.45517361427497605	4295	126	976	441RP11-387B8	-0.39345020316176105	2187	134	768	430RP11-395E17	0.1832064793723358	3010	123	1172	428RP11-114I18	-0.681275095345367	5492	193	845	437RP11-122D19	0.2560360305839713	3187	123	1164	473RP11-465B24	-0.6180772652573656	1949	114	616	421RP11-1014J07	-0.6763557924578738	2183	121	652	426RP11-352F8	0.5517418485539402	1280	127	994	442RP11-339B3	0.006917609054978957	2013	141	880	458RP11-513C18	-0.13057546919131524	193	144	489	434RP11-1020M16	0.2836298231991725	3480	148	1088	459!sample_table_end
