Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = LCIS Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213334/suppl/GSM213334.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8598!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Reference Mean#CH1_BK_MEAN = Reference Bk#CH2_SIG_MEAN = Test Mean#CH2_BK_MEAN = Test Bk!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANCTB-2327O11	0.27121567528821666	1538	97	1568	322RP11-396B3	-0.16318226718514672	2861	91	2029	341RP11-392B15	0.11130159651300815	2013	73	2057	341RP11-121D03	-0.16663328970416302	5203	120	2646	329RP11-236I04	-0.22377444233034355	1691	89	1563	318RP11-362I3	0.3400600224148732	5196	132	4555	391RP11-321I5	1.0638398752263898	3463	144	5136	370RP11-566G8	0.28070057877457	8128	98	5237	322RP11-1009O05	-0.18676593135490527	2300	79	1855	362RP11-292J24	-0.5696480342843211	6592	82	3341	347RP11-387B8	0.6803867187904262	3001	95	3182	328RP11-395E17	0.43208829972641793	6729	98	4755	327RP11-114I18	-0.5448765254594609	3378	108	1748	336RP11-122D19	-0.3819815567243655	4973	87	2851	350RP11-465B24	-0.5890365331083425	4207	110	1764	329RP11-1014J07	-0.34547642084980434	2644	642	1495	569RP11-352F8	0.00845118456516547	2891	127	2463	355RP11-339B3	-0.05602802585962252	2151	101	2123	341RP11-513C18	-0.08156881917502279	181	115	414	329RP11-1020M16	-0.3765906059188586	4034	1330	2497	928!sample_table_end
