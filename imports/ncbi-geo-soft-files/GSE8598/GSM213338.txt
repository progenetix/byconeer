Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = LCIS Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213338/suppl/GSM213338.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8598!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Reference Mean#CH1_BK_MEAN = Reference BK#CH2_SIG_MEAN = Test Mean#CH2_BK_MEAN = Test BK!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANCTB-2327O11	0.12532154714011523	1554	145	2248	371RP11-396B3	-0.1050747162121517	2096	80	3067	345RP11-392B15	0.0636716601636399	2570	87	4539	356RP11-121D03	-0.42977907714884866	4855	199	4561	434RP11-236I04	0.2687774471990466	1876	105	3184	367RP11-362I3	0.4101315701631125	2976	84	7156	420RP11-321I5	0.057596983502580745	3427	111	4622	404RP11-566G8	-0.1342494046561743	3993	135	4819	365RP11-1009O05	0.06368657784114273	2267	111	3662	385RP11-292J24	-0.3677959543894929	3786	89	4153	358RP11-387B8	0.4157758039775269	3034	109	5359	357RP11-395E17	0.2514339418444622	6991	126	9717	385RP11-114I18	0.03529176882111518	4665	131	6535	424RP11-122D19	-0.17317952604098258	4110	85	5558	359RP11-465B24	-0.36654258048265603	3233	111	3438	361RP11-1014J07	-0.4580334174835938	2975	130	2762	365RP11-352F8	0.10540732156294619	2276	100	3497	367RP11-339B3	-0.20890553566299042	2080	76	3183	360RP11-513C18	-0.10969142515137631	169	145	442	369RP11-1020M16	-0.6013422158941262	5503	226	4494	395!sample_table_end
