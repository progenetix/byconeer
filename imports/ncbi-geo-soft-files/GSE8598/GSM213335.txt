Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = LCIS Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213335/suppl/GSM213335.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8598!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Reference Mean#CH1_BK_MEAN = Reference bk#CH2_SIG_MEAN = Test Mean#CH2_BK_MEAN = Test bk!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANCTB-2327O11	0.1630688409801565	1553	87	1253	309RP11-396B3	-0.058143753400131226	2479	77	1671	329RP11-392B15	0.19756799985537954	2609	83	2202	338RP11-121D03	-0.328172459900159	5756	84	2310	320RP11-236I04	0.12645179128983114	1874	858	1905	1297RP11-362I3	-0.04656993674602561	4181	89	3078	363RP11-321I5	0.5035608973552452	4993	90	4134	335RP11-566G8	0.134826600282411	4572	151	3184	365RP11-1009O05	-0.14932359856746413	2584	89	1874	382RP11-292J24	-0.3149085440237185	6655	85	3493	497RP11-387B8	0.2562905645893615	3283	103	2236	323RP11-395E17	0.22833907283738175	8836	87	4830	328RP11-114I18	-0.2931680460949798	4550	95	2398	335RP11-122D19	-0.6101474378234788	5015	88	2238	341RP11-465B24	-0.16778857130589853	3310	110	1773	327RP11-1014J07	-0.4518240565277296	2332	111	1241	323RP11-352F8	-0.05184157627415198	3122	79	2047	332RP11-339B3	0.41116363850777105	2745	85	2644	338RP11-513C18	-0.27793185319794667	156	77	379	304RP11-1020M16	-0.5615230018383975	4825	119	2016	338!sample_table_end
