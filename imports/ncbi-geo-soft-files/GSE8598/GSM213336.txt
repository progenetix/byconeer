Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = LCIS Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213336/suppl/GSM213336.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8598!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Reference Mean#CH1_BK_MEAN = Reference Bk#CH2_SIG_MEAN = Test Mean#CH2_BK_MEAN = Test bk!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANCTB-2327O11	0.02888537865153329	2344	106	5026	429RP11-396B3	-0.1069472316280784	5787	186	11261	572RP11-392B15	-0.305257057304932	4840	150	9328	509RP11-121D03	-0.6040164636099387	9455	118	11478	477RP11-236I04	-0.027286523842024124	2743	96	6508	399RP11-362I3	0.13703255080348153	6947	192	20948	639RP11-321I5	-0.15836431938287698	3766	136	8379	503RP11-566G8	-0.30464910053867644	4927	113	8837	439RP11-1009O05	-0.12100892811058739	1660	116	3128	486RP11-292J24	-0.18438077836364164	10978	203	18380	591RP11-387B8	0.18182718278859666	5685	115	11592	447RP11-395E17	0.2822710249312489	7648	105	17568	411RP11-114I18	0.16027602147001163	7133	151	19542	549RP11-122D19	-0.25126047076079805	9836	190	18804	561RP11-465B24	-0.4068589539127633	8554	130	12519	464RP11-1014J07	-0.14913302700704623	3486	115	6820	436RP11-352F8	-0.4091954489566133	5223	147	8392	518RP11-339B3	-0.5624060347383749	3966	156	7009	505RP11-513C18	-0.19617369093100878	242	120	751	475RP11-1020M16	-0.4911396809399966	7628	112	12785	449!sample_table_end
