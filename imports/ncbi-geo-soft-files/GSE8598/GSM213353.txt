Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = LCIS Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213353/suppl/GSM213353.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8598!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Ref Mean#CH1_BK_MEAN = Ref Bk#CH2_SIG_MEAN = Test Mean#CH2_BK_MEAN = Test Bk!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANCTB-2327O11	0.2371181950892327	1247	97	490	255RP11-396B3	-0.1447267095533391	1738	83	530	278RP11-392B15	-0.42257140718575004	2049	90	454	264RP11-121D03	-0.09571485466651808	3348	92	662	262RP11-236I04	-0.159048876154255	1339	97	430	263RP11-362I3	0.28771280361013996	3410	89	915	272RP11-321I5	0.9961380359363251	1674	82	848	276RP11-566G8	-0.4578925098102329	2352	93	435	254RP11-1009O05	-0.2239678808905501	1120	76	490	319RP11-292J24	-0.1459046867030882	1418	80	482	292RP11-387B8	-0.2640217260620705	1940	88	468	251RP11-395E17	0.5303456910135342	3172	93	972	248RP11-114I18	0.1515656079190828	4324	90	1028	271RP11-122D19	-0.17001650856413564	3426	99	707	273RP11-465B24	-0.3634416832188432	1554	86	420	258RP11-1014J07	0.25925198821984696	2405	102	674	252RP11-352F8	-0.2535459018868187	1669	84	527	275RP11-339B3	0.12345530458806664	1671	92	588	269RP11-513C18	-0.08014077629657113	226	88	314	253RP11-1020M16	-0.7278483544489118	4185	137	565	269!sample_table_end
