Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = LCIS Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213357/suppl/GSM213357.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8598!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Ref Mean#CH1_BK_MEAN = Ref bk#CH2_SIG_MEAN = test mean#CH2_BK_MEAN = test bk!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANCTB-2327O11	0.07884323864397158	871	100	1425	386RP11-396B3	-0.22247831738078325	1482	123	1704	430RP11-392B15	-0.6205504271360085	3009	182	2091	441RP11-121D03	-0.3183765271188356	2055	127	2085	420RP11-236I04	0.10872856799635411	1252	118	1830	414RP11-362I3	0.5160869799446031	3055	133	4181	431RP11-321I5	-0.09562712557623759	1799	164	2133	451RP11-566G8	-0.4423153082213557	1343	104	1372	391RP11-1009O05	0.23079164801574215	2700	148	3628	516RP11-292J24	-0.5677092707610873	3472	242	2608	500RP11-387B8	0.18351951049648807	1381	104	2003	404RP11-395E17	0.06368144272975851	2344	129	2805	419RP11-114I18	-0.08745697545497802	3777	296	3571	700RP11-122D19	0.28704006919261976	3334	129	4030	417RP11-465B24	-0.34010540308872356	928	99	1157	407RP11-1014J07	-0.5453859289682698	1529	112	1394	390RP11-352F8	-0.09474341766419714	1103	132	1612	430RP11-339B3	-0.7477981230750326	2138	138	1595	436RP11-513C18	-0.07761513120280905	203	95	565	405RP11-1020M16	-0.4491474780814331	2630	107	2096	393!sample_table_end
