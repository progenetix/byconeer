Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = LCIS Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213344/suppl/GSM213344.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8598!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Ref Mean#CH1_BK_MEAN = Ref Bk#CH2_SIG_MEAN = Test Mean#CH2_BK_MEAN = Test Bk!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANCTB-2327O11	0.13565413624249856	1664	125	3898	345RP11-396B3	0.04171993540869812	3298	189	8167	461RP11-392B15	-0.4325233735152567	3927	150	7241	409RP11-121D03	0.10878992952263178	3482	134	7303	366RP11-236I04	0.0027034262881950877	1837	235	5046	603RP11-362I3	0.45764875506249214	4317	137	13149	370RP11-321I5	0.03219934119450518	2379	110	5817	359RP11-566G8	-0.5375827258178965	1894	117	3568	339RP11-1009O05	0.25761267352020933	3579	109	9474	340RP11-292J24	-0.15572917994861257	6033	167	11943	425RP11-387B8	0.2443095953243064	2572	164	5970	407RP11-395E17	0.23661372646202095	3619	130	8242	349RP11-114I18	0.2889054108862408	6663	136	16652	443RP11-122D19	-0.02869448690026677	4790	198	10994	499RP11-465B24	-0.4211005933781501	2831	156	4450	400RP11-1014J07	-0.3726696423680248	1501	185	2545	486RP11-352F8	-0.48429472402687335	2380	152	3904	389RP11-339B3	-0.6186866694044532	2546	175	3712	413RP11-513C18	0.26316308393850485	237	120	748	353RP11-1020M16	-0.46805292788615704	4673	111	7775	325!sample_table_end
