All patients had given informed consent according to the research ethical committee at Uppsala University for the storage, isolation of DNA and use of the material in research projects. The tumor cell content in the samples were at least 50% based upon an examination of a  hematoxylin-eosin stained section. All patients had stage II and III, but these samples were selected based upon microarray analysis complexity rather than any clinical characteristics. All samples were fully anonymized. Tissue was reviewed by a pathologist to contain more than 50% tumor cells on hematoxylin-eosin stained tissue section. DNA was extracted from 2-10 frozen tissue sections (10Âµm) using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA concentrations were measured with a ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, U.S.A.).!Sample_data_processing = Log ratio, Allele Frequency, segments produced in BioDiscovery Nexus Copy Number 3.0, European HapMap reference set, Rank Segmentation algorithm.
