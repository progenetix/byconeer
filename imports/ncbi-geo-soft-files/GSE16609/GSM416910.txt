DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416910/suppl/GSM416910_KC0100.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416910/suppl/GSM416910_KC0101.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16609!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1162.971532822748	1550.46878130843	1279.104070421827	1457.388155938759	.951484981221218	1.054940652080321	.901932236040871	-0.0955	.9359508923440872	356.9257204745237	494.7594842942118	403.5253266071278	458.8126528460988	1.05225452548449	1.150949013206886	.9142494701416842	-0.3513	.78386177275450323	841.332749262425	826.3415987568073	891.0813856926263	801.1641939342992	.5977038510341527	.5764121726068646	1.036938287286674	0.1568	1.1148033072356244	873.2305187420396	762.9928797343523	872.3708361993332	699.5990787095776	1.659320487873168	1.462179206013738	1.134827031494236	0.0825	1.0588849345166315	480.7317265887823	516.3223523696148	512.8104640105964	472.7267845584674	1.363497353320794	1.281476278506492	1.064005144839586	-0.1020	.93176359683345086	1624.312061419371	2108.071464366047	1580.600213063137	2093.959315435182	2.091482668368973	2.868139572127204	.7292123049708454	-0.2173	.86016031513495327	1979.869965363416	2016.064230744969	1948.681011067398	2012.441026792436	1.56963337848415	1.752624703752127	.8955901255549934	0.0208	1.0144893095741118	424.2791003484949	639.157970098655	471.3717399039642	611.1053550600947	.6711401718540816	.810336850130388	.8282236846887701	-0.2100	.86453799361283769	1401.73491504851	1282.241012138248	1415.681339453801	1200.303125722502	1.601883622338727	1.495074698974108	1.07144052630809	0.2476	1.18724515519820210	1141.666402038836	930.0720796664888	1170.238094070556	827.5044997983427	1.791467297344703	1.293367166352633	1.385118892724592	0.2757	1.21056730117887611	487.426823853219	711.9890640832357	592.2138838019393	644.115068539986	.4990498211379642	.5992373612039681	.8328082550381866	-0.1513	.900460821079212	1127.303891149394	1561.142596914085	1152.630299341336	1438.333731972434	1.975141062674915	2.759861367726165	.7156667670964295	-0.1800	.882716486115213313	462.5675677437281	420.2364683852834	476.7931678906419	379.9987274504227	1.247324965110445	1.025418199073481	1.21640611239148	0.2060	1.15347965975985914	1429.159452859706	1653.214272753061	1453.231423515922	1550.346672770482	1.570909933526604	1.846974054936427	.8505316733215695	-0.1541	.898699593136238215	599.154296420992	746.9318993681111	653.833945090605	691.9539652549914	.8549964499468783	.912458363382504	.9370251665811764	0.1300	1.09429824120022816	1297.913690367252	1342.660782879479	1413.789259985816	1282.461834016508	1.050911868915982	.9834067095489352	1.068644192389138	0.1387	1.10094759600278417	503.0298569551975	497.3747455142641	594.062319645671	465.5716855798473	.5725946441202323	.4564649382228067	1.254411009856668	0.3256	1.25320975910898318	2250.34770134845	2044.666121573392	2172.831925763163	1940.436950549864	1.575641720841636	1.434788406289622	1.098170095279946	0.1300	1.09428115231608119	524.7262497810638	502.3053825666841	512.6615686364189	480.1687440926536	.9214063068039532	.8820247242109328	1.044649068798215	0.2253	1.1689870975314120	222.2669478029311	383.4248256103428	262.7634019611856	357.5898088771582	.3738843070328959	.5156891517613033	.7250187554962482	-0.2889	.818510557351195!sample_table_end
