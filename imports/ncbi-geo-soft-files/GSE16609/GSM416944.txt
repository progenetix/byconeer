DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416944/suppl/GSM416944_KC0169.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416944/suppl/GSM416944_KC0170.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16609!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3051.606781492974	4174.90906208708	3391.93837136221	3747.707051105788	1.400379384783949	1.553436690679182	.9014718096890612	-0.0861	.94207269875070282	2108.384135097666	2547.173893598944	2360.719783844522	2270.57136036091	.9627978692543272	.9414525803347448	1.022672718058718	-0.1038	.93054734390587563	2728.817320052104	3541.460038203334	3041.868710789917	3170.867299690549	1.248031157528304	1.286022351681298	.970458371813425	-0.0115	.99209061629240044	8721.651220421523	9388.21251448016	9256.898640424812	8622.76405922045	3.78937073250744	3.453207547418398	1.097348097521782	0.1963	1.1457921582834935	8003.820349481858	11089.55241150844	8531.991171945161	10244.15419691263	3.659623112648368	4.431423636800526	.8258346329737515	-0.0564	.96163706506991766	7959.526304260442	9622.557821527722	8486.170545717052	8845.044422734341	3.560478816366962	3.667329338198946	.9708642142610356	-0.0747	.94954964142095947	2590.957029378314	3784.568763481382	2890.911048030717	3391.410330632036	1.148363197476218	1.360580041987379	.8440247262475062	-0.1738	.88652435381178078	960.2090468676872	1266.932924807834	1086.853018393103	1135.460817085232	.4450261105619712	.4615996886061565	.9640953439673438	-0.0790	.94670292779125849	2576.967472113184	3622.008794751108	2875.322830030625	3244.645896431966	1.173426266580006	1.356566571407834	.8649971857718957	-0.0879	.940897723427549810	12759.56870575581	14693.5319029525	13462.45089193414	13663.32444414768	5.463084404541361	5.578332259116253	.9793400878216694	0.0033	1.00227829672028411	8173.919724034215	12636.59693731602	8706.372292367008	11712.93391113184	3.808017215930958	5.002970535193027	.7611512378783246	-0.3062	.808790928338443112	15261.63164210844	20160.52726104028	16090.11731661303	18880.38065059204	7.416471893389554	8.613112877942287	.8610675371946813	0.1520	1.11111997706832913	4156.498582295965	4883.598305165124	4570.941584899525	4398.331867767664	1.882177333930162	1.79339111818087	1.049507447008744	0.0727	1.05164895779993914	7482.592123115064	8646.219137899518	8004.318308145575	7919.508289877006	3.440587527185419	3.325283668843882	1.034674893881046	-0.0256	.982391705842001415	2271.73439161102	2653.574598123128	2540.670692356784	2370.389981219973	1.080857095955351	1.005766239923705	1.074660346560591	0.1771	1.1306182278421416	3270.479290568138	4364.38039169212	3628.489870028158	3920.585771592441	1.349871350676628	1.543368509062819	.8746267289698118	-0.1189	.920870403409701817	517.27440835286	573.6804606458599	586.1715669425874	523.0647728717638	.2398497010571248	.2202275408024825	1.089099484029752	0.0336	1.02355586478739518	4711.158695332112	6551.413789949796	5156.614928769774	5953.173490550064	2.099315553743733	2.519400522619055	.8332599500937548	-0.2738	.827125804245529719	2039.576671018112	2622.02537488434	2285.339471283239	2338.043962536609	.8990528148491707	.9282035309930918	.9685944782899796	0.0637	1.04514340698988220	1527.69398813469	1826.267977397518	1719.670925931296	1630.425127324713	.7096322364502579	.6786800460213676	1.045606454190515	0.1908	1.141406842882292!sample_table_end
