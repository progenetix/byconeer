DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416935/suppl/GSM416935_KC0159.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416935/suppl/GSM416935_KC0160.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16609!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2758.994178789532	3406.297369340242	3128.272987533776	2918.260726898814	1.879534857221946	1.76775651118401	1.063231754673651	0.2680	1.2041766820627612	1679.369826347468	1936.600418555033	1946.096520774276	1663.795382442292	1.158108422238412	.938204449382923	1.23438811551163	0.0220	1.0153976471260783	3259.588268377334	3712.274771778846	3663.945924551664	3183.314912300386	1.928324893292366	1.819492462082625	1.059814719476864	0.3122	1.2415926627038674	8666.44924272879	8650.266886259607	9027.928709874546	7449.551080411409	4.754319487884029	3.82941560215388	1.241526118295944	0.2117	1.1580762523465955	9028.024361024938	11499.13179889104	9371.189163105104	9933.556396225322	5.243313212619731	5.544619009908361	.9456579799711772	0.0012	1.0008414946051566	6628.271856500089	8706.475083076844	7069.607207699501	7498.728032108892	3.940242863380271	4.129258503326815	.9542252828699732	-0.0620	.95790866590807287	1784.995408935783	3412.697904014259	2062.94665458906	2925.719129338336	1.24935107306255	1.772600473820888	.7048125573212441	-0.3691	.77426750011029878	659.2107581522962	959.72460788043	805.917640297121	825.0481133088165	.4505131181108559	.4627641680757399	.9735263643772892	0.0265	1.0185282645241849	1547.648338372639	2100.704815974843	1800.148253985298	1803.876824981694	.9431062594909678	.9492745365340334	.993502114714267	0.2218	1.16618060500607310	11468.03801026152	12065.68420682636	11767.37574515534	10460.17848459491	6.065755720479232	5.467865369714898	1.109346209231101	0.0970	1.06957815007134711	9279.163605509799	12920.0254517839	9598.37826053886	11235.62632409739	5.586509681898406	6.458620073194916	.8649695474554987	-0.1886	.87742931326646612	18148.22349924618	24186.72061209343	18773.91694998066	22023.2836043778	10.99855310741225	12.71302231395592	.865140706575998	0.0197	1.01373651711779113	3178.07120959962	3796.56591018724	3576.687334979021	3254.991633988156	1.907130159124334	1.777790088316024	1.072753286036612	0.1706	1.12549736260425814	8221.815660345368	9360.778137831297	8592.631123062418	8065.787262548078	4.73074363923375	4.536979970482777	1.042707631510737	0.1785	1.13174231397923715	2363.930702116092	2718.631726315284	2700.569772763398	2332.249113077536	1.499852722562036	1.318384462728578	1.137644416301663	0.2969	1.22851325883066816	2709.04095261272	3768.429857865718	3072.569263976038	3231.394463341994	1.85036255031192	1.852185853172414	.9990155940035004	0.1410	1.10266138953362117	323.2708747873572	452.0724819778719	426.4791373790164	377.8507452330426	.2288386210281084	.207892202570016	1.10075615246338	0.3312	1.25809391150972518	3146.321447009156	4966.995211143397	3543.932373104099	4261.299197008388	1.956576942913012	2.406123770781936	.8131655431329571	-0.3230	.799417686751707119	1198.968001013493	1268.665695929621	1410.914084369513	1091.157829493442	.7355695507482976	.6060611356164246	1.213688698253436	0.3876	1.3082160557758720	871.9292264752241	1348.270001307383	1045.546573940409	1159.617788875618	.662407733234898	.7359368526200807	.9000877329034351	0.1540	1.11264413098483!sample_table_end
