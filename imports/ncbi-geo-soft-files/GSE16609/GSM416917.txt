DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416917/suppl/GSM416917_KC0115.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416917/suppl/GSM416917_KC0116.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16609!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	5670.135826399188	7243.394499048741	6014.928036356125	6755.524878733212	1.719836745756593	1.866414679438947	.9214655053364582	-0.1007	.93258530211760582	2955.25625764779	2741.629559137045	3257.550501654217	2468.611246547866	.9625555547475771	.750777623435705	1.282078107686182	0.2253	1.1690494601641213	4652.679798242899	4747.80846365347	5001.407497669963	4348.596975432302	1.483378830499279	1.260747155373456	1.176587092960663	0.0269	1.0188205596574274	11251.00723709531	11900.42503161848	11396.75566909162	11459.79173939568	3.039884297372047	3.077456866977801	.9877910329113232	-0.0271	.98141174819273925	12622.5306013721	15899.53974578029	12683.62951875001	15632.74589170459	3.83260466706743	4.701021165169482	.8152706683100536	-0.0814	.94515947380719226	11853.45260388204	13758.37125984761	11960.9435040214	13378.16277624232	3.419068838676502	3.887781896500075	.8794394669501586	-0.0485	.96691685575954687	2903.444927371172	4051.42904648237	3203.777869293746	3688.28057259574	.9111385253033634	1.035761890415861	.8796795226145452	0.0803	1.0572300424954698	1494.043816013018	1860.486187356092	1710.709787590591	1661.279560194584	.4805687602253565	.4704191433117252	1.021575688527849	-0.0338	.9768176743805649	6015.455258184327	7215.17940766705	6354.867705653181	6727.634738677213	1.840143445487893	1.93957246559536	.9487366304321364	0.0219	1.01526238853570710	18402.59990357861	20584.31956763757	18054.94054397109	20672.79252257255	5.24963267105824	5.963797691591431	.8802499585892866	-0.0219	.984901181326063711	18966.90312326911	24250.94728684046	18578.68670511707	24788.14194235936	5.493036932650546	7.143308126757258	.7689766191206061	-0.3173	.802562304983082912	17211.22801350706	18474.27567821814	16941.08627992614	18364.95732526665	5.137380479040217	5.356940762636559	.9590138675552046	0.0407	1.02862471316602313	8545.879010977373	9123.687063904295	8818.384873438059	8627.571922990235	2.506557540995652	2.483157693822317	1.009423423744513	-0.0174	.987994717815234814	9828.474094362986	10351.92975167333	10043.97864194704	9868.068240217313	2.919540265137247	2.820634710903148	1.035064999325074	-0.0820	.944750788938000215	3678.32960958478	3958.432750378618	4007.101077895674	3599.857910603372	1.117784589494247	1.006515083039664	1.110549268788452	0.0637	1.04512914144029316	6959.962661300666	7401.462046242375	7277.853421462512	6911.761568075178	1.943014368344923	1.840646653719708	1.055615082024757	-0.0196	.986473254606128417	1761.424459034669	1279.156577289543	1997.513844313296	1140.4284429623	.5574454695062486	.33517237771993	1.663160530406386	0.5382	1.45220486117607918	7284.799226130162	9713.049161696708	7594.222151558423	9221.50193864557	2.146240873182835	2.769271364264986	.7750200651616119	-0.2470	.84264154337433119	4224.997712695121	4794.675797157356	4565.763623084095	4393.004838657504	1.208531649324475	1.153181527773084	1.047997752494594	0.0401	1.02815995962396620	1750.642386263074	2747.627498676093	1986.18338568235	2473.967083825998	.580359942084387	.7096328956961896	.8178312273912013	-0.2243	.8560306032725863!sample_table_end
