DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416943/suppl/GSM416943_KC0165.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416943/suppl/GSM416943_KC0166.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16609!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2816.749413596934	3335.417787004706	2925.888986670546	3142.268159520422	1.749864489869364	1.991530233216161	.8786532389435403	-0.0494	.9663489943315692	1241.669004889058	965.0348069213082	1304.45497937303	939.1172185052596	.7902157376246125	.5924628535558857	1.333781068098767	0.3761	1.297787416533743	2286.089931386261	2641.702591526204	2379.360788634372	2505.353166022846	1.334307325377874	1.522555364619087	.8763604637206027	0.1533	1.1120897779912234	8107.398045720315	7687.499088053202	8177.84252859636	7067.16024794878	4.197746425881937	3.580035253647504	1.17254332107626	0.0689	1.0489461540894615	8552.51893925367	8320.217641255644	8616.592619823628	7631.663277853486	5.233583058554245	4.793158385001724	1.091886108944502	-0.0315	.97839282364097446	7890.432409179352	7403.211728467291	7965.362270922256	6814.301802024243	5.081958767860857	4.510128509850055	1.12678801873648	0.1538	1.1125065943816627	2792.228137732206	2907.632562552447	2900.857756143073	2748.975835642953	1.633035970850812	1.577228900228788	1.035382987601818	-0.0198	.98637894650017788	1093.858306030393	1040.281031262519	1149.821337668212	1010.226305262614	.6510856155974986	.5706721300902289	1.140910132573945	0.1990	1.1478946198741929	2275.053294701222	2608.907718544972	2366.850862114418	2474.992732720056	1.283447281929158	1.4007538137059	.9162547118352004	0.1478	1.1078760439188610	13128.02735165003	12602.75202150272	13224.46836434848	11591.63114684756	7.090591758033627	6.271678289008936	1.130573258271208	0.1242	1.08986956134756611	8519.048462977624	11225.71404777501	8581.119322261762	10246.72147746992	4.893129472872652	5.758423239199182	.8497342535650674	-0.1524	.899721636684450312	18098.79568565761	21949.28093635505	18440.9637454475	20598.56071841553	10.87223831891123	11.56885520764204	.9397851493317468	0.1106	1.07968963722815413	3835.993717921842	3935.791953833908	3968.073591814038	3694.232445030456	2.379348445289502	2.27121779929846	1.047609104694602	0.0957	1.06859962492091214	7178.932126829185	8465.090139526343	7275.022165948006	7748.664415419997	4.193874521863088	4.243815695359652	.9882320116891102	0.1187	1.08576681259556615	1901.218652062208	1748.0455341796	1981.305735577206	1675.820539986934	1.199671712560325	1.070473065616892	1.120693038520291	0.2951	1.2270054549965616	3427.96131821946	3854.75869288219	3553.17367339285	3620.08738731832	1.907792338524254	2.05641204572176	.927728634197266	0.1773	1.13073623406138417	490.3037845014379	570.4897955398151	530.9377866098661	564.439964523316	.300544248620057	.3096345414780438	.970641864390858	0.0388	1.02726628895622918	4503.923295095301	5696.666221623854	4638.716688960032	5286.056670691964	2.544088391298194	2.905707595474464	.8755486599066339	-0.0480	.967260638496035219	1480.284041322086	1574.592798698778	1547.864922715742	1512.249317263639	.8505562529598871	.8425707368683437	1.009477561636218	0.1971	1.14638695312535220	1319.022069364575	1549.507695364691	1382.015978136427	1488.998594702856	.8397903710074524	.9403582235995008	.8930536788341202	0.0463	1.032608228851302!sample_table_end
