DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416934/suppl/GSM416934_KC0153.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416934/suppl/GSM416934_KC0154.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16609!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3163.331420992704	3336.36504688852	3306.120231453548	3128.246883298664	1.606836156603618	1.540164333884705	1.043288772017431	0.0315	1.0220925203977722	1967.322269440475	1513.134651424566	2097.92427486925	1424.116473627258	.9915125772569559	.7047824779439275	1.406834886346083	0.0804	1.0572859390064033	2924.971317933998	3324.458264753531	3069.808762638834	3117.297881126471	1.429490249428721	1.480140928061152	.9657798269933802	-0.0965	.9353114011470934	5690.717389086655	7445.067528430835	5712.742706297891	6925.926514877389	2.785157102936012	3.290229003417094	.8464933899869781	-0.1782	.88379109671606875	6973.96626219491	6978.212361704566	6918.094021756193	6493.533203876781	3.465418868766508	3.342496460476457	1.036775628558939	0.0424	1.0297962937233876	7173.586617752937	7293.445663248897	7103.311849671511	6784.77770852401	3.62193401217092	3.385935448998422	1.069699664015245	0.1093	1.0787126631014997	2870.59981031295	2923.723133272134	3015.50553958997	2745.590778590596	1.474152058656727	1.380340922703468	1.067962294249398	0.0294	1.0206032846799348	934.6459224853022	1047.523510672784	1030.738033620837	982.8462928666193	.516128686004914	.4903880901756804	1.052490254851035	0.1254	1.0908082662136119	2332.920093541106	2709.276875268026	2471.9391617228	2548.601318018432	1.245774652593783	1.266070510033427	.9839694098560844	0.1316	1.09547037936777910	10672.97975893559	11859.272732709	10522.87776946781	11232.89162047218	5.127645986226439	5.354482688073998	.9576361125692328	0.0168	1.01168613125466811	9671.296041158053	12315.85130974454	9535.620416595286	11702.56964580568	4.741899826883722	5.760034279023436	.8232415984315408	-0.1922	.875242916068021112	11485.94227480284	11179.78775040467	11334.593288253	10530.22373504432	5.837223033926355	5.309724035249392	1.099345840796072	0.2419	1.18256337714782313	3673.264450068934	3965.425036837507	3809.754695675377	3710.571592154634	1.846930342387389	1.789695934271232	1.031979962081918	-0.0167	.988463939567190414	4131.605433131418	4867.279359948731	4250.119897456488	4539.228931890137	2.013362452737232	2.180724698647465	.923253840333888	-0.1545	.898413646185809515	2217.822181780051	2352.477230211408	2354.037099208558	2213.886821478163	1.18801302519324	1.15365380099488	1.029782959297434	0.0746	1.05307358185617116	3592.21073566145	4284.088632526451	3730.628862204614	4003.412192853306	1.723555508800741	1.934215347380184	.8910877018607196	0.0202	1.01409676502983217	638.3225551878245	629.0349039617774	719.5642535415284	591.0658841135878	.3426351776841164	.2952531229468414	1.160479436303222	0.2248	1.16863347026954418	4071.678627864208	5048.92831044851	4190.783251913386	4705.364729520409	2.034353949954328	2.303492760766636	.8831605571346637	-0.1017	.931945610793751619	1777.536881243152	1826.683067826222	1901.157565281956	1720.241537664398	.933483949365317	.8325943407460755	1.121174987243891	0.0927	1.06634038770089320	1091.659310785969	1201.013320314891	1192.98656938498	1128.891100808907	.6039481050385334	.572290979333947	1.055316485577721	0.1231	1.089071154898389!sample_table_end
