DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416929/suppl/GSM416929_KC0113.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416929/suppl/GSM416929_KC0114.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16609!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	4967.156172046799	4655.212846454542	5112.060856483877	4326.056763515362	2.075016720535905	1.707372748212813	1.215327304894566	0.1801	1.1329330180425932	2398.955933556526	1679.420330571231	2598.554466904108	1538.916029282101	1.049823862889252	.6367169929939189	1.648807671918502	0.4105	1.3291369278795173	4072.614868132955	3937.756463925872	4250.837379753666	3649.122971785228	1.671901418784257	1.389929864444706	1.20286746946919	0.2388	1.1799827342796344	9899.29146357039	9393.010438279995	9640.741093474575	8962.58193855348	3.588035523016928	3.362925111482976	1.066938871390652	0.0484	1.034101298289395	10904.53397826342	10475.25284024334	10551.50497957465	10070.0160663368	4.562111211656017	4.302448770868068	1.060352244644056	0.0189	1.0131517872602846	7940.891488048726	9975.473913788293	7871.560753940857	9553.784524902292	3.480255546060002	4.248992506589258	.8190778262524323	-0.2113	.86377794414058087	1780.595525482607	2773.44964296573	1960.735765390462	2553.183041486698	.7602728948268743	1.000191050224132	.7601276722647189	-0.1992	.87106353161195398	1251.684205571071	1388.915730805951	1410.581940191197	1271.292172271564	.5859061153977141	.5288298857592433	1.107929281561927	0.1410	1.102642395536239	3940.667255611688	4342.774132802208	4123.290803597946	4028.506687311263	1.673510791028829	1.662228307891752	1.006787565272178	0.1073	1.07723460490688710	15740.4004872983	14820.2470281299	14924.26249014226	14646.27908887498	5.748973259704445	5.824012774596884	.9871154961713436	0.0797	1.05682221976362111	16666.08005737179	19381.84178574175	15765.18476468252	19935.1531939379	6.51207834294239	7.987406373017331	.8152932302206605	-0.2154	.86128903642447312	17521.14720781783	15307.93297027064	16528.87549776593	15181.50406376015	6.816181304676295	6.229032878456794	1.094259965820724	0.1809	1.13356444633644313	6207.533260133797	6197.455938819512	6273.16591039881	5803.32652618454	2.480457916027772	2.264021156336114	1.095598382146711	0.1420	1.10341286784165814	10243.84552982363	7846.627549606021	9955.637292689296	7416.920989197833	3.643186004996613	2.764064637996569	1.318053838146579	0.2684	1.20447264478758415	3361.037255305754	2463.171575016096	3557.093020901336	2264.191100533725	1.509167542032203	.979868981755751	1.540172788537548	0.3988	1.31844917336299216	5399.588820958801	4387.126541779256	5518.554235046149	4077.030969947844	2.263861177240903	1.726244559484328	1.311437110577875	0.2337	1.17584860754173517	1000.131461316611	949.833640298117	1147.295323328486	869.1041502951707	.5055305066324481	.3897045158215602	1.29721490541804	0.3085	1.23841682383474718	4738.200456186077	6442.158021738998	4891.545455013429	6040.83566222715	1.963505269603969	2.519794702336849	.7792322397467625	-0.1687	.889643747356785919	2982.937463263615	2936.961792440274	3185.526534823428	2705.08736979205	1.203493683007439	1.039533392723836	1.157724890254835	0.2909	1.22341371249279720	1437.427487069008	1605.341309726834	1603.038732539132	1470.597777826919	.718235759046024	.6493870823760578	1.106021013565675	0.1123	1.080940447693699!sample_table_end
