DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416931/suppl/GSM416931_KC0117.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416931/suppl/GSM416931_KC0118.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16609!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	4257.862078763844	4991.127110670334	4531.0351478322	4583.927495568863	1.746044313236918	1.766484988493828	.9884286164954406	0.0102	1.0070961369245632	2768.82308548115	2669.922357888842	3026.038212840853	2440.041279605672	1.089447264961012	.882113995085263	1.235041356367676	-0.0730	.95066203854828283	3715.520367339524	3773.81037040521	3989.358223215168	3465.02134404537	1.323225462672745	1.171916653142828	1.129112261630671	0.0702	1.0498864694766824	14109.55748993684	13035.67804078006	13475.37934158792	11961.73630599579	4.606825160504225	4.070733801056698	1.131694034944846	-0.0750	.94935836090617825	18507.23313355161	15360.37940419866	17525.27665328905	14137.4953106264	6.494114079431764	5.218789291562863	1.244371772190669	-0.3465	.78650370744995146	14056.06147505332	12485.43124634444	13402.75166453727	11459.97480008443	4.928875249743689	4.186488442383186	1.177329238472206	0.1019	1.0731720635726347	3857.038722655542	3969.671564345209	4130.884131359156	3642.142536484532	1.470148150634905	1.337617650846914	1.09907950878495	-0.0801	.94596542052540068	1464.15576409998	1665.946040096004	1665.625478453862	1511.683001896672	.6203407705901325	.5555045573570242	1.11671589796056	0.2217	1.166099837437939	2954.413209697202	3063.577181587052	3216.35199228183	2805.990890971715	1.091800415625788	.9626092067653916	1.134209404971839	0.2883	1.2212015374457610	17117.43488786186	14281.0106724614	16148.71018719879	13118.22964338435	5.260816233002407	4.44642197311932	1.183157213779187	-0.0034	.9976130646438611	8224.865577438602	9563.315712086778	8280.026422706474	8772.205686688561	2.818544930143056	3.047095048784328	.924994096021897	-0.1848	.879775066251239712	20123.95044939782	21398.21082613312	19145.76491309737	20255.19421242926	6.764281301808808	7.249990507408026	.9330055390965104	-0.1588	.895756434852674113	4545.551226068273	3807.238229181884	4817.10428171702	3492.600847267232	1.664204949467879	1.260461541823451	1.320313943938623	0.2043	1.15209162136829614	8816.116381167094	8954.759894584799	8810.527252951373	8202.252707133646	3.15713253800914	2.939949270537034	1.073873134359368	0.2042	1.15208324365731215	2352.100964531853	1974.242418861128	2589.571467599258	1795.340046984031	.9052769493659442	.6355173084650168	1.424472531759183	0.2562	1.19431712071789616	4001.835086873374	4549.5822705144	4275.572066584916	4180.526451491054	1.558047160551836	1.462077305091405	1.06563938522692	-0.1258	.916491169288664317	481.6800287505628	474.5679149415343	611.9237102769816	374.816086842475	.2309432911903448	.1350565427297374	1.709974848478738	0.6664	1.58710483743881218	7991.235623614435	8791.914274994177	8072.360945497262	8056.10099433318	2.701251661504366	2.77611678595859	.973032429747593	0.1765	1.13014167813990819	1586.308774074275	1717.670138636728	1794.501065907112	1561.496402396701	.6139008636875574	.5413233741854071	1.134074183682473	-0.0563	.961698053393765620	1921.522452601962	2390.379435631937	2145.527390367579	2180.859556412302	.7849220052053315	.7772890575708575	1.009819960232462	0.1272	1.092203777899452!sample_table_end
