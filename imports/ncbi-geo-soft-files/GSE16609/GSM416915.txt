DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416915/suppl/GSM416915_KC0102.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416915/suppl/GSM416915_KC0103.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16609!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1951.57903079494	2658.842761108971	2025.043251893098	2516.325451401281	1.512238974846014	1.827784133511695	.8273619116829578	-0.0526	.96421673541411862	943.04014787509	799.8310479078926	1000.276342025624	771.8328934712206	.7359594307004168	.5622007700322625	1.309068699173398	-0.0911	.93878653790758223	1883.499832195834	2277.533348068628	1956.4653560372	2165.427224745184	1.315065938750557	1.495868575356925	.8791320042516252	0.0415	1.0291567219794094	5712.785936379395	5846.757724757978	5630.730332811116	5435.713962564549	3.525106826002	3.33324878077433	1.057558873593318	0.0898	1.0642032686956925	6990.41598639608	6372.209203268822	6829.243876327198	5913.702299712075	5.138675887747201	4.48673628378549	1.145303749257058	0.1104	1.0795554020503356	5472.209867895366	6296.090614859306	5403.775542417579	5844.549180796333	3.944124755281408	4.210173373095444	.93680815628302	-0.0199	.98630569343303487	1339.660679405756	1433.59952742498	1403.819893400614	1371.548613167771	1.041720808000781	1.021936866809929	1.019359259689505	0.0378	1.0265673432747448	954.6497325863368	807.1961944500264	1011.1754855162	777.2729075533471	.715610905423715	.5385087373573532	1.328875198823074	0.1726	1.1270994822478829	1575.705342619661	1883.361232235915	1644.679180648787	1793.628052007172	1.195451571118135	1.315062378011118	.9090455259819078	0.0435	1.03061598997466110	8045.736496544378	8228.026387977547	7823.534176191708	7665.059012513814	5.220395361576818	5.273522751577918	.9899256355753459	0.0639	1.04530208542195711	6224.255935214707	8048.462576600156	6113.949468504994	7480.121901504956	4.330315568480203	5.274971408761524	.82091735346427	-0.2423	.845414618121389612	9280.76788159454	12178.34134683256	9030.705766364807	11776.30081208726	6.548356532120368	8.565556540388547	.7644986640673465	-0.0091	.993709287743795613	3190.73479680745	3267.648866413345	3250.840860607562	3076.654520923488	2.306359571986796	2.201781382693752	1.047497081279295	0.1753	1.12917693181143714	5110.916329081757	5160.316997100014	5068.630051904066	4806.825966374226	3.297152675802616	3.215890510223794	1.025268946601409	0.0207	1.01446004335119515	1634.177717004938	1656.014239902678	1704.082412154013	1581.255304445498	1.191007458981291	1.134044657243553	1.050229769501488	0.1050	1.07547180049761916	2157.842848642968	2872.979803725736	2233.090601083763	2712.787642750687	1.590842676474312	1.974895370276755	.8055326375348061	-0.0130	.99104096617120117	430.1342288803026	476.2813996890851	476.8796834410016	463.3546313941014	.3380175526761694	.3305082340194938	1.022720519139118	0.1939	1.14382014519119918	3214.321839387792	3910.77605805066	3272.576541108992	3667.763590637382	2.199522884622881	2.55853799695063	.8596795854680922	-0.1040	.930422112490061819	1206.134412817356	1477.961401150312	1268.722517412254	1412.666913463138	.8801591422121967	.9870381465291802	.8917174531776582	0.0626	1.04436624946535220	860.9650650469584	1055.466070857519	915.7840541623988	1015.319855160018	.693610712044473	.7780552192217066	.891467205551678	-0.0175	.9879715157924436!sample_table_end
