DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = P5A!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Operating Software (GCOS version 1.4). Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-name = birdseed-v2!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-version = 2.4!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sufi,,Thomas!Sample_contact_email = dkumar2@kumc.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 9139076900!Sample_contact_laboratory = Sufi Thomas lab!Sample_contact_department = Otolaryngology!Sample_contact_institute = KUMC!Sample_contact_address = 3901 Rainbow Blvd!Sample_contact_city = Kansas City!Sample_contact_state = Kansas!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 66160!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1922nnn/GSM1922922/suppl/GSM1922922_4-P5A_052814_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1922nnn/GSM1922922/suppl/GSM1922922_P5A_052814_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE74555!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	NC	0.596959	AB	3374.520020	613.948853SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.196680	AA	340.472778	700.165222SNP_A-1969580	NC	0.390780	AB	903.899475	2539.813721SNP_A-4263484	NC	0.639537	AB	643.602905	1844.042236SNP_A-1978185	NC	0.973766	BB	2182.317871	719.385498SNP_A-4264431	NC	0.555718	BB	1519.495239	445.909332SNP_A-1980898	NC	0.228093	AA	317.957672	868.204773SNP_A-1983139	NC	0.474636	AB	1717.737915	612.301453SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.680897	AB	2253.707275	687.534851SNP_A-1995832	NC	0.196037	BB	1669.412964	1097.749023SNP_A-1995893	NC	0.196557	AA	1037.342651	1915.431641SNP_A-1997689	NC	0.958592	AA	752.334412	3712.246582SNP_A-1997709	NC	0.665175	AB	1668.863770	299.835754SNP_A-1997896	NC	0.196103	BB	1146.074097	1590.884644SNP_A-1997922	NC	0.553173	BB	1283.910400	423.943390SNP_A-2000230	NC	0.196074	BB	2078.528809	1801.208618SNP_A-2000332	NC	0.624870	AA	2280.615479	3573.861084SNP_A-2000337	NC	0.206577	BB	1158.704468	522.241028SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.875083	AB	2892.367188	993.410706SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.195986	BB	654.585876	576.057617!sample_table_end
