DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = P1B!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Operating Software (GCOS version 1.4). Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-name = birdseed-v2!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-version = 2.4!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sufi,,Thomas!Sample_contact_email = dkumar2@kumc.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 9139076900!Sample_contact_laboratory = Sufi Thomas lab!Sample_contact_department = Otolaryngology!Sample_contact_institute = KUMC!Sample_contact_address = 3901 Rainbow Blvd!Sample_contact_city = Kansas City!Sample_contact_state = Kansas!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 66160!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1922nnn/GSM1922918/suppl/GSM1922918_5-P1B_052814_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1922nnn/GSM1922918/suppl/GSM1922918_P1B_052814_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE74555!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	NC	0.595004	AB	1842.406372	2454.973633SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.196088	BB	577.285461	507.728973SNP_A-1969580	NC	0.280588	AB	1390.121460	3315.524658SNP_A-4263484	NC	0.500089	AB	1003.360718	2100.470947SNP_A-1978185	NC	0.659992	BB	1710.349976	623.992432SNP_A-4264431	NC	0.196038	AA	1127.352661	1013.441406SNP_A-1980898	NC	0.463968	AA	340.726288	1233.871460SNP_A-1983139	NC	0.362436	AB	2032.594604	793.347290SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.713891	AB	2118.952148	663.643005SNP_A-1995832	NC	0.196061	AA	1375.336548	1291.667114SNP_A-1995893	NC	0.196065	AA	1247.984375	2050.403809SNP_A-1997689	NC	0.623430	AA	779.906433	3000.672607SNP_A-1997709	NC	0.621025	AB	1740.591919	325.605316SNP_A-1997896	NC	0.975001	AB	1768.817749	699.597290SNP_A-1997922	NC	0.196011	AA	1057.124146	1106.183228SNP_A-2000230	NC	0.527768	BB	2122.648438	1262.097290SNP_A-2000332	NC	0.268532	AA	2786.962891	2948.589111SNP_A-2000337	NC	0.337704	BB	1406.922485	412.634918SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.974171	AB	2787.298828	1179.436035SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.561988	BB	1206.653687	317.540833!sample_table_end
