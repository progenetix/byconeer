DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = P1A!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Operating Software (GCOS version 1.4). Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-name = birdseed-v2!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-version = 2.4!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sufi,,Thomas!Sample_contact_email = dkumar2@kumc.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 9139076900!Sample_contact_laboratory = Sufi Thomas lab!Sample_contact_department = Otolaryngology!Sample_contact_institute = KUMC!Sample_contact_address = 3901 Rainbow Blvd!Sample_contact_city = Kansas City!Sample_contact_state = Kansas!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 66160!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1922nnn/GSM1922917/suppl/GSM1922917_4-P1A_052814_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1922nnn/GSM1922917/suppl/GSM1922917_P1A_052814_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE74555!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	NC	0.301080	AB	2273.906494	3203.134033SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.196104	AA	543.490540	681.794128SNP_A-1969580	NC	0.380080	AB	1349.000977	4143.166504SNP_A-4263484	NC	0.532251	AB	836.305237	2592.112793SNP_A-1978185	NC	0.714138	BB	1667.207397	487.304657SNP_A-4264431	NC	0.196035	AA	1420.313843	1384.657471SNP_A-1980898	NC	0.523302	AA	378.174469	1314.425049SNP_A-1983139	NC	0.451691	AB	2495.408447	743.382446SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.611303	AB	3018.368896	662.345215SNP_A-1995832	NC	0.196054	AA	1610.481323	1593.193359SNP_A-1995893	NC	0.196354	AA	1289.033447	2233.928223SNP_A-1997689	NC	0.988646	AA	900.594788	3863.857910SNP_A-1997709	NC	0.477411	AB	2475.419189	475.959442SNP_A-1997896	NC	0.856737	AB	1973.528320	481.902161SNP_A-1997922	NC	0.196024	AA	977.850342	1193.949707SNP_A-2000230	NC	0.811376	AB	2890.330078	1261.480835SNP_A-2000332	NC	0.196025	AA	2596.975098	3022.690918SNP_A-2000337	NC	0.352418	BB	1440.303101	423.555328SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.679998	AB	3605.078857	1182.604492SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.195750	AA	1525.122070	269.584503!sample_table_end
