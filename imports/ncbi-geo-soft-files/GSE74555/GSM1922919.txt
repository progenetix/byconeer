DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = N5!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Operating Software (GCOS version 1.4). Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-name = birdseed-v2!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-version = 2.4!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sufi,,Thomas!Sample_contact_email = dkumar2@kumc.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 9139076900!Sample_contact_laboratory = Sufi Thomas lab!Sample_contact_department = Otolaryngology!Sample_contact_institute = KUMC!Sample_contact_address = 3901 Rainbow Blvd!Sample_contact_city = Kansas City!Sample_contact_state = Kansas!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 66160!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1922nnn/GSM1922919/suppl/GSM1922919_1-N5_052814_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1922nnn/GSM1922919/suppl/GSM1922919_N5_052814_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE74555!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	NC	0.195107	AA	3210.348389	695.081055SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.199529	AA	314.673950	728.584045SNP_A-1969580	NC	0.360691	AB	1046.650146	2869.381348SNP_A-4263484	NC	0.598511	AB	747.243958	1871.501831SNP_A-1978185	NC	0.591515	BB	1523.749390	493.639191SNP_A-4264431	NC	0.787690	BB	1788.380493	435.115021SNP_A-1980898	NC	0.347354	AA	304.495850	1071.671387SNP_A-1983139	NC	0.459650	AB	2068.702881	673.876709SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.733750	AB	2170.907959	559.796936SNP_A-1995832	NC	0.846709	BB	1612.807983	1203.562866SNP_A-1995893	NC	0.196072	AA	1147.159058	1758.694214SNP_A-1997689	NC	0.195599	BB	657.761353	3108.991211SNP_A-1997709	NC	0.648688	AB	1626.802856	319.763031SNP_A-1997896	NC	0.196098	BB	1272.689209	1804.071777SNP_A-1997922	NC	0.570737	BB	1296.014038	404.580658SNP_A-2000230	NC	0.198841	BB	1751.908936	1356.234619SNP_A-2000332	NC	0.471978	AA	1790.076782	2986.005615SNP_A-2000337	NC	0.262718	BB	1196.353394	336.726562SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.893243	AB	2851.569580	981.340637SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.195987	BB	717.557739	620.017456!sample_table_end
