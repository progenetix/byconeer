DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = M5A!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Operating Software (GCOS version 1.4). Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-name = birdseed-v2!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-version = 2.4!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sufi,,Thomas!Sample_contact_email = dkumar2@kumc.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 9139076900!Sample_contact_laboratory = Sufi Thomas lab!Sample_contact_department = Otolaryngology!Sample_contact_institute = KUMC!Sample_contact_address = 3901 Rainbow Blvd!Sample_contact_city = Kansas City!Sample_contact_state = Kansas!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 66160!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1922nnn/GSM1922920/suppl/GSM1922920_2-M5A_052814_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1922nnn/GSM1922920/suppl/GSM1922920_M5A_052814_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE74555!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	NC	0.195892	AA	2636.033691	564.382629SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.196703	AA	284.008820	652.648499SNP_A-1969580	NC	0.358780	AB	1077.882080	2962.098145SNP_A-4263484	NC	0.609389	AB	722.222717	1856.698242SNP_A-1978185	NC	0.375388	BB	1259.605835	476.636017SNP_A-4264431	NC	0.975849	BB	1962.098145	506.231049SNP_A-1980898	NC	0.267237	AA	298.027496	942.368103SNP_A-1983139	NC	0.481540	AB	1798.027466	615.784546SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.137386	AA	2171.340088	722.222717SNP_A-1995832	NC	0.196033	BB	1410.696289	1088.785522SNP_A-1995893	NC	0.196086	AA	1006.231079	1413.811523SNP_A-1997689	NC	0.715954	AA	865.005737	3258.048340SNP_A-1997709	NC	0.598921	AB	1701.973511	349.429382SNP_A-1997896	NC	0.196093	BB	1201.973511	1573.728394SNP_A-1997922	NC	0.386812	BB	1185.358765	510.384705SNP_A-2000230	NC	0.443513	BB	2065.421143	1281.931885SNP_A-2000332	NC	0.982214	AB	1778.297485	3379.543701SNP_A-2000337	NC	0.236866	BB	1249.740845	486.501007SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.914473	BB	2579.958984	1001.558167SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.195994	BB	653.167725	549.325500!sample_table_end
