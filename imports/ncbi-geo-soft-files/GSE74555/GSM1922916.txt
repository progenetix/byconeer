DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = M1B!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Operating Software (GCOS version 1.4). Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-name = birdseed-v2!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-version = 2.4!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sufi,,Thomas!Sample_contact_email = dkumar2@kumc.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 9139076900!Sample_contact_laboratory = Sufi Thomas lab!Sample_contact_department = Otolaryngology!Sample_contact_institute = KUMC!Sample_contact_address = 3901 Rainbow Blvd!Sample_contact_city = Kansas City!Sample_contact_state = Kansas!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 66160!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1922nnn/GSM1922916/suppl/GSM1922916_3-M1B_052814_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1922nnn/GSM1922916/suppl/GSM1922916_M1B_052814_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE74555!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	NC	0.381974	AB	1957.359497	3000.917480SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.196114	AA	618.065613	680.422363SNP_A-1969580	NC	0.373652	AB	1331.499756	3988.996338SNP_A-4263484	NC	0.510557	AB	948.647949	2426.868896SNP_A-1978185	NC	0.871681	BB	1860.614868	444.292114SNP_A-4264431	NC	0.196036	AA	1287.024780	1221.916992SNP_A-1980898	NC	0.526728	AA	351.215546	1311.784058SNP_A-1983139	NC	0.400734	AB	2444.750488	834.021606SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.647337	AB	2655.204590	619.899597SNP_A-1995832	NC	0.196067	AA	1789.546509	1872.536011SNP_A-1995893	NC	0.196067	AA	1209.537354	1946.813965SNP_A-1997689	NC	0.671223	AA	751.490662	3075.195312SNP_A-1997709	NC	0.521542	AB	2064.649658	407.611694SNP_A-1997896	NC	0.915425	AB	1858.780884	718.936768SNP_A-1997922	NC	0.196010	AA	963.778564	989.454834SNP_A-2000230	NC	0.764466	BB	2242.091309	1137.093628SNP_A-2000332	NC	0.196028	AA	2116.460693	2711.600830SNP_A-2000337	NC	0.364679	BB	1520.403931	505.273315SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.876635	AB	2942.228760	1204.493774SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.606247	BB	1285.190796	263.182526!sample_table_end
