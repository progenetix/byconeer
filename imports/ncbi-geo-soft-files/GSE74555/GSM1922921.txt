DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = M5B!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Operating Software (GCOS version 1.4). Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-name = birdseed-v2!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-version = 2.4!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sufi,,Thomas!Sample_contact_email = dkumar2@kumc.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 9139076900!Sample_contact_laboratory = Sufi Thomas lab!Sample_contact_department = Otolaryngology!Sample_contact_institute = KUMC!Sample_contact_address = 3901 Rainbow Blvd!Sample_contact_city = Kansas City!Sample_contact_state = Kansas!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 66160!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1922nnn/GSM1922921/suppl/GSM1922921_3-M5B_052814_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1922nnn/GSM1922921/suppl/GSM1922921_M5B_052814_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE74555!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	NC	0.584065	AB	3262.108643	745.869446SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.267649	AA	407.407898	973.789673SNP_A-1969580	NC	0.184249	BB	803.419312	2693.447754SNP_A-4263484	NC	0.620507	AB	716.809631	1797.151489SNP_A-1978185	NC	0.497904	BB	1421.083130	498.576019SNP_A-4264431	NC	0.910408	AB	2038.177124	569.231262SNP_A-1980898	NC	0.235962	AA	496.866608	1014.245544SNP_A-1983139	NC	0.521412	AB	1765.242676	576.068909SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.677438	AB	2103.134277	792.023315SNP_A-1995832	NC	0.196066	AA	1593.162842	1303.134399SNP_A-1995893	NC	0.196087	AA	1032.479126	1424.501953SNP_A-1997689	NC	0.592480	AA	920.798218	3069.516113SNP_A-1997709	NC	0.478459	AB	1862.678589	457.550354SNP_A-1997896	NC	0.196029	AA	1080.342285	1690.598755SNP_A-1997922	NC	0.368743	BB	1145.299683	463.248383SNP_A-2000230	NC	0.196450	BB	2043.875122	1713.960571SNP_A-2000332	NC	0.693590	AA	1361.254028	2792.023438SNP_A-2000337	NC	0.196066	BB	1144.160034	797.721313SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.953652	BB	2627.351074	996.011902SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.196043	AA	616.524719	601.140076!sample_table_end
