DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = M1A!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Operating Software (GCOS version 1.4). Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-name = birdseed-v2!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-version = 2.4!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sufi,,Thomas!Sample_contact_email = dkumar2@kumc.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 9139076900!Sample_contact_laboratory = Sufi Thomas lab!Sample_contact_department = Otolaryngology!Sample_contact_institute = KUMC!Sample_contact_address = 3901 Rainbow Blvd!Sample_contact_city = Kansas City!Sample_contact_state = Kansas!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 66160!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1922nnn/GSM1922915/suppl/GSM1922915_2-M1A_052814_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1922nnn/GSM1922915/suppl/GSM1922915_M1A_052814_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE74555!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	NC	0.385692	AB	1956.911133	2775.610352SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.196128	AA	519.512695	591.463928SNP_A-1969580	NC	0.352921	AB	1216.667114	3375.203613SNP_A-4263484	NC	0.558874	AB	771.138733	2269.512695SNP_A-1978185	NC	0.871575	BB	1878.049316	478.049286SNP_A-4264431	NC	0.196035	AA	1344.715942	1206.911011SNP_A-1980898	NC	0.384372	AA	319.106201	1127.236328SNP_A-1983139	NC	0.484963	AB	2113.821533	644.309448SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.662716	AB	2410.569580	670.325684SNP_A-1995832	NC	0.196056	AA	1687.398804	1584.146851SNP_A-1995893	NC	0.196070	AA	1312.602173	1901.626465SNP_A-1997689	NC	0.834437	AA	750.407043	3423.984131SNP_A-1997709	NC	0.181466	AA	2123.577637	354.065552SNP_A-1997896	NC	0.822951	AB	2050.000488	656.098083SNP_A-1997922	NC	0.196015	AA	972.764709	1055.285034SNP_A-2000230	NC	0.586385	BB	2322.764648	1439.024902SNP_A-2000332	NC	0.196023	AA	2313.008545	2657.724121SNP_A-2000337	NC	0.407679	BB	1531.301270	423.984222SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.787803	AB	3132.927490	1084.553345SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.195373	AA	1321.951660	248.374481!sample_table_end
