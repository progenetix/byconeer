DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = N1!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Operating Software (GCOS version 1.4). Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-name = birdseed-v2!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-version = 2.4!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sufi,,Thomas!Sample_contact_email = dkumar2@kumc.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 9139076900!Sample_contact_laboratory = Sufi Thomas lab!Sample_contact_department = Otolaryngology!Sample_contact_institute = KUMC!Sample_contact_address = 3901 Rainbow Blvd!Sample_contact_city = Kansas City!Sample_contact_state = Kansas!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 66160!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1922nnn/GSM1922914/suppl/GSM1922914_1-N1_052814_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1922nnn/GSM1922914/suppl/GSM1922914_N1_052814_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE74555!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	NC	0.199649	AA	2072.176758	2069.422119SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.196110	AA	528.375183	652.342102SNP_A-1969580	NC	0.427433	AB	926.722290	2937.741455SNP_A-4263484	NC	0.621436	AB	677.135498	1883.747070SNP_A-1978185	NC	0.812053	BB	1828.650635	536.088623SNP_A-4264431	NC	0.196011	BB	1222.589966	1030.854492SNP_A-1980898	NC	0.231184	AA	446.281494	965.840698SNP_A-1983139	NC	0.490350	AB	2244.077637	646.832458SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.008266	AA	2220.937256	762.534973SNP_A-1995832	NC	0.194451	AB	1534.986694	1307.989502SNP_A-1995893	NC	0.196071	AA	1099.724976	1737.741577SNP_A-1997689	NC	0.613003	AA	790.083130	2988.430176SNP_A-1997709	NC	0.481380	AB	1457.851685	431.405457SNP_A-1997896	NC	0.885067	BB	1624.242920	695.868286SNP_A-1997922	NC	0.196006	AA	896.970215	875.482605SNP_A-2000230	NC	0.472250	BB	2204.408203	1410.468750SNP_A-2000332	NC	0.196049	BB	1791.185059	1847.934448SNP_A-2000337	NC	0.206312	BB	1198.898560	564.187805SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.913701	AB	2865.565186	1165.289795SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.599683	BB	1282.645142	256.198853!sample_table_end
