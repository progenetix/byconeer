DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = P5C!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Operating Software (GCOS version 1.4). Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-name = birdseed-v2!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-version = 2.4!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sufi,,Thomas!Sample_contact_email = dkumar2@kumc.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 9139076900!Sample_contact_laboratory = Sufi Thomas lab!Sample_contact_department = Otolaryngology!Sample_contact_institute = KUMC!Sample_contact_address = 3901 Rainbow Blvd!Sample_contact_city = Kansas City!Sample_contact_state = Kansas!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 66160!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1922nnn/GSM1922924/suppl/GSM1922924_6-P5C_052814_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1922nnn/GSM1922924/suppl/GSM1922924_P5C_052814_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE74555!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	NC	0.671877	AB	2745.789795	579.318970SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.197005	AA	271.445862	652.566101SNP_A-1969580	NC	0.399022	AB	1003.134094	3005.092529SNP_A-4263484	NC	0.559412	AB	829.221008	1985.507812SNP_A-1978185	NC	0.724526	BB	1732.472168	558.559082SNP_A-4264431	NC	0.628630	BB	1584.411011	488.445465SNP_A-1980898	NC	0.234055	AA	285.938599	864.081970SNP_A-1983139	NC	0.301332	AB	1605.170898	733.647217SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.193026	AA	2196.631836	699.177917SNP_A-1995832	NC	0.196033	BB	1598.903687	1200.157227SNP_A-1995893	NC	0.196074	AA	1099.099609	1673.325928SNP_A-1997689	NC	0.627501	AA	624.364014	2886.408691SNP_A-1997709	NC	0.615695	AB	1778.692261	325.108215SNP_A-1997896	NC	0.196085	BB	1247.944092	1544.066284SNP_A-1997922	NC	0.431981	BB	1172.346680	399.922150SNP_A-2000230	NC	0.196098	BB	1764.982788	1470.427490SNP_A-2000332	NC	0.629377	AA	1730.121948	3045.828857SNP_A-2000337	NC	0.233694	BB	1209.949585	453.192810SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.883261	BB	2607.912842	1126.126587SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.195990	BB	708.578674	600.862244!sample_table_end
