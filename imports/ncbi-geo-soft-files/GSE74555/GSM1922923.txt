DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = P5B!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Operating Software (GCOS version 1.4). Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-name = birdseed-v2!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-version = 2.4!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sufi,,Thomas!Sample_contact_email = dkumar2@kumc.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 9139076900!Sample_contact_laboratory = Sufi Thomas lab!Sample_contact_department = Otolaryngology!Sample_contact_institute = KUMC!Sample_contact_address = 3901 Rainbow Blvd!Sample_contact_city = Kansas City!Sample_contact_state = Kansas!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 66160!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1922nnn/GSM1922923/suppl/GSM1922923_5-P5B_052814_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1922nnn/GSM1922923/suppl/GSM1922923_P5B_052814_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE74555!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	NC	0.609651	AB	3046.501465	702.578735SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.196102	AA	374.309875	659.761108SNP_A-1969580	NC	0.371955	AB	976.519836	2697.053955SNP_A-4263484	NC	0.618850	AB	725.599060	1787.293335SNP_A-1978185	NC	0.780435	BB	1824.586182	588.398315SNP_A-4264431	NC	0.668468	BB	1610.037354	524.862427SNP_A-1980898	NC	0.254548	AA	343.462738	944.291443SNP_A-1983139	NC	0.451192	AB	1626.151489	617.864197SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.007095	AA	1952.118408	672.192017SNP_A-1995832	NC	0.196033	BB	1467.772095	1130.755615SNP_A-1995893	NC	0.196098	AA	1085.635864	1355.893677SNP_A-1997689	NC	0.807342	AA	889.042908	3462.247314SNP_A-1997709	NC	0.485391	AB	1686.464600	442.449860SNP_A-1997896	NC	0.196103	BB	1167.127563	1636.280396SNP_A-1997922	NC	0.415406	BB	1148.711304	376.151520SNP_A-2000230	NC	0.207876	BB	1983.886353	1531.768433SNP_A-2000332	NC	0.391220	AA	1736.188354	2866.483154SNP_A-2000337	NC	0.222709	BB	1164.825562	445.672699SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.771866	BB	2528.085205	1177.256470SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.196004	BB	628.453552	494.475616!sample_table_end
