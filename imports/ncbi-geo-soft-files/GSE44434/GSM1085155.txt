In brief, normal and tumor tissues were carefully dissected, and proteinase K was immediately added for cell digestion. After protein precipitation, DNA was precipitated using isopropanol, followed by a 70% ethanol washing procedure. Purified DNA was dissolved and eluted in DNA hydration solution and stored at -80Â°C.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction enzyme digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to 250K_Nsp!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Operating Software (GCOS version 1.4). Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Partek. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Li,,Zhang!Sample_contact_phone = 713 563 4298!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics and COmputational Biology!Sample_contact_institute = The University Of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 1400 Pressler st, unit 1410!Sample_contact_city = Houston!Sample_contact_state = TX!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 77030!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1085nnn/GSM1085155/suppl/GSM1085155_MEC-190D8.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE44434!Sample_data_row_count = 261563
