After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from germ cell tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8887!Sample_contact_name = Yu Hsuan,,Wu!Sample_contact_email = allenwu03@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = National Yang-Ming University!Sample_contact_address = No.155, Sec.2, Linong Street!Sample_contact_city = Taipei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 112!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE19349!Sample_series_id = GSE19350!Sample_data_row_count = 620901#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200003	AB	0.9299463	0.4779997	1.180896	0.5393371	-0.1081429200006	AB	0.7485044	0.3538192	1.8268	0.3743339	-0.1998014200047	AB	0.8468944	0.2862504	0.3842363	0.3789076	-0.3195082200050	AB	0.8331156	0.4530145	1.635319	0.5083615	-0.1903928200052	AB	0.9466458	0.5646423	1.198004	0.5064251	0.1440221200053	AB	0.705011	0.3727948	0.7906865	0.3942961	-0.6003715200070	AB	0.9705294	0.5425658	0.3640196	0.5444153	-0.5121444200078	AB	0.6531293	0.5677024	3.355963	0.5486953	0.4980108200087	AA	0.9078211	0.02463312	1.350904	0	0.3981895200091	AB	0.8204677	0.5546901	2.423325	0.5433113	0.2207182200096	BB	0.9354096	0.9418816	1.00253	0.9849448	0.04642063200124	AB	0.8902165	0.5870268	0.734273	0.4727673	-0.4327233200199	BB	0.9598788	1	0.6606613	1	-0.07758319200240	AA	0.8782917	0.04797136	0.9880634	0.02392293	-0.4559208200251	AB	0.9409742	0.4767959	1.061239	0.4421072	-0.2382587200258	AA	0.7451698	0.04483231	1.923442	0	0.2038299200260	AB	0.7948331	0.802493	1.628859	0.6028536	0.4241842200261	AB	0.8794336	0.5024129	1.616167	0.4496651	0.1634505200262	AB	0.9256892	0.4616235	0.4707488	0.5034506	-0.6459956200519	BB	0.8716854	0.9875923	2.002836	0.9991461	0.3648997!sample_table_end
