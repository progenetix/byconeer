After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from germ cell tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8887!Sample_contact_name = Yu Hsuan,,Wu!Sample_contact_email = allenwu03@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = National Yang-Ming University!Sample_contact_address = No.155, Sec.2, Linong Street!Sample_contact_city = Taipei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 112!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE19349!Sample_series_id = GSE19350!Sample_data_row_count = 620901#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200003	AB	0.9299463	0.3970677	1.230907	0.4522701	-0.05998398200006	BB	0.787675	0.9790798	1.643471	0.9993172	0.04267953200047	AB	0.8612435	0.3452323	0.6209372	0.4733655	0.4053733200050	AB	0.8331156	0.3968781	1.808882	0.4469512	-0.02963638200052	AB	0.9466458	0.5201212	1.26487	0.4650573	0.2559884200053	AB	0.7493879	0.4585918	1.153429	0.508162	-0.08167957200070	AB	0.9705294	0.4092141	0.407202	0.4102915	-0.3413229200078	BB	0.6531293	0.9544302	2.424409	1	0.382977200087	AA	0.9078211	0.04933889	1.411514	0.01087608	0.44308200091	AB	0.8204677	0.5153471	2.423441	0.4998488	0.1897308200096	AB	0.9354096	0.4083151	1.082129	0.4488053	-0.1847808200124	AA	0.8902165	0.02147079	0.54533	0	-0.4659289200199	AB	0.9598788	0.4204649	0.5658027	0.4334744	-0.5505072200240	AB	0.8782917	0.467507	1.47027	0.5111722	-0.09565635200251	AB	0.9409742	0.522459	1.061126	0.4855477	-0.2672894200258	AA	0.7451698	0.04767202	1.824817	0	0.1258706200260	BB	0.7948331	0.9978772	1.554511	0.9974524	0.2777637200261	AB	0.8794336	0.5311502	1.528472	0.4789286	0.06658885200262	AA	0.9256892	0.01804774	0.4619396	0.004736662	-0.48648200519	AB	0.8716854	0.4771216	2.162496	0.4854274	0.005582919!sample_table_end
