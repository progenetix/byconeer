After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from germ cell tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8887!Sample_contact_name = Yu Hsuan,,Wu!Sample_contact_email = allenwu03@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = National Yang-Ming University!Sample_contact_address = No.155, Sec.2, Linong Street!Sample_contact_city = Taipei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 112!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE19349!Sample_series_id = GSE19350!Sample_data_row_count = 620901#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200003	AA	0.9299463	0.0183083	1.159949	0	0.05626478200006	AB	0.787675	0.4392115	2.410822	0.4794802	0.1501509200047	AA	0.8612435	0.05167496	0.6558181	0.003241681	0.3295897200050	BB	0.8331156	1	1.218138	1	0.0144382200052	BB	0.9466458	0.9970863	1.115004	1	0.2686228200053	AA	0.7493879	0.06393624	1.228284	0	0.1610856200070	AA	0.9705294	0	0.4229504	0	-0.195819200078	BB	0.6531293	0.9707499	2.792886	1	0.6041356200087	AA	0.9078211	0.02505177	1.665379	0	0.6998012200091	AB	0.8204677	0.5072134	2.390822	0.491627	0.1756543200096	AB	0.9354096	0.4119577	1.060207	0.4529219	-0.2157775200124	AA	0.8902165	0.02333405	0.6321563	0	-0.2542777200199	AA	0.9598788	0.006408827	0.5492679	0.002337918	-0.4218656200240	AB	0.8782917	0.4416643	1.299216	0.4839661	-0.2782155200251	AA	0.9409742	0.008681787	0.9396355	0	-0.07874443200258	AB	0.7451698	0.4091842	1.961417	0.4593254	-0.006594417200260	AB	0.7948331	0.8059583	1.530247	0.609852	0.3326474200261	AB	0.8794336	0.5341433	1.143933	0.4819765	-0.3531942200262	AA	0.9256892	0.01781568	0.4528742	0.004475449	-0.5149677200519	AA	0.8716854	0.004561022	1.934388	0	0.2055968!sample_table_end
