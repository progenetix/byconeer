After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from germ cell tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8887!Sample_contact_name = Yu Hsuan,,Wu!Sample_contact_email = allenwu03@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = National Yang-Ming University!Sample_contact_address = No.155, Sec.2, Linong Street!Sample_contact_city = Taipei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 112!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE19349!Sample_series_id = GSE19350!Sample_data_row_count = 620901#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200003	AA	0.9299463	0.0204072	0.8916968	0	-0.3243719200006	BB	0.787675	0.9791858	1.320545	0.9994183	-0.2728249200047	AA	0.8612435	0.04128397	0.6600935	0	0.3337833200050	BB	0.8331156	0.9982975	1.131671	1	-0.09423989200052	BB	0.9466458	0.9938015	1.054627	1	0.1864301200053	AA	0.7493879	0.05845938	1.017004	0	-0.108897200070	AA	0.9705294	0	0.5414627	0	0.1605542200078	BB	0.6531293	0.9502199	2.484938	1	0.4141919200087	AA	0.9078211	0.05099607	1.214517	0.01250047	0.224991200091	AB	0.8190723	0.630469	2.214075	0.6270519	0.1526528200096	AB	0.6929497	0.294822	1.04337	0.3205429	-0.190832200124	AA	0.8902165	0.02950715	0.5324968	0.003733414	-0.5067459200199	BB	0.9598788	0.9941453	0.7465418	0.9950701	0.09530639200240	AB	0.7761092	0.3269732	1.21682	0.3499458	-0.3127533200251	AA	0.9409742	0.01389126	1.063706	0.001734194	0.09599091200258	AB	0.6585534	0.5640188	1.680693	0.6150815	-0.1429042200260	NC	0.09541614	0.6089822	1.342079	0.4007849	0.3113787200261	AB	0.65201	0.705665	1.356657	0.6826956	-0.01594632200262	AA	0.9256892	0.01661562	0.5423595	0.003124651	-0.2542791200519	AB	0.8702452	0.37869	2.076231	0.3837055	0.01493122!sample_table_end
