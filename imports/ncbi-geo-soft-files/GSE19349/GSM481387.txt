After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from germ cell tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8887!Sample_contact_name = Yu Hsuan,,Wu!Sample_contact_email = allenwu03@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = National Yang-Ming University!Sample_contact_address = No.155, Sec.2, Linong Street!Sample_contact_city = Taipei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 112!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE19349!Sample_series_id = GSE19350!Sample_data_row_count = 620901#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200003	AA	0.9299463	0.02053286	1.332682	0	0.2552639200006	BB	0.787675	0.9869682	1.508112	1	-0.07323729200047	AA	0.8612435	0.03178584	0.7640281	0	0.5400191200050	BB	0.8331156	0.9977475	0.9542469	1	-0.3410526200052	BB	0.9466458	0.9946818	1.255515	1	0.4384788200053	AA	0.7493879	0.05867828	1.266766	0	0.2078349200070	AB	0.9705294	0.5533144	0.3849932	0.5551806	-0.4289145200078	AB	0.6531293	0.5128356	3.060699	0.4850823	0.3470579200087	AB	0.9078211	0.4961487	1.821361	0.448845	0.5127266200091	AB	0.8204677	0.5224889	2.531228	0.5077269	0.2579202200096	BB	0.9354096	0.9614233	0.7086637	1	-0.4376132200124	AB	0.8902165	0.6100395	0.708158	0.4921276	-0.4989908200199	BB	0.9598788	0.9999082	0.6489012	1	-0.1035489200240	AA	0.8782917	0.0234033	1.302555	0	-0.04254525200251	BB	0.9409742	0.9836008	0.981945	0.9980052	-0.1031818200258	AB	0.7451698	0.4514754	2.479314	0.5096522	0.3208436200260	AB	0.6361061	0.8471074	1.623673	0.6929569	0.4011553200261	BB	0.8794336	0.9721589	1.546313	0.9992121	0.3668971200262	AA	0.9256892	0.03111682	0.4600777	0.01944735	-0.4982781200519	AA	0.8716854	0.007601129	2.230968	0.0002115766	0.4087551!sample_table_end
