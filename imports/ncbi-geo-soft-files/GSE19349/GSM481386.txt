After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from germ cell tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8887!Sample_contact_name = Yu Hsuan,,Wu!Sample_contact_email = allenwu03@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = National Yang-Ming University!Sample_contact_address = No.155, Sec.2, Linong Street!Sample_contact_city = Taipei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 112!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE19349!Sample_series_id = GSE19350!Sample_data_row_count = 620901#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200003	AA	0.9299463	0.0200923	1.061292	0	-0.07299467200006	BB	0.787675	0.9844301	1.50686	1	-0.07704228200047	AA	0.8612435	0.05740147	0.6323593	0.01241253	0.2799019200050	BB	0.8331156	0.9902318	1.243246	0.9965453	0.02984073200052	BB	0.9466458	0.9856861	1.049353	0.9966768	0.1745704200053	AA	0.7493879	0.0622733	1.104593	0	0.008665411200070	AA	0.9705294	0.002105744	0.4982376	0	0.04004418200078	BB	0.6531293	0.9517573	2.380919	1	0.3540916200087	AA	0.9078211	0.03979304	1.211809	0.001519119	0.2300911200091	AB	0.8204677	0.4698092	2.114353	0.4538176	0.0238068200096	AB	0.9354096	0.4726486	1.141546	0.5189043	-0.1133794200124	AB	0.8902165	0.5678005	0.9493092	0.4565925	-0.0503414200199	BB	0.9598788	1	0.5589686	1	-0.3187267200240	AA	0.8782917	0.02409185	1.310685	0	-0.03398239200251	AA	0.9409742	0.01523949	0.9294431	0.003016808	-0.09975358200258	AB	0.7451698	0.5170912	1.846534	0.5711203	-0.0484418200260	AB	0.7207458	0.6652917	1.300362	0.4399673	0.2066978200261	AB	0.8794336	0.6460844	1.254953	0.6119314	-0.1684047200262	AB	0.872268	0.3354647	0.4957327	0.3620245	-0.5230882200519	AB	0.8716854	0.4743736	2.284617	0.4825876	0.08669555!sample_table_end
