After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from germ cell tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8887!Sample_contact_name = Yu Hsuan,,Wu!Sample_contact_email = allenwu03@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = National Yang-Ming University!Sample_contact_address = No.155, Sec.2, Linong Street!Sample_contact_city = Taipei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 112!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE19349!Sample_series_id = GSE19350!Sample_data_row_count = 620901#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200003	AA	0.9299463	0.01675017	1.095457	0	-0.02537159200006	BB	0.787675	0.9862651	1.591166	1	0.003381169200047	AA	0.8612435	0.0392906	0.6396511	0	0.2874065200050	BB	0.8331156	0.996254	0.9285176	1	-0.3826354200052	BB	0.9466458	0.9896954	1.036478	1	0.1590435200053	AA	0.7493879	0.06253652	1.078922	0	-0.0253708200070	AB	0.9705294	0.4387048	0.4099867	0.4400152	-0.3378156200078	BB	0.6531293	0.9626134	2.529862	1	0.4529194200087	AA	0.9078211	0.02039515	1.2597	0	0.3005302200091	BB	0.8204677	0.9701294	1.949767	1	0.2867358200096	AA	0.9354096	0.004260137	1.007753	0	-0.114377200124	AB	0.8890577	0.6057344	0.5855063	0.4885058	-0.7707646200199	AB	0.9598788	0.5077893	0.5571884	0.5227576	-0.5859813200240	AA	0.8782917	0.02138456	1.345169	0	0.005112745200251	BB	0.9409742	0.986569	1.055883	1	0.003657215200258	AB	0.7451698	0.4476777	2.052364	0.5060945	0.04502304200260	AB	0.7948331	0.7547175	1.371695	0.5063658	0.1962812200261	BB	0.8794336	0.9737222	1.203874	1	0.006968391200262	AA	0.9256892	0.01945264	0.5176325	0.006318032	-0.3228991200519	BB	0.8716854	0.9937718	1.771083	1	0.1945854!sample_table_end
