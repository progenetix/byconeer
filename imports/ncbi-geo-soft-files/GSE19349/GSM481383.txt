After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from germ cell tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8887!Sample_contact_name = Yu Hsuan,,Wu!Sample_contact_email = allenwu03@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = National Yang-Ming University!Sample_contact_address = No.155, Sec.2, Linong Street!Sample_contact_city = Taipei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 112!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE19349!Sample_series_id = GSE19350!Sample_data_row_count = 620901#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200003	AA	0.9299463	0.02927926	1.046674	0.002838665	-0.09824868200006	AB	0.787675	0.4239852	2.138264	0.4607316	-0.01410118200047	AA	0.8612435	0.05648542	0.7065033	0.0109455	0.4393952200050	BB	0.8331156	0.9834359	1.144127	0.9903696	-0.09970539200052	BB	0.9466458	0.9830857	1.034559	0.993649	0.1526075200053	AA	0.7493879	0.06769116	1.086298	0	-0.0177389200070	BB	0.9705294	0.99173	0.3613434	0.9942785	-0.4183426200078	BB	0.6531293	0.9469591	2.317932	1	0.3104505200087	AA	0.9078211	0.03563659	1.169571	0	0.182008200091	BB	0.8204677	0.9583444	1.991057	0.9893754	0.3046992200096	AA	0.9354096	0.005749412	1.128957	0	0.04879366200124	AA	0.8902165	0.02163888	0.4807904	0	-0.6477858200199	AB	0.9598788	0.4532717	0.7118042	0.4676345	-0.2320763200240	AB	0.8782917	0.4243898	1.316884	0.4637802	-0.2498519200251	AA	0.9409742	0.007597704	0.8130046	0	-0.2867084200258	AA	0.7451698	0.04884298	1.619831	0.001127296	-0.04687095200260	BB	0.7948331	0.9991679	1.489897	1	0.2160075200261	AA	0.8794336	0.06878418	1.201433	0.008096616	0.008366042200262	AB	0.9256892	0.4371389	0.4386254	0.4764701	-0.7413444200519	BB	0.8716854	0.9909714	1.655838	1	0.09429374!sample_table_end
