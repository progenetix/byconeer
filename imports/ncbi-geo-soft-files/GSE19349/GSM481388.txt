After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from germ cell tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8887!Sample_contact_name = Yu Hsuan,,Wu!Sample_contact_email = allenwu03@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = National Yang-Ming University!Sample_contact_address = No.155, Sec.2, Linong Street!Sample_contact_city = Taipei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 112!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE19349!Sample_series_id = GSE19350!Sample_data_row_count = 620901#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200003	AB	0.9299463	0.3768852	1.071211	0.4276074	-0.2503877200006	AB	0.787675	0.4442646	2.140165	0.4857022	-0.02457208200047	AA	0.8612435	0.03658727	0.6663623	0	0.3450842200050	BB	0.8331156	0.996447	1.047249	1	-0.208754200052	BB	0.9466458	0.9894961	1.085855	1	0.226073200053	AA	0.7493879	0.06399157	0.9389761	0	-0.2264217200070	BB	0.9705294	1	0.3050636	1	-0.6606072200078	BB	0.6531293	0.9764137	2.726402	1	0.5753358200087	AA	0.9078211	0.02480398	1.546364	0	0.5930167200091	BB	0.8204677	0.9765515	2.113899	1	0.4100704200096	AA	0.9354096	0.01658019	1.074932	0.006092523	-0.02687119200124	AB	0.8902165	0.636586	0.8965942	0.5244109	-0.1579409200199	BB	0.9598788	1	0.651517	1	-0.09769113200240	AB	0.8313097	0.5725051	1.1093	0.6079492	-0.4018881200251	AB	0.9409742	0.552164	1.128656	0.5162072	-0.1793067200258	AA	0.7451698	0.05042015	1.844099	0.003132777	0.1390812200260	AB	0.7935019	0.8193443	1.349802	0.6368865	0.1460818200261	AB	0.8794336	0.5336907	1.226459	0.4815156	-0.2524415200262	AA	0.9256892	0.0196345	0.5172659	0.006522739	-0.3240047200519	AA	0.8716854	0.002159893	2.029035	0	0.276598!sample_table_end
