After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from germ cell tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8887!Sample_contact_name = Yu Hsuan,,Wu!Sample_contact_email = allenwu03@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = National Yang-Ming University!Sample_contact_address = No.155, Sec.2, Linong Street!Sample_contact_city = Taipei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 112!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE19349!Sample_series_id = GSE19350!Sample_data_row_count = 620901#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200003	AA	0.9299463	0.02328279	1.119392	0	0.002075712200006	BB	0.787675	0.9805883	1.369012	1	-0.2193888200047	AA	0.8612435	0.05169476	0.5397995	0.003273396	0.04872749200050	BB	0.8331156	0.9872383	0.9303368	0.993825	-0.3927187200052	BB	0.9466458	0.9907138	1.145538	1	0.3039605200053	AA	0.7493879	0.05687244	0.9555295	0	-0.198172200070	AB	0.9705294	0.4050315	0.3775996	0.4060759	-0.4493109200078	AB	0.6531293	0.6054726	3.122573	0.5944021	0.425013200087	AA	0.9078211	0.02903225	1.211267	0	0.2374828200091	AB	0.8204677	0.5307273	2.300569	0.5168309	0.1265922200096	AB	0.9354096	0.4541721	1.149388	0.5005535	-0.1156006200124	AB	0.878409	0.6052406	0.5441552	0.4880903	-0.8761309200199	AB	0.9598788	0.4735348	0.7117059	0.4887335	-0.2400948200240	AB	0.8782917	0.4814892	1.299405	0.5240596	-0.2609384200251	AA	0.9409742	0.01123027	0.8488702	0	-0.2273537200258	AB	0.7451698	0.4431889	2.007064	0.5018895	0.009089141200260	AB	0.7948331	0.7322121	1.382436	0.4865331	0.2277431200261	AB	0.8794336	0.5853314	1.413631	0.5397747	-0.03634258200262	AA	0.9256892	0.01666458	0.4457454	0.003179759	-0.537331200519	BB	0.8716854	0.9955449	1.820127	1	0.2360351!sample_table_end
