After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from germ cell tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8887!Sample_contact_name = Yu Hsuan,,Wu!Sample_contact_email = allenwu03@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = National Yang-Ming University!Sample_contact_address = No.155, Sec.2, Linong Street!Sample_contact_city = Taipei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 112!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE19349!Sample_series_id = GSE19350!Sample_data_row_count = 620901#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200003	AA	0.9299463	0.02549956	0.9101761	0	-0.2976877200006	BB	0.787675	0.9792653	1.441155	0.9994942	-0.1466519200047	AA	0.8612435	0.03881274	0.6552359	0	0.321898200050	BB	0.8331156	0.9893606	1.107719	0.9957536	-0.1379243200052	BB	0.9466458	0.9987904	1.024974	1	0.1481352200053	AA	0.7493879	0.06740313	0.9332815	0	-0.2366513200070	BB	0.9705294	0.9836335	0.4041994	0.9861693	-0.2585972200078	BB	0.6531293	0.962262	2.357586	1	0.3508043200087	AA	0.9078211	0.02725911	1.278527	0	0.3167777200091	BB	0.8204677	0.9685519	1.997263	1	0.3198098200096	AA	0.9354096	0.00873786	0.8682291	0	-0.3314084200124	AA	0.8902165	0.02370723	0.5993385	0	-0.331488200199	AB	0.9598788	0.5203026	0.6657724	0.5349096	-0.3229996200240	AA	0.8782917	0.009878342	1.192909	0	-0.1612444200251	AB	0.9409742	0.5812401	1.065042	0.5486774	-0.2459147200258	AB	0.7451698	0.4852546	1.977322	0.5412962	0.02292499200260	BB	0.7948331	1	1.570998	1	0.2921492200261	AB	0.8794336	0.6097885	1.219058	0.5688225	-0.234127200262	AB	0.9244187	0.3607866	0.4877259	0.3905272	-0.5570744200519	BB	0.8716854	0.9892635	1.810812	1	0.2214085!sample_table_end
