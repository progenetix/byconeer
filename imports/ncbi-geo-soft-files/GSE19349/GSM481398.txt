After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from germ cell tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8887!Sample_contact_name = Yu Hsuan,,Wu!Sample_contact_email = allenwu03@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = National Yang-Ming University!Sample_contact_address = No.155, Sec.2, Linong Street!Sample_contact_city = Taipei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 112!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE19349!Sample_series_id = GSE19350!Sample_data_row_count = 620901#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200003	AA	0.9299463	0.02923185	1.067666	0.002780727	-0.06957333200006	BB	0.787675	0.979089	1.590124	0.9993259	-0.004917962200047	AB	0.8612435	0.3022925	0.6044359	0.4045985	0.3428351200050	AB	0.8331156	0.3813494	1.725163	0.4293996	-0.09004357200052	AB	0.9466458	0.5849382	1.165411	0.5300571	0.1141676200053	AB	0.7493879	0.4039816	1.066651	0.4365931	-0.1805915200070	AB	0.4774253	0.2444704	0.464489	0.2442464	-0.1155682200078	AB	0.4441709	0.66642	2.778521	0.6681564	0.3080558200087	AA	0.9078211	0.03927889	1.09624	0.001015143	0.08587568200091	BB	0.8204677	0.9685575	1.714193	1	0.09932116200096	AB	0.6627435	0.292028	1.171583	0.3173853	-0.02245934200124	AB	0.4718952	0.4886818	0.5445794	0.390031	-0.8023887200199	BB	0.9598788	0.9970313	0.5438817	0.9978728	-0.3599377200240	AB	0.5724859	0.3044584	1.231155	0.3236364	-0.2837823200251	AA	0.9409742	0.01156362	1.013633	0	0.02829747200258	AB	0.7221332	0.5487422	1.761471	0.6007707	-0.08875542200260	AB	0.2178808	0.6248723	1.160104	0.4118419	0.08423194200261	AB	0.2248796	0.7458943	1.199375	0.7304762	-0.1660444200262	AA	0.9256892	0.02656631	0.421569	0.01432525	-0.6223103200519	AB	0.8285523	0.6274135	2.081023	0.6369525	0.05718909!sample_table_end
