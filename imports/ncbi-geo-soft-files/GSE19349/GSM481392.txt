After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from germ cell tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8887!Sample_contact_name = Yu Hsuan,,Wu!Sample_contact_email = allenwu03@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = National Yang-Ming University!Sample_contact_address = No.155, Sec.2, Linong Street!Sample_contact_city = Taipei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 112!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE19349!Sample_series_id = GSE19350!Sample_data_row_count = 620901#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200003	AB	0.9299463	0.3810974	1.141405	0.4327546	-0.160928200006	AB	0.787675	0.4360144	1.912401	0.4755435	-0.1821388200047	AA	0.8612435	0.03705049	0.6818795	0	0.3785243200050	BB	0.8331156	0.9970162	1.115518	1	-0.1168265200052	BB	0.9466458	0.992282	1.006575	1	0.1182837200053	AA	0.7493879	0.06408321	0.8683524	0	-0.3392687200070	AB	0.9705294	0.4632533	0.4369	0.4647576	-0.2513341200078	BB	0.6531293	0.9553668	2.306642	1	0.3121106200087	AA	0.9078211	0.03090762	1.237897	0	0.267453200091	BB	0.8204677	0.9693907	1.924694	1	0.267291200096	AA	0.9354096	0.01385251	0.9272012	0.003009881	-0.2389251200124	AA	0.8902165	0.02506685	0.6058357	0	-0.3170263200199	BB	0.9598788	1	0.6652732	1	-0.06754715200240	AB	0.8782917	0.4320667	1.354969	0.4727509	-0.2126716200251	AB	0.9409742	0.4949118	0.9505274	0.4593413	-0.4087338200258	AA	0.7451698	0.05228025	1.644958	0.005498026	-0.02710407200260	AB	0.7948331	0.7722175	1.311993	0.541709	0.124724200261	AB	0.8794336	0.5354787	1.357015	0.4833363	-0.1075157200262	AA	0.9256892	0.01512782	0.6533417	0.001449967	0.01499079200519	AA	0.8716854	0.006700533	1.813008	0	0.1102505!sample_table_end
