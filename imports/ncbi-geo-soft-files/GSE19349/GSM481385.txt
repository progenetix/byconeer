After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from germ cell tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8887!Sample_contact_name = Yu Hsuan,,Wu!Sample_contact_email = allenwu03@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = National Yang-Ming University!Sample_contact_address = No.155, Sec.2, Linong Street!Sample_contact_city = Taipei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 112!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE19349!Sample_series_id = GSE19350!Sample_data_row_count = 620901#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200003	AA	0.9299463	0.03175672	0.9655631	0.005866082	-0.2160286200006	AB	0.787675	0.5102303	1.84952	0.5518726	-0.2007159200047	AA	0.8612435	0.0520118	0.6700384	0.003781128	0.3607061200050	BB	0.8331156	0.9971104	1.116272	1	-0.1157157200052	BB	0.9466458	0.9849547	1.073372	0.9958252	0.2068053200053	AA	0.7493879	0.06685716	1.15865	0	0.07564171200070	AB	0.9705294	0.4875397	0.368965	0.4892359	-0.5003226200078	AB	0.6531293	0.5596954	2.792723	0.5390058	0.2264707200087	AB	0.9078211	0.5304542	1.286552	0.4824717	-0.009313535200091	BB	0.8204677	0.9702418	1.646963	1	0.04335944200096	AB	0.9354096	0.4603641	1.060114	0.5067034	-0.2282041200124	AA	0.8902165	0.02981299	0.5980232	0.003990707	-0.3395625200199	BB	0.9598788	1	0.786671	1	0.1742665200240	AA	0.8782917	0.01066695	1.347941	0	0.01455177200251	AB	0.9409742	0.5209549	1.273798	0.4841168	-0.002807337200258	AB	0.7451698	0.4803278	1.725706	0.5366808	-0.1776247200260	AA	0.7948331	0.03137106	0.7327685	0	0.2470877200261	BB	0.8794336	0.9679449	1.162306	0.9942071	-0.04822653200262	AA	0.9256892	0.01441351	0.5731029	0.0006459319	-0.1737251200519	BB	0.8716854	0.992034	1.823947	1	0.2350173!sample_table_end
