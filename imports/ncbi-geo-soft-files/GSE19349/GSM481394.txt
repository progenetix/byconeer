After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from germ cell tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8887!Sample_contact_name = Yu Hsuan,,Wu!Sample_contact_email = allenwu03@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = National Yang-Ming University!Sample_contact_address = No.155, Sec.2, Linong Street!Sample_contact_city = Taipei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 112!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE19349!Sample_series_id = GSE19350!Sample_data_row_count = 620901#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200003	AA	0.9299463	0.02902752	0.9524908	0.002531043	-0.2341399200006	AB	0.787675	0.4320638	1.594239	0.470679	-0.4423666200047	AA	0.8612435	0.04069209	0.5691696	0	0.1196772200050	BB	0.8331156	0.9854783	0.8937701	0.9922256	-0.4530745200052	BB	0.9466458	0.987884	1.041127	0.999236	0.1644686200053	AA	0.7493879	0.06572838	1.004171	0	-0.1303174200070	NC	0.1123841	0.09105879	0.4654068	0.08962284	-0.07851105200078	BB	0.6531293	0.9610991	2.338847	1	0.3380784200087	AA	0.9078211	0.03251651	1.238719	0	0.2672073200091	BB	0.8204677	0.9641182	1.942671	0.9957558	0.2752041200096	AA	0.9354096	0.01466958	1.033404	0.003933279	-0.08284648200124	AA	0.8902165	0.02266165	0.6018821	0	-0.3245367200199	NC	0.08368229	0.9070527	0.5392388	0.9104923	-0.4239695200240	AB	0.8781173	0.5483671	1.316753	0.5857012	-0.1782113200251	AB	0.9339062	0.4001631	1.008736	0.3692044	-0.2616584200258	AA	0.7451698	0.04529272	1.640509	0	-0.02604466200260	AB	0.3943503	0.8650368	1.45806	0.7291673	0.2386036200261	AB	0.8794336	0.4542137	1.271161	0.4005833	-0.155089200262	AA	0.9256892	0.01614232	0.5320393	0.002591902	-0.2817789200519	BB	0.8716854	0.9913146	1.725242	1	0.1539257!sample_table_end
