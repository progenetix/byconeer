After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from germ cell tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium Human610_Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8887!Sample_contact_name = Yu Hsuan,,Wu!Sample_contact_email = allenwu03@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = National Yang-Ming University!Sample_contact_address = No.155, Sec.2, Linong Street!Sample_contact_city = Taipei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 112!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE19349!Sample_series_id = GSE19350!Sample_data_row_count = 620901#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200003	AB	0.9299463	0.4218115	1.026116	0.4825066	-0.3347687200006	AB	0.787675	0.4559572	2.092485	0.5000773	-0.06370309200047	AA	0.8612435	0.04563982	0.5680884	0	0.1193981200050	BB	0.8331156	0.9875903	1.008381	0.9941448	-0.2760005200052	BB	0.9466458	0.9912277	1.152439	1	0.3129185200053	AA	0.7493879	0.05874816	1.035363	0	-0.083208200070	AB	0.9705294	0.4357524	0.4495975	0.4370394	-0.2041268200078	BB	0.6531293	0.9545816	2.380033	1	0.3564826200087	AA	0.9078211	0.028932	1.181471	0	0.2016259200091	BB	0.8204677	0.9640013	1.829256	0.9956266	0.1882979200096	AA	0.9354096	0.01305487	0.8874434	0.002108444	-0.3017904200124	AA	0.8902165	0.02249012	0.6369119	0	-0.2427858200199	BB	0.9598788	1	0.5499736	1	-0.3421316200240	AB	0.8782917	0.3913317	1.415373	0.4251508	-0.1286558200251	AB	0.9409742	0.5276335	1.042311	0.4904703	-0.2963358200258	AA	0.7451698	0.05118889	1.761626	0.004110286	0.07252698200260	AB	0.7948331	0.7929692	1.360642	0.5836191	0.1685745200261	AB	0.8794336	0.5290936	1.250028	0.4768343	-0.222376200262	AA	0.9256892	0.01833467	0.4153098	0.005059628	-0.6401275200519	AA	0.8716854	0.006528306	1.92488	0	0.1967828!sample_table_end
