After hybridization, stringent washing was performed as described in PMID: 21423728.!Sample_scan_protocol = Slides were scanned in an Axon Scanner 4000A (Axon Instruments).!Sample_data_processing = Images were quantified using the GenePix Pro 6.0 package analysis software (Axon instruments) and uploaded at the BioArray Software Environment (BASE; http://www.base.thep.lu.se/) for filtering, normalization and statistical analysis, as described in. First, spots flagged by the GenePix software or disqualified after manual inspection were removed. Subsequently, probes with spot diameter <40 Âµm or intensity below background were removed. Background-corrected data was obtained by calculating the median foreground and subtracting the median background signal intensity for each channel. Intensity ratios for individual probes were calculated within arrays from background-corrected intensity levels of test sample divided by reference sample and data were normalized using the LOWESS algorith. The data was smoothed using a three-clone sliding window and CGH plotter was used to identify the extent of alterations using a segmentation constant of 7. Log2 ratios for two continuous BAC clones outside the threshold ranges were classified as copy number changes including gain (threshold +0.25), loss (-0.25), amplification (+1) and homozygous loss (-1).!Sample_platform_id = GPL9077!Sample_contact_name = Jamileh,,Hashemi!Sample_contact_email = Jamileh.Hashemi@ki.se!Sample_contact_laboratory = CMM, L8:01!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Medicine & Surgery!Sample_contact_institute = Karolinska Institutet!Sample_contact_address = Karolinska University Hospital !Sample_contact_city = Stockholm!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 171 76!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM929nnn/GSM929244/suppl/GSM929244_14.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE36511!Sample_data_row_count = 37698#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference DNA)#PRE_VALUE = Normalized ratio (tumor/reference DNA)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	-0.2731	0.8275148912	0.0164	1.0114146293	-0.1333	0.9117603234	-0.3271	0.7971518485	-0.3015	0.8113926236	-0.1321	0.9125094587	-0.4094	0.7529480278	0.1068	1.0768674699	-0.1093	0.92706201410	-0.2823	0.82225929911	-0.2645	0.8325024712	0.0310	1.02174542813	-0.4192	0.74784987814	0.0599	1.04237849215	-0.2834	0.82165239916	-0.0256	0.982387817	0.0027	1.00188759518	0.0363	1.02549321219	-0.2566	0.83708199320	-0.2659	0.831682473!sample_table_end
