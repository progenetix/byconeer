After hybridization, stringent washing was performed as described in PMID: 21423728.!Sample_scan_protocol = Slides were scanned in an Axon Scanner 4000A (Axon Instruments).!Sample_data_processing = Images were quantified using the GenePix Pro 6.0 package analysis software (Axon instruments) and uploaded at the BioArray Software Environment (BASE; http://www.base.thep.lu.se/) for filtering, normalization and statistical analysis, as described in. First, spots flagged by the GenePix software or disqualified after manual inspection were removed. Subsequently, probes with spot diameter <40 Âµm or intensity below background were removed. Background-corrected data was obtained by calculating the median foreground and subtracting the median background signal intensity for each channel. Intensity ratios for individual probes were calculated within arrays from background-corrected intensity levels of test sample divided by reference sample and data were normalized using the LOWESS algorith. The data was smoothed using a three-clone sliding window and CGH plotter was used to identify the extent of alterations using a segmentation constant of 7. Log2 ratios for two continuous BAC clones outside the threshold ranges were classified as copy number changes including gain (threshold +0.25), loss (-0.25), amplification (+1) and homozygous loss (-1).!Sample_platform_id = GPL9077!Sample_contact_name = Jamileh,,Hashemi!Sample_contact_email = Jamileh.Hashemi@ki.se!Sample_contact_laboratory = CMM, L8:01!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Medicine & Surgery!Sample_contact_institute = Karolinska Institutet!Sample_contact_address = Karolinska University Hospital !Sample_contact_city = Stockholm!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 171 76!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM929nnn/GSM929239/suppl/GSM929239_9.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE36511!Sample_data_row_count = 37698#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference DNA)#PRE_VALUE = Normalized ratio (tumor/reference DNA)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	0.2478	1.1873821162	0.1208	1.0873515283	0.1326	1.0962900974	0.1583	1.1160046945	-0.0306	0.9789871476	-0.0651	0.9558520657	-0.1426	0.9059067038	0.8781	1.8379576859	-0.0414	0.97169766210	0.2611	1.19837433711	-0.1130	0.92466431212	0.1079	1.07762912813	0.4751	1.3900046214	0.2438	1.1841332615	0.1847	1.13659660716	0.0960	1.06878473317	-0.2584	0.83601973918	-0.1766	0.88480340219	-0.0175	0.98796065220	0.2780	1.212547467!sample_table_end
