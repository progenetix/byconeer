After hybridization, stringent washing was performed as described in PMID: 21423728.!Sample_scan_protocol = Slides were scanned in an Axon Scanner 4000A (Axon Instruments).!Sample_data_processing = Images were quantified using the GenePix Pro 6.0 package analysis software (Axon instruments) and uploaded at the BioArray Software Environment (BASE; http://www.base.thep.lu.se/) for filtering, normalization and statistical analysis, as described in. First, spots flagged by the GenePix software or disqualified after manual inspection were removed. Subsequently, probes with spot diameter <40 Âµm or intensity below background were removed. Background-corrected data was obtained by calculating the median foreground and subtracting the median background signal intensity for each channel. Intensity ratios for individual probes were calculated within arrays from background-corrected intensity levels of test sample divided by reference sample and data were normalized using the LOWESS algorith. The data was smoothed using a three-clone sliding window and CGH plotter was used to identify the extent of alterations using a segmentation constant of 7. Log2 ratios for two continuous BAC clones outside the threshold ranges were classified as copy number changes including gain (threshold +0.25), loss (-0.25), amplification (+1) and homozygous loss (-1).!Sample_platform_id = GPL9077!Sample_contact_name = Jamileh,,Hashemi!Sample_contact_email = Jamileh.Hashemi@ki.se!Sample_contact_laboratory = CMM, L8:01!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Medicine & Surgery!Sample_contact_institute = Karolinska Institutet!Sample_contact_address = Karolinska University Hospital !Sample_contact_city = Stockholm!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 171 76!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM929nnn/GSM929250/suppl/GSM929250_20.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE36511!Sample_data_row_count = 37698#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference DNA)#PRE_VALUE = Normalized ratio (tumor/reference DNA)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	0.0400	1.028078552	0.2028	1.150942873	0.0404	1.0284341734	0.0640	1.0453850065	-0.0250	0.9828390556	0.1337	1.0970898357	-0.1191	0.9207690598	0.0575	1.0406301699	-0.8092	0.5706803510	-0.0453	0.96910921811	-0.0188	0.98702458412	0.0305	1.02134257313	0.0287	1.02008424814	0.1791	1.13215506415	-0.1653	0.89173117916	0.0934	1.06687443917	0.1624	1.11918436318	0.0791	1.05633579919	0.0936	1.06701362520	-0.0012	0.99920162!sample_table_end
