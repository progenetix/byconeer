After hybridization, stringent washing was performed as described in PMID: 21423728.!Sample_scan_protocol = Slides were scanned in an Axon Scanner 4000A (Axon Instruments).!Sample_data_processing = Images were quantified using the GenePix Pro 6.0 package analysis software (Axon instruments) and uploaded at the BioArray Software Environment (BASE; http://www.base.thep.lu.se/) for filtering, normalization and statistical analysis, as described in. First, spots flagged by the GenePix software or disqualified after manual inspection were removed. Subsequently, probes with spot diameter <40 Âµm or intensity below background were removed. Background-corrected data was obtained by calculating the median foreground and subtracting the median background signal intensity for each channel. Intensity ratios for individual probes were calculated within arrays from background-corrected intensity levels of test sample divided by reference sample and data were normalized using the LOWESS algorith. The data was smoothed using a three-clone sliding window and CGH plotter was used to identify the extent of alterations using a segmentation constant of 7. Log2 ratios for two continuous BAC clones outside the threshold ranges were classified as copy number changes including gain (threshold +0.25), loss (-0.25), amplification (+1) and homozygous loss (-1).!Sample_platform_id = GPL9077!Sample_contact_name = Jamileh,,Hashemi!Sample_contact_email = Jamileh.Hashemi@ki.se!Sample_contact_laboratory = CMM, L8:01!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Medicine & Surgery!Sample_contact_institute = Karolinska Institutet!Sample_contact_address = Karolinska University Hospital !Sample_contact_city = Stockholm!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 171 76!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM929nnn/GSM929241/suppl/GSM929241_11.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE36511!Sample_data_row_count = 37698#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference DNA)#PRE_VALUE = Normalized ratio (tumor/reference DNA)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	0.2442	1.184419132	-0.0410	0.9719608013	-0.0712	0.9518294934	0.1890	1.1399877185	-0.5593	0.6786243296	0.3159	1.2448184667	-0.2878	0.8191742098	-0.4021	0.7567779979	0.1656	1.12160742110	-0.2769	0.82533899711	-0.2786	0.82436972112	0.0097	1.00675980113	0.0813	1.05796107114	0.4105	1.32917948415	-0.0392	0.97321484316	-0.5970	0.66110902217	-0.1427	0.90582892718	0.2452	1.18528743819	0.1917	1.1421429820	-0.0653	0.955765345!sample_table_end
