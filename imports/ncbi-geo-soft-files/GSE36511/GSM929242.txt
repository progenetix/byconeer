After hybridization, stringent washing was performed as described in PMID: 21423728.!Sample_scan_protocol = Slides were scanned in an Axon Scanner 4000A (Axon Instruments).!Sample_data_processing = Images were quantified using the GenePix Pro 6.0 package analysis software (Axon instruments) and uploaded at the BioArray Software Environment (BASE; http://www.base.thep.lu.se/) for filtering, normalization and statistical analysis, as described in. First, spots flagged by the GenePix software or disqualified after manual inspection were removed. Subsequently, probes with spot diameter <40 Âµm or intensity below background were removed. Background-corrected data was obtained by calculating the median foreground and subtracting the median background signal intensity for each channel. Intensity ratios for individual probes were calculated within arrays from background-corrected intensity levels of test sample divided by reference sample and data were normalized using the LOWESS algorith. The data was smoothed using a three-clone sliding window and CGH plotter was used to identify the extent of alterations using a segmentation constant of 7. Log2 ratios for two continuous BAC clones outside the threshold ranges were classified as copy number changes including gain (threshold +0.25), loss (-0.25), amplification (+1) and homozygous loss (-1).!Sample_platform_id = GPL9077!Sample_contact_name = Jamileh,,Hashemi!Sample_contact_email = Jamileh.Hashemi@ki.se!Sample_contact_laboratory = CMM, L8:01!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Medicine & Surgery!Sample_contact_institute = Karolinska Institutet!Sample_contact_address = Karolinska University Hospital !Sample_contact_city = Stockholm!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 171 76!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM929nnn/GSM929242/suppl/GSM929242_12.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE36511!Sample_data_row_count = 37698#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference DNA)#PRE_VALUE = Normalized ratio (tumor/reference DNA)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	0.1175	1.0848201942	-0.2217	0.8575755963	-0.3590	0.7797128514	-0.4589	0.7275373425	-0.4322	0.7411061646	-0.4545	0.729750267	-0.4634	0.7252653378	-0.1076	0.9281092189	-0.5026	0.70581623210	-0.2363	0.84890674511	0.1070	1.07697315812	-0.2358	0.84924029613	0.1407	1.10244125514	-0.2379	0.84799985315	-0.0500	0.96595109916	-0.3533	0.78277405417	-0.1690	0.88947717418	0.2182	1.1633175119	0.0933	1.06680963320	-0.1567	0.897083253!sample_table_end
