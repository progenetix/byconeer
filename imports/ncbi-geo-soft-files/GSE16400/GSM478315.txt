Probes apparently not 60 bases in length were removed and arrays were normalized using the normexp deconvolution background correction method and loess regression of log-ratios to remove dye-bias.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Curtis!Sample_contact_email = christina.curtis@cancer.org.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01223404231!Sample_contact_fax = 1223 404208!Sample_contact_laboratory = TavarÃ©!Sample_contact_department = Computational Biology/Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Cambridge!Sample_contact_address = Robinson Way !Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB20RE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM478nnn/GSM478315/suppl/GSM478315_25072008_251469348866_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16400!Sample_data_row_count = 215002#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log-ratio ch2/ch1!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE8441	0.5825878825111	0.41692194361523	-0.39644091148654	0.51697981688814	-0.300690175233244	0.240608597201272	-0.060071128279	0.04739636277598	-0.056184389155641	-0.342463362192762	-0.03108995234368	-0.752647336237065	0.750383802232020	0.403407325145647	0.280128801209253	0.95663383839891	0.09347173761087	-0.06224427155441	0.31551201342553	-0.103452526!sample_table_end
