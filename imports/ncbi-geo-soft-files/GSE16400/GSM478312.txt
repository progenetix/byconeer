Probes apparently not 60 bases in length were removed and arrays were normalized using the normexp deconvolution background correction method and loess regression of log-ratios to remove dye-bias.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Curtis!Sample_contact_email = christina.curtis@cancer.org.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01223404231!Sample_contact_fax = 1223 404208!Sample_contact_laboratory = TavarÃ©!Sample_contact_department = Computational Biology/Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Cambridge!Sample_contact_address = Robinson Way !Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB20RE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM478nnn/GSM478312/suppl/GSM478312_25072008_251469348560_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16400!Sample_data_row_count = 215002#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log-ratio ch2/ch1!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE8441	-0.00316644925111	-0.23831702461523	-0.23900881748654	0.84369966688814	0.510020922233244	0.292409487201272	-0.714528978279	0.15671262677598	-0.778592399155641	-0.644914311192762	-0.08991669234368	-0.47905884237065	0.616075335232020	0.518208151145647	-0.313196596209253	0.5316155339891	-0.08219157161087	-0.134307126155441	0.15849999742553	-0.517913159!sample_table_end
