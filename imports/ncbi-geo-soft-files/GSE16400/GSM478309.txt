Probes apparently not 60 bases in length were removed and arrays were normalized using the normexp deconvolution background correction method and loess regression of log-ratios to remove dye-bias.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Curtis!Sample_contact_email = christina.curtis@cancer.org.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01223404231!Sample_contact_fax = 1223 404208!Sample_contact_laboratory = TavarÃ©!Sample_contact_department = Computational Biology/Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Cambridge!Sample_contact_address = Robinson Way !Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB20RE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM478nnn/GSM478309/suppl/GSM478309_25072008_251469348526_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16400!Sample_data_row_count = 215002#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log-ratio ch2/ch1!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE8441	0.09840639625111	0.25118341661523	0.03963456248654	0.75817226488814	0.090796035233244	-0.143892671201272	-0.533008428279	0.71522474677598	-0.508142485155641	-0.40496652192762	-0.09685204234368	-0.398170333237065	0.698018068232020	-0.127104436145647	-0.408295612209253	0.90474783439891	-0.06723152161087	0.588444938155441	0.15968056342553	0.18111261!sample_table_end
