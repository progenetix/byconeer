Probes apparently not 60 bases in length were removed and arrays were normalized using the normexp deconvolution background correction method and loess regression of log-ratios to remove dye-bias.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Curtis!Sample_contact_email = christina.curtis@cancer.org.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01223404231!Sample_contact_fax = 1223 404208!Sample_contact_laboratory = TavarÃ©!Sample_contact_department = Computational Biology/Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Cambridge!Sample_contact_address = Robinson Way !Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB20RE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM478nnn/GSM478303/suppl/GSM478303_US22502599_251469334141_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16400!Sample_data_row_count = 215002#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log-ratio ch2/ch1!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE8441	0.76260791325111	-0.83795986561523	-0.43073711948654	0.41680536188814	0.185032951233244	0.585924002201272	-0.1014164358279	-0.04916233577598	-0.089285648155641	-0.483345732192762	0.55083661434368	-3.419871926237065	-0.666866809232020	-0.692549778145647	-1.820774935209253	-0.3703000539891	-0.35874437561087	-0.545595163155441	-0.86655887342553	-0.49303795!sample_table_end
