Probes apparently not 60 bases in length were removed and arrays were normalized using the normexp deconvolution background correction method and loess regression of log-ratios to remove dye-bias.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Curtis!Sample_contact_email = christina.curtis@cancer.org.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01223404231!Sample_contact_fax = 1223 404208!Sample_contact_laboratory = TavarÃ©!Sample_contact_department = Computational Biology/Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Cambridge!Sample_contact_address = Robinson Way !Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB20RE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM478nnn/GSM478313/suppl/GSM478313_23072008_251469348554_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16400!Sample_data_row_count = 215002#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log-ratio ch2/ch1!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE8441	0.02881350325111	0.03052014861523	0.01495730348654	0.14345007488814	0.117427148233244	-0.013897446201272	0.0154925758279	0.06484384877598	-0.057519545155641	-0.178374863192762	-0.04993942634368	-0.004665543237065	0.478694429232020	0.227477415145647	-0.029873315209253	0.19695589339891	0.04170381961087	0.08807163155441	0.43796069242553	0.103797635!sample_table_end
