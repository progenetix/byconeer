Probes apparently not 60 bases in length were removed and arrays were normalized using the normexp deconvolution background correction method and loess regression of log-ratios to remove dye-bias.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Curtis!Sample_contact_email = christina.curtis@cancer.org.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01223404231!Sample_contact_fax = 1223 404208!Sample_contact_laboratory = TavarÃ©!Sample_contact_department = Computational Biology/Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Cambridge!Sample_contact_address = Robinson Way !Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB20RE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM478nnn/GSM478320/suppl/GSM478320_US22502599_251469334232_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16400!Sample_data_row_count = 215002#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log-ratio ch2/ch1!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE8441	-0.60273716425111	-0.34280846461523	0.10969571448654	0.16765027788814	-0.405529296233244	-0.61864334201272	-0.3378882968279	-0.60274351677598	-0.835212032155641	-1.084511872192762	-0.23831552334368	-0.374984714237065	0.419897967232020	-0.276482495145647	-0.305710721209253	-0.08180900539891	-0.75426496361087	0.082941507155441	0.12654444642553	-0.085401565!sample_table_end
