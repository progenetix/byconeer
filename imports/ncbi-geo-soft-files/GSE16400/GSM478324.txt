Probes apparently not 60 bases in length were removed and arrays were normalized using the normexp deconvolution background correction method and loess regression of log-ratios to remove dye-bias.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Curtis!Sample_contact_email = christina.curtis@cancer.org.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01223404231!Sample_contact_fax = 1223 404208!Sample_contact_laboratory = TavarÃ©!Sample_contact_department = Computational Biology/Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Cambridge!Sample_contact_address = Robinson Way !Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB20RE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM478nnn/GSM478324/suppl/GSM478324_US22502599_251469334236_S01_CGH-v4_91.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16400!Sample_data_row_count = 215002#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log-ratio ch2/ch1!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE8441	0.31386315525111	0.16758032661523	-0.19545094848654	0.24773434588814	-0.038614599233244	-0.625651689201272	-0.1674726148279	0.3360722377598	-0.684498641155641	-0.042747661192762	0.13740225134368	-0.002342581237065	0.67684467232020	0.462587382145647	-0.05143118209253	0.97817391339891	0.26298866661087	0.533011954155441	0.45728218442553	0.424909781!sample_table_end
