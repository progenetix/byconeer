Probes apparently not 60 bases in length were removed and arrays were normalized using the normexp deconvolution background correction method and loess regression of log-ratios to remove dye-bias.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Curtis!Sample_contact_email = christina.curtis@cancer.org.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01223404231!Sample_contact_fax = 1223 404208!Sample_contact_laboratory = TavarÃ©!Sample_contact_department = Computational Biology/Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Cambridge!Sample_contact_address = Robinson Way !Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB20RE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM478nnn/GSM478322/suppl/GSM478322_US22502599_251469338232_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16400!Sample_data_row_count = 215002#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log-ratio ch2/ch1!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE8441	0.66763425425111	0.28995149461523	-0.03110176448654	-0.28030026388814	-0.250931083233244	0.015361239201272	-0.2876992888279	-0.02396383677598	-0.423286939155641	-0.046059994192762	0.55547415134368	1.928784887237065	0.10510777232020	0.031858185145647	0.048117753209253	0.0227239239891	0.55191591361087	-0.054157306155441	1.10604455642553	-0.043370743!sample_table_end
