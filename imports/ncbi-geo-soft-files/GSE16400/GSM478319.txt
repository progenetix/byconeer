Probes apparently not 60 bases in length were removed and arrays were normalized using the normexp deconvolution background correction method and loess regression of log-ratios to remove dye-bias.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Curtis!Sample_contact_email = christina.curtis@cancer.org.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01223404231!Sample_contact_fax = 1223 404208!Sample_contact_laboratory = TavarÃ©!Sample_contact_department = Computational Biology/Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Cambridge!Sample_contact_address = Robinson Way !Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB20RE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM478nnn/GSM478319/suppl/GSM478319_25072008_251469348772_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16400!Sample_data_row_count = 215002#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log-ratio ch2/ch1!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE8441	0.12593480425111	-0.03708772261523	-0.12102005748654	0.05552477288814	0.031035344233244	-0.10833829201272	-0.0696307768279	0.0516890377598	-0.019836837155641	0.062324405192762	0.29645162234368	-0.021270668237065	0.477669292232020	0.278501191145647	-0.003879899209253	0.12782029239891	0.18132197661087	0.030624421155441	0.47199162842553	0.017653144!sample_table_end
