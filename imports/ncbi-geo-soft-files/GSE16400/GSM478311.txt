Probes apparently not 60 bases in length were removed and arrays were normalized using the normexp deconvolution background correction method and loess regression of log-ratios to remove dye-bias.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Curtis!Sample_contact_email = christina.curtis@cancer.org.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01223404231!Sample_contact_fax = 1223 404208!Sample_contact_laboratory = TavarÃ©!Sample_contact_department = Computational Biology/Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Cambridge!Sample_contact_address = Robinson Way !Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB20RE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM478nnn/GSM478311/suppl/GSM478311_US22502599_251469334155_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16400!Sample_data_row_count = 215002#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log-ratio ch2/ch1!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE8441	-0.14582820425111	0.04712381461523	0.01228633248654	-0.08489990588814	0.058398908233244	0.039154709201272	0.0291049268279	-0.11283219277598	0.123637204155641	-0.156945753192762	0.21942458934368	-0.384090604237065	-0.06664795232020	0.029550146145647	-0.20286161209253	0.0701881939891	0.23540959661087	0.22589686155441	0.05450931742553	0.023870148!sample_table_end
