Probes apparently not 60 bases in length were removed and arrays were normalized using the normexp deconvolution background correction method and loess regression of log-ratios to remove dye-bias.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Curtis!Sample_contact_email = christina.curtis@cancer.org.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01223404231!Sample_contact_fax = 1223 404208!Sample_contact_laboratory = TavarÃ©!Sample_contact_department = Computational Biology/Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Cambridge!Sample_contact_address = Robinson Way !Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB20RE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM478nnn/GSM478306/suppl/GSM478306_23072008_251469348646_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16400!Sample_data_row_count = 215002#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log-ratio ch2/ch1!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE8441	0.4963944825111	0.30123915161523	-0.46679955348654	0.1739788814	0.100641981233244	0.253322711201272	0.140655658279	0.3968310277598	-0.030039755155641	-0.193799599192762	0.02696076634368	-0.384034732237065	-0.489861456232020	-0.530134543145647	-0.066486172209253	-0.89547734739891	0.06263409561087	-0.01731817155441	-0.16047038942553	-0.065178115!sample_table_end
