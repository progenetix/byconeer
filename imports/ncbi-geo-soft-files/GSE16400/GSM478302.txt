Probes apparently not 60 bases in length were removed and arrays were normalized using the normexp deconvolution background correction method and loess regression of log-ratios to remove dye-bias.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Curtis!Sample_contact_email = christina.curtis@cancer.org.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01223404231!Sample_contact_fax = 1223 404208!Sample_contact_laboratory = TavarÃ©!Sample_contact_department = Computational Biology/Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Cambridge!Sample_contact_address = Robinson Way !Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB20RE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM478nnn/GSM478302/suppl/GSM478302_23072008_251469346101_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16400!Sample_data_row_count = 215002#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log-ratio ch2/ch1!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE8441	0.01693747625111	-0.2306767861523	-0.53936963848654	0.27867164788814	-0.201364227233244	-0.328565107201272	-0.1806097568279	0.14821464977598	-1.055799636155641	0.081955277192762	0.38247322134368	-0.5883949237065	0.904328207232020	0.583425529145647	-0.169432086209253	0.79883946739891	0.07066454261087	0.244096962155441	0.45901978842553	0.237115722!sample_table_end
