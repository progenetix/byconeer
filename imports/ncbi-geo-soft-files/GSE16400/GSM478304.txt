Probes apparently not 60 bases in length were removed and arrays were normalized using the normexp deconvolution background correction method and loess regression of log-ratios to remove dye-bias.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Curtis!Sample_contact_email = christina.curtis@cancer.org.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01223404231!Sample_contact_fax = 1223 404208!Sample_contact_laboratory = TavarÃ©!Sample_contact_department = Computational Biology/Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Cambridge!Sample_contact_address = Robinson Way !Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB20RE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM478nnn/GSM478304/suppl/GSM478304_US22502599_251469334162_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16400!Sample_data_row_count = 215002#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log-ratio ch2/ch1!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE8441	-0.09344580825111	-0.94988585861523	-0.09791614848654	0.10749900888814	-0.266699712233244	0.095233195201272	-0.6469368248279	-0.36906899477598	-0.35352433155641	-0.783727994192762	0.58068235634368	-1.151388187237065	-0.033544846232020	-0.244044276145647	-0.764840098209253	-0.29520558939891	-0.17571974361087	-0.429812651155441	0.0180479942553	-0.684607948!sample_table_end
