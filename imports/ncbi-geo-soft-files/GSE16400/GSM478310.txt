Probes apparently not 60 bases in length were removed and arrays were normalized using the normexp deconvolution background correction method and loess regression of log-ratios to remove dye-bias.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Curtis!Sample_contact_email = christina.curtis@cancer.org.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01223404231!Sample_contact_fax = 1223 404208!Sample_contact_laboratory = TavarÃ©!Sample_contact_department = Computational Biology/Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Cambridge!Sample_contact_address = Robinson Way !Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB20RE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM478nnn/GSM478310/suppl/GSM478310_25072008_251469348527_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16400!Sample_data_row_count = 215002#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log-ratio ch2/ch1!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE8441	0.49523263625111	-0.1119755361523	-0.85212090348654	0.25925825888814	-0.448492403233244	0.43269839201272	-0.2527870768279	0.45978913277598	-0.14474826155641	-0.468758801192762	0.08918218834368	-0.035820169237065	0.283957313232020	0.511981628145647	-0.047077237209253	0.03825076739891	0.08632825561087	0.134089484155441	0.21424639442553	-0.915974039!sample_table_end
