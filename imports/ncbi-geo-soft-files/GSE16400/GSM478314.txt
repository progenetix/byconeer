Probes apparently not 60 bases in length were removed and arrays were normalized using the normexp deconvolution background correction method and loess regression of log-ratios to remove dye-bias.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Curtis!Sample_contact_email = christina.curtis@cancer.org.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01223404231!Sample_contact_fax = 1223 404208!Sample_contact_laboratory = TavarÃ©!Sample_contact_department = Computational Biology/Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Cambridge!Sample_contact_address = Robinson Way !Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB20RE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM478nnn/GSM478314/suppl/GSM478314_25072008_251469348867_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16400!Sample_data_row_count = 215002#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log-ratio ch2/ch1!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE8441	0.760479625111	0.59138699361523	-0.41112272748654	0.38821685288814	-0.426484821233244	0.30649648201272	-0.0628017478279	0.09885842177598	-0.235594928155641	-0.342650666192762	0.24013490734368	-0.011578537237065	0.884314545232020	0.32197659145647	0.317002929209253	1.28141562839891	-0.03260274361087	0.143370897155441	0.22662768842553	0.182195786!sample_table_end
