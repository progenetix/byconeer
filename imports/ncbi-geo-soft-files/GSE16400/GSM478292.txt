Probes apparently not 60 bases in length were removed and arrays were normalized using the normexp deconvolution background correction method and loess regression of log-ratios to remove dye-bias.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Curtis!Sample_contact_email = christina.curtis@cancer.org.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01223404231!Sample_contact_fax = 1223 404208!Sample_contact_laboratory = TavarÃ©!Sample_contact_department = Computational Biology/Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Cambridge!Sample_contact_address = Robinson Way !Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB20RE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM478nnn/GSM478292/suppl/GSM478292_US22502599_251469334261_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16400!Sample_data_row_count = 215002#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log-ratio ch2/ch1!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE8441	-0.02430727625111	-0.40652320561523	-0.07021479548654	0.42487341188814	0.127467805233244	0.701497509201272	0.2347489348279	0.32487556877598	-0.131918315155641	0.021667077192762	1.08810696534368	-0.884625289237065	-0.466232615232020	0.137492119145647	-0.595291495209253	-0.11970717939891	0.22272868461087	-0.234467021155441	0.38637948642553	0.088364494!sample_table_end
