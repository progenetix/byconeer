Probes apparently not 60 bases in length were removed and arrays were normalized using the normexp deconvolution background correction method and loess regression of log-ratios to remove dye-bias.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Curtis!Sample_contact_email = christina.curtis@cancer.org.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01223404231!Sample_contact_fax = 1223 404208!Sample_contact_laboratory = TavarÃ©!Sample_contact_department = Computational Biology/Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Cambridge!Sample_contact_address = Robinson Way !Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB20RE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM478nnn/GSM478300/suppl/GSM478300_23072008_251469346099_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16400!Sample_data_row_count = 215002#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log-ratio ch2/ch1!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE8441	0.54463464825111	-0.17503084561523	-0.30596514848654	0.48536359988814	0.386509266233244	0.806020842201272	0.3170680458279	-0.02284189677598	0.081719217155641	0.292602664192762	0.66023580434368	1.499277492237065	-0.724783342232020	0.10321326145647	0.548158889209253	1.08551180239891	1.09085753361087	0.68293739155441	0.46923721942553	0.269616238!sample_table_end
