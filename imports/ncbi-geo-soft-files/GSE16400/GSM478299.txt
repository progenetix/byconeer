Probes apparently not 60 bases in length were removed and arrays were normalized using the normexp deconvolution background correction method and loess regression of log-ratios to remove dye-bias.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Curtis!Sample_contact_email = christina.curtis@cancer.org.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01223404231!Sample_contact_fax = 1223 404208!Sample_contact_laboratory = TavarÃ©!Sample_contact_department = Computational Biology/Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Cambridge!Sample_contact_address = Robinson Way !Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB20RE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM478nnn/GSM478299/suppl/GSM478299_23072008_251469346098_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16400!Sample_data_row_count = 215002#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log-ratio ch2/ch1!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE8441	0.57005985625111	-0.2795442761523	-0.31936834148654	0.46231478188814	0.14127311233244	1.026563354201272	0.8622467388279	1.61491168477598	0.394266532155641	0.1664447192762	0.75783107634368	1.754394605237065	0.24749003232020	0.007995935145647	0.920668428209253	0.51608797139891	0.93579161261087	0.944373829155441	0.34201224742553	0.332952854!sample_table_end
