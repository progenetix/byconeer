Probes apparently not 60 bases in length were removed and arrays were normalized using the normexp deconvolution background correction method and loess regression of log-ratios to remove dye-bias.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Curtis!Sample_contact_email = christina.curtis@cancer.org.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01223404231!Sample_contact_fax = 1223 404208!Sample_contact_laboratory = TavarÃ©!Sample_contact_department = Computational Biology/Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Cambridge!Sample_contact_address = Robinson Way !Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB20RE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM478nnn/GSM478305/suppl/GSM478305_23072008_251469348643_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16400!Sample_data_row_count = 215002#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log-ratio ch2/ch1!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE8441	-0.44765401625111	-0.45423550761523	-0.6230247348654	0.37474349388814	0.457463496233244	-0.041693875201272	-1.0060027838279	-0.07006814777598	-1.233745732155641	-0.684961063192762	-0.13469374934368	-1.037370998237065	0.500144343232020	0.308532375145647	-0.707889709209253	0.18857754539891	-0.36713864661087	0.09985396155441	0.32716511242553	-0.574752192!sample_table_end
