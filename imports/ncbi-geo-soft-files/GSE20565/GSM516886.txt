ITALICS 2.6.0 (available on http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.5/bioc/html/ITALICS.html) was used to generate the copy number data of 50K Xba chips and Partek Genomic Suite 6.10.0212 was used to generate copy number of SNP6 chips. CHP files were generated using apt-probeset-genotype command line tool from Affymetrix Power Tools package 1.12.0. BRLMM algorithm was used to generate genotype of 50K Xba chips, and Birdseed algorithm was used to generate genotype of SNP6 chips. Default settings were used for all the softwares and command line tools.!Sample_data_processing = Samples were normalized against Hapmap reference samples BUT NOT against paired normal samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Jean-Philippe,,MEYNIEL!Sample_contact_email = jean-philippe.meyniel@curie.fr!Sample_contact_phone = +33153194126!Sample_contact_fax = +33153194130!Sample_contact_department = Translational Research Dept!Sample_contact_institute = Institut Curie!Sample_contact_address = 26, rue d'Ulm!Sample_contact_city = PARIS!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75248!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM516nnn/GSM516886/suppl/GSM516886.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM516nnn/GSM516886/suppl/GSM516886.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20565!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall#Signal = Summarized signal (i.e., Copy Number)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SignalAFFX-1204904	BB	AFFX-121907	BB	AFFX-1258602	AA	AFFX-1304348	AA	AFFX-1329481	AB	AFFX-1375402	AB	AFFX-157566	BB	AFFX-1693093	AA	AFFX-1852733	BB	AFFX-1944727	AB	AFFX-1987483	AB	AFFX-2126602	AB	AFFX-2147527	AB	AFFX-2208108	AB	AFFX-2343975	AA	AFFX-2389926	BB	AFFX-2436931	BB	AFFX-2472766	AB	AFFX-2557092	AA	AFFX-2629782	AB	!sample_table_end
