ITALICS 2.6.0 (available on http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.5/bioc/html/ITALICS.html) was used to generate the copy number data of 50K Xba chips and Partek Genomic Suite 6.10.0212 was used to generate copy number of SNP6 chips. CHP files were generated using apt-probeset-genotype command line tool from Affymetrix Power Tools package 1.12.0. BRLMM algorithm was used to generate genotype of 50K Xba chips, and Birdseed algorithm was used to generate genotype of SNP6 chips. Default settings were used for all the softwares and command line tools.!Sample_data_processing = Samples were normalized against Hapmap reference samples BUT NOT against paired normal samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Jean-Philippe,,MEYNIEL!Sample_contact_email = jean-philippe.meyniel@curie.fr!Sample_contact_phone = +33153194126!Sample_contact_fax = +33153194130!Sample_contact_department = Translational Research Dept!Sample_contact_institute = Institut Curie!Sample_contact_address = 26, rue d'Ulm!Sample_contact_city = PARIS!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75248!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM518nnn/GSM518113/suppl/GSM518113.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM518nnn/GSM518113/suppl/GSM518113.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20565!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall#Signal = Summarized signal (i.e., Copy Number)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SignalAFFX-SNP_10000979	BB	4.59841AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1.56304AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1.97159AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	4.88194AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	1.92454AFFX-SNP_10029725	AA	3.81345AFFX-SNP_10034687	BB	1.91162AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	2.77817AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1.20866AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	2.27514AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	1.73742AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1.5261AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	1.14372AFFX-SNP_10046830	AA	1.28704AFFX-SNP_10047363	AA	2.61819AFFX-SNP_10047841	BB	1.338AFFX-SNP_10049334	AA	1.89323AFFX-SNP_10052664	AA	2.27407AFFX-SNP_10057887	AA	1.76806AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	1.97222!sample_table_end
