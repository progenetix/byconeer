ITALICS 2.6.0 (available on http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.5/bioc/html/ITALICS.html) was used to generate the copy number data of 50K Xba chips and Partek Genomic Suite 6.10.0212 was used to generate copy number of SNP6 chips. CHP files were generated using apt-probeset-genotype command line tool from Affymetrix Power Tools package 1.12.0. BRLMM algorithm was used to generate genotype of 50K Xba chips, and Birdseed algorithm was used to generate genotype of SNP6 chips. Default settings were used for all the softwares and command line tools.!Sample_data_processing = Samples were normalized against Hapmap reference samples BUT NOT against paired normal samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Jean-Philippe,,MEYNIEL!Sample_contact_email = jean-philippe.meyniel@curie.fr!Sample_contact_phone = +33153194126!Sample_contact_fax = +33153194130!Sample_contact_department = Translational Research Dept!Sample_contact_institute = Institut Curie!Sample_contact_address = 26, rue d'Ulm!Sample_contact_city = PARIS!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75248!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM518nnn/GSM518114/suppl/GSM518114.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM518nnn/GSM518114/suppl/GSM518114.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20565!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall#Signal = Summarized signal (i.e., Copy Number)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SignalAFFX-SNP_10000979	BB	1.66527AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1.52434AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1.5967AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	4.48624AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	1.5015AFFX-SNP_10029725	AA	2.58002AFFX-SNP_10034687	BB	1.99386AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	2.41753AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1.28321AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	2.32538AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	2.87744AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	2.54557AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	1.30669AFFX-SNP_10046830	AA	1.62398AFFX-SNP_10047363	AA	2.5392AFFX-SNP_10047841	BB	1.66761AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1.29824AFFX-SNP_10052664	AA	2.46514AFFX-SNP_10057887	AA	1.90632AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	2.3956!sample_table_end
