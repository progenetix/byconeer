The DNA was collected by centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4 Â°C. The pellet was dissolved in 130 Âµl hybridization solution and incubated at 73Â°C for 10 minutes to denature the DNA, followed by 60-120 minute incubation at 37Â°C. Next, the hybridization mixture was added to the array in a hybridization station (HybArray12TM, Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Zaventum, Belgium) and incubated for 38 hours at 37Â°C. After hybridization the slides were washed in six washing steps and dried by centrifugation for 3 minutes at 1000 g.!Sample_data_processing = The raw signal intensities were obtained with Bluefuse. The unreliable and morphologically corrupted measurement spots were removed from the data. We used the global mode normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8368!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE15470!Sample_data_row_count = 29999#ID_REF = #AMPCH1 = Total signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#AMPCH2 = Total signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#LOG2RATIO CH1/CH2 = Log, base 2, of the ratio of total signal in channel 1 divided by total signal in channel 2#CONFIDENCE = The Confidence Estimate in the calculated ratio, between 0 and 1, calculated by BlueFuse#QUALITY = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (1 acceptable; 0 not acceptable), estimated by BlueFuse#VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (CH1/CH2) but with flagged values removed#UNF_VALUE = normalized log2 ratios!sample_table_beginID_REF	AMPCH1	AMPCH2	LOG2RATIO CH1/CH2	CONFIDENCE	QUALITY	VALUE	UNF_VALUE1	581.374	554.108	0.069	0.96	1	0.079	0.0792	112.581	137.161	-0.285	0.81	0		3	129.354	99.527	0.378	0.6	0		4	2118.417	2052.382	0.046	0.99	1	0.056	0.0565	4080.697	3693.088	0.144	0.89	1	0.154	0.1546	1825.891	1529.147	0.256	0.98	1	0.266	0.2667	110.442	136.088	-0.301	0.79	1	-0.291	-0.2918	1276.893	1216.278	0.07	0.97	1	0.08	0.089	71.718	116.358	-0.698	0.57	1	-0.688	-0.68810	248.47	331.064	-0.414	0.93	1	-0.404	-0.40411	81.571	95.255	-0.224	0.45	1	-0.214	-0.21412	591.451	616.038	-0.059	0.97	1	-0.049	-0.04913	83.421	138.346	-0.73	0.68	1	-0.72	-0.7214	93.967	157.402	-0.744	0.7	1	-0.734	-0.73415	99.193	167.377	-0.755	0.75	1	-0.745	-0.74516	115.767	211.775	-0.871	0.75	1	-0.861	-0.86117	530.375	516.783	0.037	0.96	1	0.047	0.04718	841.12	642.459	0.389	0.97	1	0.399	0.39919	96.411	147.589	-0.614	0.61	1	-0.604	-0.60420	138.603	213.591	-0.624	0.78	1	-0.614	-0.614!sample_table_end
