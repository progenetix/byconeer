The DNA was collected by centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4 Â°C. The pellet was dissolved in 130 Âµl hybridization solution and incubated at 73Â°C for 10 minutes to denature the DNA, followed by 60-120 minute incubation at 37Â°C. Next, the hybridization mixture was added to the array in a hybridization station (HybArray12TM, Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Zaventum, Belgium) and incubated for 38 hours at 37Â°C. After hybridization the slides were washed in six washing steps and dried by centrifugation for 3 minutes at 1000 g.!Sample_data_processing = The raw signal intensities were obtained with Bluefuse. The unreliable and morphologically corrupted measurement spots were removed from the data. We used the global mode normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8368!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE15470!Sample_data_row_count = 29999#ID_REF = #AMPCH1 = Total signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#AMPCH2 = Total signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#LOG2RATIO CH1/CH2 = Log, base 2, of the ratio of total signal in channel 1 divided by total signal in channel 2#CONFIDENCE = The Confidence Estimate in the calculated ratio, between 0 and 1, calculated by BlueFuse#QUALITY = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (1 acceptable; 0 not acceptable), estimated by BlueFuse#VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (CH1/CH2) but with flagged values removed#UNF_VALUE = normalized log2 ratios!sample_table_beginID_REF	AMPCH1	AMPCH2	LOG2RATIO CH1/CH2	CONFIDENCE	QUALITY	VALUE	UNF_VALUE1	315.84	326.497	-0.048	0.97	0		2	84.524	85.839	-0.022	0.75	1	0.308	0.3083	81.155	81.65	-0.009	0.72	1	0.321	0.3214	952.235	698.478	0.447	0.99	1	0.777	0.7775	2019.891	1431.446	0.497	0.89	1	0.827	0.8276	785.565	559.418	0.49	0.98	0		7	65.974	64.379	0.035	0.57	0		8	502.318	445.903	0.172	0.95	1	0.502	0.5029	49.515	38.079	0.379	0.4	1	0.709	0.70910	162.538	157.108	0.049	0.91	1	0.379	0.37911	67.98	84.475	-0.313	0.64	1	0.017	0.01712	299.867	281.785	0.09	0.94	1	0.42	0.4213	73.644	82.822	-0.169	0.69	1	0.161	0.16114	63.876	89.615	-0.488	0.7	1	-0.158	-0.15815	98.246	117.518	-0.258	0.77	1	0.072	0.07216	73.821	83.634	-0.18	0.72	1	0.15	0.1517	243.196	195.309	0.316	0.94	1	0.646	0.64618	216.46	184.642	0.229	0.91	1	0.559	0.55919	75.772	97.388	-0.362	0.68	1	-0.032	-0.03220	84.102	95.081	-0.177	0.71	1	0.153	0.153!sample_table_end
