The DNA was collected by centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4 Â°C. The pellet was dissolved in 130 Âµl hybridization solution and incubated at 73Â°C for 10 minutes to denature the DNA, followed by 60-120 minute incubation at 37Â°C. Next, the hybridization mixture was added to the array in a hybridization station (HybArray12TM, Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Zaventum, Belgium) and incubated for 38 hours at 37Â°C. After hybridization the slides were washed in six washing steps and dried by centrifugation for 3 minutes at 1000 g.!Sample_data_processing = The raw signal intensities were obtained with Bluefuse. The unreliable and morphologically corrupted measurement spots were removed from the data. We used the global mode normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8368!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE15470!Sample_data_row_count = 29999#ID_REF = #AMPCH1 = Total signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#AMPCH2 = Total signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#LOG2RATIO CH1/CH2 = Log, base 2, of the ratio of total signal in channel 1 divided by total signal in channel 2#CONFIDENCE = The Confidence Estimate in the calculated ratio, between 0 and 1, calculated by BlueFuse#QUALITY = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (1 acceptable; 0 not acceptable), estimated by BlueFuse#VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (CH1/CH2) but with flagged values removed#UNF_VALUE = normalized log2 ratios!sample_table_beginID_REF	AMPCH1	AMPCH2	LOG2RATIO CH1/CH2	CONFIDENCE	QUALITY	VALUE	UNF_VALUE1	350.488	371.487	-0.084	0.96	1	-0.644	-0.6442	79.79	42.637	0.904	0.44	1	0.344	0.3443	87.796	71.766	0.291	0.56	1	-0.269	-0.2694	1239.109	1577.593	-0.348	0.98	1	-0.908	-0.9085	2152.351	2982.555	-0.471	0.88	1	-1.031	-1.0316	917.68	1219.398	-0.41	0.98	1	-0.97	-0.977	66.199	46.693	0.504	0.44	1	-0.056	-0.0568	658.692	800.611	-0.281	0.96	1	-0.841	-0.8419	53.909	44.37	0.281	0.32	1	-0.279	-0.27910	161.085	123.096	0.388	0.83	1	-0.172	-0.17211	57.709	33.049	0.804	0.36	1	0.244	0.24412	330.436	370.267	-0.164	0.97	1	-0.724	-0.72413	70.856	38.87	0.866	0.45	1	0.306	0.30614	82.392	70.121	0.233	0.61	1	-0.327	-0.32715	109.174	63.671	0.778	0.59	1	0.218	0.21816	81	63.133	0.36	0.55	1	-0.2	-0.217	350.774	361.628	-0.044	0.81	1	-0.604	-0.60418	447.969	407.726	0.136	0.93	1	-0.424	-0.42419	62.51	29.018	1.107	0.33	1	0.547	0.54720	116.731	53.625	1.122	0.51	1	0.562	0.562!sample_table_end
