The DNA was collected by centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4 Â°C. The pellet was dissolved in 130 Âµl hybridization solution and incubated at 73Â°C for 10 minutes to denature the DNA, followed by 60-120 minute incubation at 37Â°C. Next, the hybridization mixture was added to the array in a hybridization station (HybArray12TM, Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Zaventum, Belgium) and incubated for 38 hours at 37Â°C. After hybridization the slides were washed in six washing steps and dried by centrifugation for 3 minutes at 1000 g.!Sample_data_processing = The raw signal intensities were obtained with Bluefuse. The unreliable and morphologically corrupted measurement spots were removed from the data.
