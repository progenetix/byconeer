The DNA was collected by centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4 Â°C. The pellet was dissolved in 130 Âµl hybridization solution and incubated at 73Â°C for 10 minutes to denature the DNA, followed by 60-120 minute incubation at 37Â°C. Next, the hybridization mixture was added to the array in a hybridization station (HybArray12TM, Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Zaventum, Belgium) and incubated for 38 hours at 37Â°C. After hybridization the slides were washed in six washing steps and dried by centrifugation for 3 minutes at 1000 g.!Sample_data_processing = The raw signal intensities were obtained with Bluefuse. The unreliable and morphologically corrupted measurement spots were removed from the data. We used the global mode normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8368!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE15470!Sample_series_id = GSE23418!Sample_data_row_count = 29999#ID_REF = #AMPCH1 = Total signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#AMPCH2 = Total signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#LOG2RATIO CH2/CH1 = #CONFIDENCE = The Confidence Estimate in the calculated ratio, between 0 and 1, calculated by BlueFuse#QUALITY = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (1 acceptable; 0 not acceptable), estimated by BlueFuse#UNF_VALUE = normalized log2 ratios#VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (CH1/CH2) but with flagged values removed!sample_table_beginID_REF	AMPCH1	AMPCH2	LOG2RATIO CH2/CH1	CONFIDENCE	QUALITY	UNF_VALUE	VALUE1	968.565	1086.344	0.166	0.97	0		2	239.277	378.33	0.661	0.63	0		3	150.11	295.934	0.979	0.8	0		4	1761.081	1790.86	0.024	0.99	0		5	3295.394	3285.286	-0.004	0.87	0		6	1849.729	1776.101	-0.059	0.85	0		7	157.458	325.099	1.046	0.67	0		8	1433.387	1519.087	0.084	0.85	0		9	94.383	173.415	0.878	0.68	0		10	275.4	333.911	0.278	0.95	1	0.242	0.24211	112.688	200.098	0.828	0.8	1	-0.308	-0.30812	573.669	586.005	0.031	0.98	1	0.489	0.48913	156.163	199.194	0.351	0.84	1	0.169	0.16914	160.323	218.857	0.449	0.83	1	0.071	0.07115	236.188	367.992	0.64	0.96	1	-0.12	-0.1216	166.074	220.558	0.409	0.86	1	0.111	0.11117	412.175	443.205	0.105	0.86	1	0.415	0.41518	449.821	380.816	-0.24	0.95	1	0.76	0.7619	109.857	215.455	0.972	0.82	1	-0.452	-0.45220	197.342	265.158	0.426	0.91	1	0.094	0.094!sample_table_end
