The DNA was collected by centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4 Â°C. The pellet was dissolved in 130 Âµl hybridization solution and incubated at 73Â°C for 10 minutes to denature the DNA, followed by 60-120 minute incubation at 37Â°C. Next, the hybridization mixture was added to the array in a hybridization station (HybArray12TM, Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Zaventum, Belgium) and incubated for 38 hours at 37Â°C. After hybridization the slides were washed in six washing steps and dried by centrifugation for 3 minutes at 1000 g.!Sample_data_processing = The raw signal intensities were obtained with Bluefuse. The unreliable and morphologically corrupted measurement spots were removed from the data. We used the global mode normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8368!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE15470!Sample_data_row_count = 29999#ID_REF = #AMPCH1 = Total signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#AMPCH2 = Total signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#LOG2RATIO CH1/CH2 = Log, base 2, of the ratio of total signal in channel 1 divided by total signal in channel 2#CONFIDENCE = The Confidence Estimate in the calculated ratio, between 0 and 1, calculated by BlueFuse#QUALITY = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (1 acceptable; 0 not acceptable), estimated by BlueFuse#VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (CH1/CH2) but with flagged values removed#UNF_VALUE = normalized log2 ratios!sample_table_beginID_REF	AMPCH1	AMPCH2	LOG2RATIO CH1/CH2	CONFIDENCE	QUALITY	VALUE	UNF_VALUE1	88.686	124.366	-0.488	0.31	0		2	65.142	61.514	0.083	0.06	0		3	76.637	66.752	0.199	0.07	1		4	556.518	703.373	-0.338	0.99	1	-0.287	-0.2875	647.881	939.613	-0.536	0.69	1	-0.485	-0.4856	266.13	343.579	-0.369	0.95	1	-0.318	-0.3187	74.073	69.874	0.084	0.07	1		8	301.319	381.718	-0.341	0.96	1	-0.29	-0.299	65.289	57.824	0.175	0.05	1		10	143.594	145.311	-0.017	0.73	1	0.034	0.03411	83.227	85.121	-0.032	0.1	1		12	196.812	205.427	-0.062	0.86	1	-0.011	-0.01113	73.143	68.145	0.102	0.07	1		14	59.942	67.877	-0.179	0.06	1		15	101.035	107.807	-0.094	0.58	1	-0.043	-0.04316	89.057	95.409	-0.099	0.1	1		17	118.764	145.105	-0.289	0.66	1	-0.238	-0.23818	94.803	101.195	-0.094	0.1	1		19	68.948	76.72	-0.154	0.08	1		20	83.302	89.63	-0.106	0.09	1		!sample_table_end
