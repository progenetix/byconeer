Tissue: bone marrow. Cells: purified CD138+ plasma cells.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Mononuclear bone marrow cells were separated using gradient density centrifugation (lymphocyte separation medium, Eurobio, Les Ulis, France), and plasmacytosis was evaluated by morphology in these mononuclear cell suspensions.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Plasma cells (PCs) were then positively selected using anti-CD138âcoated microbeads (Miltenyi, Paris, France), because CD138 is expressed only on PCs (normal and malignant) within the bone marrow.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Purity and viability of the positively selected cell suspension was assessed by morphology and was above 90% in all the cases.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = DNA was extracted using the DNA AllPrep DNA/RNA MiniKit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = DNA quality and quantity were assessed using the Nanodrop Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc. Wilmington, DE).!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Biotinylated genomic DNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 90 ug PCR product (GeneChipÂ® Mapping 500K Assay Manual, 2005, Affymetrix).!Sample_hyb_protocol = Following fragmentation, 90 ug of genomic DNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 49C on either the GeneChipÂ® Mapping NspI or StyI chips. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = Newly diagnosed patients!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix GCOS, then dChip software (Cheng Li)!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Wilfried,,Gouraud!Sample_contact_department = Integrated Center of Oncology RenÃ© Gauducheau!Sample_contact_institute = ICO - UMGC!Sample_contact_address = bd Jacques Monod!Sample_contact_city = Saint Herblain!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 44805!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM323nnn/GSM323812/suppl/GSM323812.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12896!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = Affymetrix probe set ID#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-4296772	ABSNP_A-2133172	NoCallSNP_A-1857705	ABSNP_A-2037516	ABSNP_A-2066049	BBSNP_A-4292034	BBSNP_A-2046219	AASNP_A-2000349	AASNP_A-1899331	AASNP_A-1831168	ABSNP_A-4278614	AASNP_A-4269346	AASNP_A-1874310	ABSNP_A-4245737	BBSNP_A-4291787	AASNP_A-2003316	ABSNP_A-4251673	AASNP_A-4273236	BBSNP_A-2087801	AASNP_A-2134163	AA!sample_table_end
