DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = Image data were analysed with Genotyping Console 4.0 to obtain the CEL data files, which were also exported to the Nexus Biodiscovery Edition for data analysis and visualization. Quality controls assessed by Genotyping Console included Contrast Quality Control (CQC>0.4) produced by Birdseed and Median of the Absolute values of all Pairwise Differences (MAPD<0.35). Tumour and normal DNA samples were analysed individually with the Nexus Biodiscovery Edition using the SNP-FASST2 segmentation algorithm and using segment reporting tool filters: minimum of 100 Kb minimum genomic size of a segment, as well as by visual inspection.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = SÃ­lvia,,BeÃ !Sample_contact_email = sbea@clinic.cat!Sample_contact_phone = +34 93 2275536!Sample_contact_fax = +34 93 2275717!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Pathology!Sample_contact_department = HematoPathology!Sample_contact_institute = Hospital Clinic!Sample_contact_address = Rossello, 153!Sample_contact_city = Barcelona!Sample_contact_state = Barcelona!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 08036!Sample_contact_country = Spain!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1142nnn/GSM1142084/suppl/GSM1142084_M007_Colon.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1142nnn/GSM1142084/suppl/GSM1142084_M007_Colon.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE46969!Sample_data_row_count = 1813281
