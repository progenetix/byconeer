White blood cells were collected after red cell lysis using ACK reagent.  Plasma cells were selected using CD138 and the RoboSep (StemCell Technologies) as per the manufacturers protocol.  The purified plasma cells were lysed in 1 ml of TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies).!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = RNA was extracted from the TRIzol suspension using the manufacturers protocol and subsequently DNA was isolated from the remaining fraction as suggested by the manufacturer.  The isolated DNA was treated with RNaseA for 15 minutes and digested with proteinase K overnight.  Subsequently, the DNA was cleaned-up with two phenol-chloroform extractions and one final chlorophorm extraction before the DNA was precipitated with EtOH and NaOAc.  The purified DNA was quantified on a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 1.2 ug of DNA was digested with DNase I for 12 minutes.  The digested DNA was labeled using the BioPrime Array CGH Genomic Labeling Module with Amersham cUTP-CY dyes from GE Healthcare (Reference=CY3 and Tumor=CY5).  The labeled DNA was purified using Vivaspin 500 columns!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Promega XX Control DNA!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = sample_type: reference!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = No post collection treatment was performed.!Sample_growth_protocol_ch2 = After informed consent bone marrow aspirates were collected in sodium citrate tubes at MMRC member institutions and shipped by overnight courier to the MMRC Tissue Bank (Scottsdale, Arizona).
