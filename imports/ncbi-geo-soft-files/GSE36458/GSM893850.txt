In brief, 250 ng of genomic DNA was digested with the StyI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs), ligated to an adaptor with T4 ligase (New England Biolabs), and PCR-amplified using a 9700 Thermal Cycler I (Applied Biosystems) and Titanium Taq (Clontech) to achieve fragments ranging from 200-1100 bp. These fragments were pooled, concentrated, processed through a clean-up step, and further fragmented with DNaseI (Affymetrix) before being labeled, denatured, and hybridized to arrays!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were washed and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix)!Sample_description = Gastric-Tumor-SM-I8YB_CCGD-SNP_6.0!Sample_data_processing = Probe-level signal intensities were normalized to a common reference array using quantile normalization and combined to form SNP-level signal intensities using the dChip model-based expression (PM/MM) method . Genome-wide copy number estimates were obtained using five closest normal method, in which tumor signal intensities are divided by the geometric mean of the five normal samples closest to the tumor in Euclidean log2 ratio space (as described in Weir et al, Nature 2007).  Cancer samples were normalized against the plate normals included in this submission and also normals used in the TCGA ovarian cancer study (TCGA network, Nature, 2011). GEO Sample tables (VALUE) contain the resulting normalized copy-number values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Steven,E,Schumacher!Sample_contact_email = schum@broadinstitute.org!Sample_contact_phone = (617)501-3709!Sample_contact_laboratory = Beroukhim Lab!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Biology!Sample_contact_institute = Dana-Farber Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 450 Brookline Ave!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM893nnn/GSM893850/suppl/GSM893850_ROOKY_p_CCGD_July08_GenomeWideSNP_6_G07_319166.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE36458!Sample_series_id = GSE36460!Sample_data_row_count = 1851810#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized copy number data.
