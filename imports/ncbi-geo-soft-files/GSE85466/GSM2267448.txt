Reference models were created from SNP6.0 profiles of normal gastric tissues according to the hybridization batch. Copy number changes in cell lines and primary tumor samples were determined by using the reference model from primary normal samples. (2) Segmentation:  Copy number segmentation data was produced using the circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm implemented in the DNAcopy R package.!Sample_data_processing = copy number altered regions followed by the copy number alteration status!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Aditi,,Qamra!Sample_contact_email = qamraa99@gis.a-star.edu.sg!Sample_contact_institute = GIS!Sample_contact_address = 60 Biopolis Street, Genome, #02-01!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 138672!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2267nnn/GSM2267448/suppl/GSM2267448_AFCT1163-35.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2267nnn/GSM2267448/suppl/GSM2267448_P20020720_cna.bed.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE85466!Sample_series_id = GSE85467!Sample_data_row_count = 0
