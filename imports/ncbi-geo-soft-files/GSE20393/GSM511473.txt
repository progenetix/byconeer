Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511473/suppl/GSM511473.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.00617933273315A_16_P19392987	1.3577219247818A_16_P03557828	1.79730534553528A_16_P17733714	2.0082004070282A_16_P02790515	1.70472514629364A_16_P20786376	2.19346356391907A_16_P16999641	1.84403324127197A_16_P19986597	1.77183663845062A_16_P16448006	2.05664134025574A_16_P15473371	2.12623882293701A_16_P37089307	1.79686450958252A_16_P18472600	2.10624718666077A_16_P03088011	1.76255750656128A_16_P01731486	2.50113224983215A_16_P18379639	1.7484757900238A_16_P37656903	1.79249024391174A_16_P00109274	1.7561366558075A_16_P21144551	1.51942908763885A_16_P01809575	1.91521418094635A_14_P123460	1.93309485912323!sample_table_end
