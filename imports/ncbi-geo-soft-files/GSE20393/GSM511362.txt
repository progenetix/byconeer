Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511362/suppl/GSM511362.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.9745659828186A_16_P19392987	1.96611201763153A_16_P03557828	2.33800745010376A_16_P17733714	2.18809270858765A_16_P02790515	1.55590832233429A_16_P20786376	2.10861015319824A_16_P16999641	2.13744521141052A_16_P19986597	2.30974197387695A_16_P16448006	1.95986580848694A_16_P15473371	1.97700488567352A_16_P37089307	1.96716594696045A_16_P18472600	3.29269862174988A_16_P03088011	1.60068428516388A_16_P01731486	2.33618950843811A_16_P18379639	2.03846335411072A_16_P37656903	1.99509012699127A_16_P00109274	3.1208713054657A_16_P21144551	2.35610175132751A_16_P01809575	2.38648986816406A_14_P123460	1.61614239215851!sample_table_end
