Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511584/suppl/GSM511584.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.6766322851181A_16_P19392987	1.69395899772644A_16_P03557828	1.97162663936615A_16_P17733714	1.67800629138947A_16_P02790515	2.06580758094788A_16_P20786376	2.14351487159729A_16_P16999641	1.90066039562225A_16_P19986597	1.4131623506546A_16_P16448006	4.3001708984375A_16_P15473371	2.21903014183044A_16_P37089307	2.07468771934509A_16_P18472600	2.42805147171021A_16_P03088011	1.86014699935913A_16_P01731486	2.74621152877808A_16_P18379639	1.90598428249359A_16_P37656903	1.79906046390533A_16_P00109274	1.30694687366486A_16_P21144551	3.71026396751404A_16_P01809575	2.06954455375671A_14_P123460	1.54135859012604!sample_table_end
