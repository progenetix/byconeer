Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511471/suppl/GSM511471.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.04748892784119A_16_P19392987	1.98339319229126A_16_P03557828	1.41637444496155A_16_P17733714	2.50112915039062A_16_P02790515	1.75927400588989A_16_P20786376	2.12902045249939A_16_P16999641	1.98236930370331A_16_P19986597	1.78110754489899A_16_P16448006	1.92242443561554A_16_P15473371	2.4893786907196A_16_P37089307	1.81658148765564A_16_P18472600	3.08106017112732A_16_P03088011	1.44495666027069A_16_P01731486	2.7517728805542A_16_P18379639	2.72928786277771A_16_P37656903	2.25864815711975A_16_P00109274	1.43315029144287A_16_P21144551	2.06305885314941A_16_P01809575	2.40182542800903A_14_P123460	1.96015107631683!sample_table_end
