Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511522/suppl/GSM511522.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.5432254076004A_16_P19392987	2.16461253166199A_16_P03557828	2.03484344482422A_16_P17733714	1.80294716358185A_16_P02790515	1.54285442829132A_16_P20786376	1.97644901275635A_16_P16999641	1.82236647605896A_16_P19986597	1.56621551513672A_16_P16448006	2.13648104667664A_16_P15473371	3.021723985672A_16_P37089307	2.8293251991272A_16_P18472600	2.34931540489197A_16_P03088011	1.7337965965271A_16_P01731486	1.93101954460144A_16_P18379639	2.80570197105408A_16_P37656903	1.99912762641907A_16_P00109274	2.04554414749146A_16_P21144551	2.48346495628357A_16_P01809575	2.2224702835083A_14_P123460	1.56621551513672!sample_table_end
