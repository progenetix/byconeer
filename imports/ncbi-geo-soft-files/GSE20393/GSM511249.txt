Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511249/suppl/GSM511249.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.98970031738281A_16_P19392987	1.39320397377014A_16_P03557828	1.99028182029724A_16_P17733714	1.70268881320953A_16_P02790515	1.97345638275146A_16_P20786376	1.91810142993927A_16_P16999641	1.69361090660095A_16_P19986597	2.01075315475464A_16_P16448006	2.36307096481323A_16_P15473371	3.19562458992004A_16_P37089307	1.98815512657166A_16_P18472600	3.1870379447937A_16_P03088011	2.58183312416077A_16_P01731486	2.01335334777832A_16_P18379639	3.1870379447937A_16_P37656903	1.70153892040253A_16_P00109274	2.001140832901A_16_P21144551	2.01445245742798A_16_P01809575	2.01993846893311A_14_P123460	2.02827262878418!sample_table_end
