Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511296/suppl/GSM511296.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.29150521755219A_16_P19392987	1.79496288299561A_16_P03557828	2.29490542411804A_16_P17733714	1.88085222244263A_16_P02790515	1.27607023715973A_16_P20786376	2.25492715835571A_16_P16999641	1.3653769493103A_16_P19986597	2.31550645828247A_16_P16448006	2.29997658729553A_16_P15473371	3.22408509254456A_16_P37089307	2.28247451782227A_16_P18472600	6.6511902809143A_16_P03088011	1.83513689041138A_16_P01731486	1.7914844751358A_16_P18379639	3.27648019790649A_16_P37656903	1.87472808361053A_16_P00109274	2.4409601688385A_16_P21144551	2.31146240234375A_16_P01809575	1.75030887126923A_14_P123460	2.31550645828247!sample_table_end
