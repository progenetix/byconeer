Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511493/suppl/GSM511493.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.92664897441864A_16_P19392987	1.91119766235352A_16_P03557828	2.59159159660339A_16_P17733714	1.93064451217651A_16_P02790515	1.90962433815002A_16_P20786376	2.00441789627075A_16_P16999641	1.91952562332153A_16_P19986597	1.92042601108551A_16_P16448006	1.22721087932587A_16_P15473371	1.93460619449615A_16_P37089307	1.89324057102203A_16_P18472600	2.60315871238708A_16_P03088011	1.96496677398682A_16_P01731486	4.06367444992065A_16_P18379639	2.60315871238708A_16_P37656903	2.67315149307251A_16_P00109274	1.92535841464996A_16_P21144551	3.31443929672241A_16_P01809575	5.54316902160645A_14_P123460	1.92042601108551!sample_table_end
