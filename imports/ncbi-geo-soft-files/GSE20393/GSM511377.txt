Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511377/suppl/GSM511377.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.08984160423279A_16_P19392987	1.74421536922455A_16_P03557828	2.15308618545532A_16_P17733714	2.14885091781616A_16_P02790515	2.14934039115906A_16_P20786376	2.19681334495544A_16_P16999641	1.76344740390778A_16_P19986597	2.15422749519348A_16_P16448006	2.57503938674927A_16_P15473371	2.13298892974854A_16_P37089307	1.80212104320526A_16_P18472600	2.81511998176575A_16_P03088011	1.79324007034302A_16_P01731486	1.74887192249298A_16_P18379639	2.14116144180298A_16_P37656903	2.14885091781616A_16_P00109274	2.14641308784485A_16_P21144551	1.74943614006042A_16_P01809575	2.20002102851868A_14_P123460	1.75647854804993!sample_table_end
