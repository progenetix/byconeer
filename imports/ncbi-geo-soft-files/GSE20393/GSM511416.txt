Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511416/suppl/GSM511416.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.0369975566864A_16_P19392987	2.03711915016174A_16_P03557828	2.03571033477783A_16_P17733714	2.02231121063232A_16_P02790515	2.03816890716553A_16_P20786376	2.03685712814331A_16_P16999641	2.03204870223999A_16_P19986597	2.0306658744812A_16_P16448006	2.0329692363739A_16_P15473371	2.02675080299377A_16_P37089307	2.02954459190369A_16_P18472600	2.64049696922302A_16_P03088011	2.01967883110046A_16_P01731486	2.0219292640686A_16_P18379639	2.64049696922302A_16_P37656903	2.02231121063232A_16_P00109274	2.02316355705261A_16_P21144551	2.03725123405457A_16_P01809575	2.0219292640686A_14_P123460	2.0306658744812!sample_table_end
