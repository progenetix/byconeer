Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511598/suppl/GSM511598.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.05215311050415A_16_P19392987	1.77560544013977A_16_P03557828	1.28098213672638A_16_P17733714	1.57400417327881A_16_P02790515	1.48787522315979A_16_P20786376	2.16946506500244A_16_P16999641	1.7355318069458A_16_P19986597	1.83994555473328A_16_P16448006	3.11741709709167A_16_P15473371	2.54548239707947A_16_P37089307	3.78668189048767A_16_P18472600	2.41539597511292A_16_P03088011	2.05804419517517A_16_P01731486	2.58203840255737A_16_P18379639	2.3041844367981A_16_P37656903	2.06259822845459A_16_P00109274	2.54476118087769A_16_P21144551	2.31234383583069A_16_P01809575	2.52519106864929A_14_P123460	2.43509745597839!sample_table_end
