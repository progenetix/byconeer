Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511532/suppl/GSM511532.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.51882493495941A_16_P19392987	1.72330927848816A_16_P03557828	1.76141679286957A_16_P17733714	1.62102401256561A_16_P02790515	1.72855269908905A_16_P20786376	2.2951557636261A_16_P16999641	1.51619160175323A_16_P19986597	1.7378956079483A_16_P16448006	3.95567941665649A_16_P15473371	1.73481869697571A_16_P37089307	2.06313896179199A_16_P18472600	4.64791440963745A_16_P03088011	1.99187254905701A_16_P01731486	2.1540219783783A_16_P18379639	1.67675721645355A_16_P37656903	2.01875519752502A_16_P00109274	2.09355473518372A_16_P21144551	2.60789251327515A_16_P01809575	3.23048543930054A_14_P123460	1.7378956079483!sample_table_end
