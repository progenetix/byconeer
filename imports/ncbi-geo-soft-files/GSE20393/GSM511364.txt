Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511364/suppl/GSM511364.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.71862542629242A_16_P19392987	1.38192617893219A_16_P03557828	2.03746199607849A_16_P17733714	2.40727663040161A_16_P02790515	1.71622622013092A_16_P20786376	2.06650757789612A_16_P16999641	1.71654093265533A_16_P19986597	2.4141058921814A_16_P16448006	1.83938205242157A_16_P15473371	3.33070874214172A_16_P37089307	2.48973202705383A_16_P18472600	2.4388427734375A_16_P03088011	1.74253141880035A_16_P01731486	2.3433244228363A_16_P18379639	2.4388427734375A_16_P37656903	2.45350646972656A_16_P00109274	1.71059989929199A_16_P21144551	2.4260094165802A_16_P01809575	1.72601866722107A_14_P123460	2.4277138710022!sample_table_end
