Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511609/suppl/GSM511609.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.92130434513092A_16_P19392987	2.12211346626282A_16_P03557828	2.11629271507263A_16_P17733714	1.55520462989807A_16_P02790515	1.88246858119965A_16_P20786376	1.68933808803558A_16_P16999641	1.65465617179871A_16_P19986597	2.33478975296021A_16_P16448006	2.73845744132996A_16_P15473371	2.6351420879364A_16_P37089307	2.02421259880066A_16_P18472600	2.0818464756012A_16_P03088011	2.0557382106781A_16_P01731486	3.7419114112854A_16_P18379639	1.64209914207458A_16_P37656903	2.23526215553284A_16_P00109274	1.27680563926697A_16_P21144551	2.06761717796326A_16_P01809575	2.01550674438477A_14_P123460	2.32355093955994!sample_table_end
