Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511244/suppl/GSM511244.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.34471344947815A_16_P19392987	1.01828444004059A_16_P03557828	1.67690861225128A_16_P17733714	1.97716021537781A_16_P02790515	1.51827931404114A_16_P20786376	2.06963348388672A_16_P16999641	1.75840759277344A_16_P19986597	1.62553954124451A_16_P16448006	3.65036988258362A_16_P15473371	3.12552571296692A_16_P37089307	2.37975788116455A_16_P18472600	2.72650456428528A_16_P03088011	1.61262536048889A_16_P01731486	1.8399533033371A_16_P18379639	2.315762758255A_16_P37656903	0.919020175933838A_16_P00109274	1.63709115982056A_16_P21144551	3.2155921459198A_16_P01809575	1.3416109085083A_14_P123460	2.14121246337891!sample_table_end
