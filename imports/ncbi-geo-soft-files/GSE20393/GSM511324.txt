Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511324/suppl/GSM511324.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.09796166419983A_16_P19392987	1.77378821372986A_16_P03557828	1.4684796333313A_16_P17733714	1.77121782302856A_16_P02790515	2.10837173461914A_16_P20786376	2.07753682136536A_16_P16999641	1.76311755180359A_16_P19986597	2.10254383087158A_16_P16448006	1.79178690910339A_16_P15473371	2.44842743873596A_16_P37089307	1.76785802841187A_16_P18472600	3.13131070137024A_16_P03088011	1.78819000720978A_16_P01731486	2.09227228164673A_16_P18379639	3.13131070137024A_16_P37656903	2.06316041946411A_16_P00109274	1.77385365962982A_16_P21144551	1.50916433334351A_16_P01809575	2.09227228164673A_14_P123460	2.10254383087158!sample_table_end
