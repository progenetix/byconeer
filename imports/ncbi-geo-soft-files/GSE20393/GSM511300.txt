Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511300/suppl/GSM511300.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.41807985305786A_16_P19392987	1.53663539886475A_16_P03557828	2.00674080848694A_16_P17733714	2.99663400650024A_16_P02790515	2.47170519828796A_16_P20786376	2.99402761459351A_16_P16999641	1.94567918777466A_16_P19986597	1.56018888950348A_16_P16448006	2.55706906318665A_16_P15473371	3.34267425537109A_16_P37089307	2.79402017593384A_16_P18472600	2.44202995300293A_16_P03088011	2.87273406982422A_16_P01731486	1.96742081642151A_16_P18379639	2.44202995300293A_16_P37656903	2.90339946746826A_16_P00109274	1.56515276432037A_16_P21144551	2.41821098327637A_16_P01809575	1.97225332260132A_14_P123460	1.89313805103302!sample_table_end
