Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511246/suppl/GSM511246.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.97194111347198A_16_P19392987	2.22139120101929A_16_P03557828	2.01744556427002A_16_P17733714	2.15182042121887A_16_P02790515	1.29770982265472A_16_P20786376	2.16315698623657A_16_P16999641	1.4270840883255A_16_P19986597	1.75087916851044A_16_P16448006	2.17844748497009A_16_P15473371	2.70148587226868A_16_P37089307	1.71683716773987A_16_P18472600	2.63515186309814A_16_P03088011	1.78982412815094A_16_P01731486	2.37285327911377A_16_P18379639	2.40501284599304A_16_P37656903	2.12879610061646A_16_P00109274	1.63606333732605A_16_P21144551	2.27770972251892A_16_P01809575	2.19690442085266A_14_P123460	1.7640426158905!sample_table_end
