Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511531/suppl/GSM511531.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.34151387214661A_16_P19392987	2.08945059776306A_16_P03557828	1.51193654537201A_16_P17733714	1.75129950046539A_16_P02790515	1.90503680706024A_16_P20786376	2.01678943634033A_16_P16999641	1.49167227745056A_16_P19986597	1.99631059169769A_16_P16448006	1.95638537406921A_16_P15473371	2.01300835609436A_16_P37089307	2.53779578208923A_16_P18472600	2.84818530082703A_16_P03088011	1.99070727825165A_16_P01731486	1.58121919631958A_16_P18379639	2.41527342796326A_16_P37656903	1.79562187194824A_16_P00109274	1.51367628574371A_16_P21144551	2.46291637420654A_16_P01809575	2.5314929485321A_14_P123460	1.54026865959167!sample_table_end
