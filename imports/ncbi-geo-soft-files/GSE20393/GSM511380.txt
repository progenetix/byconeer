Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511380/suppl/GSM511380.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.86904323101044A_16_P19392987	1.85863292217255A_16_P03557828	1.45463919639587A_16_P17733714	1.44359827041626A_16_P02790515	1.43438589572906A_16_P20786376	1.4408894777298A_16_P16999641	1.44512546062469A_16_P19986597	1.86154305934906A_16_P16448006	1.8513331413269A_16_P15473371	2.42626762390137A_16_P37089307	1.42605769634247A_16_P18472600	5.91720962524414A_16_P03088011	2.27575421333313A_16_P01731486	1.85009169578552A_16_P18379639	4.99441623687744A_16_P37656903	2.32077145576477A_16_P00109274	2.62735271453857A_16_P21144551	2.25543332099915A_16_P01809575	1.84659123420715A_14_P123460	1.86552512645721!sample_table_end
