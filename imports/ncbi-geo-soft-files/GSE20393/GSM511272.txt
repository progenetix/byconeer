Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511272/suppl/GSM511272.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.78179681301117A_16_P19392987	2.12110686302185A_16_P03557828	1.84616851806641A_16_P17733714	2.1520631313324A_16_P02790515	2.21935629844666A_16_P20786376	2.34232378005981A_16_P16999641	1.29166042804718A_16_P19986597	2.2492368221283A_16_P16448006	2.3870575428009A_16_P15473371	2.27665948867798A_16_P37089307	3.00586676597595A_16_P18472600	4.07855367660522A_16_P03088011	2.04122757911682A_16_P01731486	1.77338898181915A_16_P18379639	3.03067398071289A_16_P37656903	2.0183961391449A_16_P00109274	2.23320317268372A_16_P21144551	2.74253964424133A_16_P01809575	1.87174081802368A_14_P123460	1.78388929367065!sample_table_end
