Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511288/suppl/GSM511288.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.95075249671936A_16_P19392987	2.09481287002563A_16_P03557828	1.74003660678864A_16_P17733714	1.86503088474274A_16_P02790515	1.6715270280838A_16_P20786376	1.92814815044403A_16_P16999641	1.93670117855072A_16_P19986597	1.70684838294983A_16_P16448006	1.95132923126221A_16_P15473371	2.04385137557983A_16_P37089307	2.03019905090332A_16_P18472600	2.3105936050415A_16_P03088011	1.88739788532257A_16_P01731486	2.24315905570984A_16_P18379639	1.97189676761627A_16_P37656903	1.77987825870514A_16_P00109274	1.817911028862A_16_P21144551	2.10472178459167A_16_P01809575	1.95103883743286A_14_P123460	1.81293570995331!sample_table_end
