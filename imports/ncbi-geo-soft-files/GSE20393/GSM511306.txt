Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511306/suppl/GSM511306.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.21162819862366A_16_P19392987	1.957883477211A_16_P03557828	2.74189043045044A_16_P17733714	3.24951457977295A_16_P02790515	1.56568586826324A_16_P20786376	1.59274888038635A_16_P16999641	1.07040417194366A_16_P19986597	1.8703488111496A_16_P16448006	2.45981478691101A_16_P15473371	3.48824691772461A_16_P37089307	2.66196608543396A_16_P18472600	2.26689505577087A_16_P03088011	2.10215497016907A_16_P01731486	1.9369455575943A_16_P18379639	2.04998135566711A_16_P37656903	1.96828961372375A_16_P00109274	1.65926742553711A_16_P21144551	1.85973477363586A_16_P01809575	2.16264462471008A_14_P123460	1.77793896198273!sample_table_end
