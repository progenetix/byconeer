Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511601/suppl/GSM511601.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.99806475639343A_16_P19392987	2.08297729492188A_16_P03557828	1.9418797492981A_16_P17733714	1.53083968162537A_16_P02790515	1.92960953712463A_16_P20786376	2.49982070922852A_16_P16999641	1.50776016712189A_16_P19986597	3.24100565910339A_16_P16448006	2.84123921394348A_16_P15473371	2.07489013671875A_16_P37089307	6.17216110229492A_16_P18472600	2.47890949249268A_16_P03088011	2.03758120536804A_16_P01731486	2.05087876319885A_16_P18379639	2.96542859077454A_16_P37656903	3.0894660949707A_16_P00109274	1.67584300041199A_16_P21144551	1.51986169815063A_16_P01809575	2.18164730072021A_14_P123460	2.59300565719604!sample_table_end
