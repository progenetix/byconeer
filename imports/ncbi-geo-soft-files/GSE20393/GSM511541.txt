Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511541/suppl/GSM511541.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.0550274848938A_16_P19392987	1.90905702114105A_16_P03557828	1.81292796134949A_16_P17733714	1.98111510276794A_16_P02790515	1.78633594512939A_16_P20786376	2.11656665802002A_16_P16999641	1.96350705623627A_16_P19986597	1.75569808483124A_16_P16448006	1.88842666149139A_16_P15473371	2.09605574607849A_16_P37089307	1.80242693424225A_16_P18472600	2.0236189365387A_16_P03088011	1.76542901992798A_16_P01731486	2.53665399551392A_16_P18379639	1.74974656105042A_16_P37656903	1.73870646953583A_16_P00109274	1.72728848457336A_16_P21144551	2.09297680854797A_16_P01809575	2.02526664733887A_14_P123460	1.91880035400391!sample_table_end
