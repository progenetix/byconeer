Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511477/suppl/GSM511477.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.72825872898102A_16_P19392987	1.34923160076141A_16_P03557828	1.5533686876297A_16_P17733714	1.69811534881592A_16_P02790515	1.72319424152374A_16_P20786376	2.38754272460938A_16_P16999641	1.9001886844635A_16_P19986597	1.74076890945435A_16_P16448006	1.89133906364441A_16_P15473371	2.28767442703247A_16_P37089307	1.7725168466568A_16_P18472600	2.50829601287842A_16_P03088011	1.80594444274902A_16_P01731486	2.56993889808655A_16_P18379639	2.31579613685608A_16_P37656903	1.77952027320862A_16_P00109274	1.83581399917603A_16_P21144551	2.53283858299255A_16_P01809575	2.10185742378235A_14_P123460	1.86568367481232!sample_table_end
