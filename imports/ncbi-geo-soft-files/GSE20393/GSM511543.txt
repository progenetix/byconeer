Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511543/suppl/GSM511543.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.15116560459137A_16_P19392987	2.15036749839783A_16_P03557828	2.10846161842346A_16_P17733714	1.15955483913422A_16_P02790515	2.11211824417114A_16_P20786376	1.15080678462982A_16_P16999641	1.13155770301819A_16_P19986597	2.13824033737183A_16_P16448006	2.14164352416992A_16_P15473371	2.14008831977844A_16_P37089307	2.10849189758301A_16_P18472600	4.05034446716309A_16_P03088011	2.12474060058594A_16_P01731486	2.13841533660889A_16_P18379639	4.05034446716309A_16_P37656903	2.11708807945251A_16_P00109274	2.14225721359253A_16_P21144551	2.14707136154175A_16_P01809575	2.13841533660889A_14_P123460	1.15670907497406!sample_table_end
