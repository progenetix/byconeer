Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511566/suppl/GSM511566.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.71001601219177A_16_P19392987	2.28904008865356A_16_P03557828	1.69725871086121A_16_P17733714	1.83401620388031A_16_P02790515	1.81367695331573A_16_P20786376	2.78742861747742A_16_P16999641	1.80268478393555A_16_P19986597	1.67274498939514A_16_P16448006	1.97982931137085A_16_P15473371	2.28045129776001A_16_P37089307	2.13766813278198A_16_P18472600	2.87539076805115A_16_P03088011	1.95233941078186A_16_P01731486	2.7101731300354A_16_P18379639	1.96879470348358A_16_P37656903	1.68784999847412A_16_P00109274	1.70909738540649A_16_P21144551	2.47076749801636A_16_P01809575	2.28581523895264A_14_P123460	1.80982255935669!sample_table_end
