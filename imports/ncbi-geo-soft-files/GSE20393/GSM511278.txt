Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511278/suppl/GSM511278.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.18130850791931A_16_P19392987	1.13025689125061A_16_P03557828	2.80851578712463A_16_P17733714	2.09932565689087A_16_P02790515	1.87748801708221A_16_P20786376	2.22508502006531A_16_P16999641	2.06208562850952A_16_P19986597	1.87696993350983A_16_P16448006	2.01245808601379A_16_P15473371	2.17001581192017A_16_P37089307	1.90822553634644A_16_P18472600	2.14822626113892A_16_P03088011	1.98219776153564A_16_P01731486	2.34843516349792A_16_P18379639	1.94502949714661A_16_P37656903	1.9351065158844A_16_P00109274	1.95088398456573A_16_P21144551	1.26568865776062A_16_P01809575	2.02315878868103A_14_P123460	1.15878081321716!sample_table_end
