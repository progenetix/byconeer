Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511277/suppl/GSM511277.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.96569526195526A_16_P19392987	1.96539127826691A_16_P03557828	1.95557570457458A_16_P17733714	1.39357054233551A_16_P02790515	1.95438325405121A_16_P20786376	1.96115624904633A_16_P16999641	1.95482110977173A_16_P19986597	1.9591805934906A_16_P16448006	2.52339649200439A_16_P15473371	1.96023344993591A_16_P37089307	1.95982944965363A_16_P18472600	1.95768165588379A_16_P03088011	2.72447729110718A_16_P01731486	1.97080910205841A_16_P18379639	1.95768165588379A_16_P37656903	1.95179557800293A_16_P00109274	1.9553188085556A_16_P21144551	1.97780692577362A_16_P01809575	2.51563477516174A_14_P123460	1.9591805934906!sample_table_end
