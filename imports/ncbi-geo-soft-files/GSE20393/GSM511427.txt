Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511427/suppl/GSM511427.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.0359890460968A_16_P19392987	2.0359890460968A_16_P03557828	2.06154632568359A_16_P17733714	2.03858733177185A_16_P02790515	2.04202818870544A_16_P20786376	2.04056596755981A_16_P16999641	2.03828310966492A_16_P19986597	1.94786751270294A_16_P16448006	2.03647136688232A_16_P15473371	2.03327679634094A_16_P37089307	2.03255367279053A_16_P18472600	2.06917357444763A_16_P03088011	2.03633499145508A_16_P01731486	2.05770587921143A_16_P18379639	2.17071676254272A_16_P37656903	2.03529143333435A_16_P00109274	2.0346097946167A_16_P21144551	2.02683901786804A_16_P01809575	2.05770587921143A_14_P123460	2.04344081878662!sample_table_end
