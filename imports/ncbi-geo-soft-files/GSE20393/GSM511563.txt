Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511563/suppl/GSM511563.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.08446741104126A_16_P19392987	2.08441996574402A_16_P03557828	2.1667754650116A_16_P17733714	1.35869884490967A_16_P02790515	1.98226392269135A_16_P20786376	1.37339854240417A_16_P16999641	1.35522317886353A_16_P19986597	2.09370851516724A_16_P16448006	2.10111379623413A_16_P15473371	2.10026001930237A_16_P37089307	2.0889687538147A_16_P18472600	2.95346355438232A_16_P03088011	2.09155011177063A_16_P01731486	2.0994439125061A_16_P18379639	2.11043262481689A_16_P37656903	2.1049644947052A_16_P00109274	2.11215472221375A_16_P21144551	2.09155488014221A_16_P01809575	2.7952892780304A_14_P123460	2.09370851516724!sample_table_end
