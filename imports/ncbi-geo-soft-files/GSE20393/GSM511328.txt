Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511328/suppl/GSM511328.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.96549534797668A_16_P19392987	1.97381949424744A_16_P03557828	2.06883907318115A_16_P17733714	1.39063370227814A_16_P02790515	1.9704681634903A_16_P20786376	1.97730934619904A_16_P16999641	1.97072374820709A_16_P19986597	2.07337307929993A_16_P16448006	2.06788110733032A_16_P15473371	2.15899300575256A_16_P37089307	2.0771598815918A_16_P18472600	1.97590088844299A_16_P03088011	1.96992373466492A_16_P01731486	2.07789540290833A_16_P18379639	1.97590088844299A_16_P37656903	1.3848420381546A_16_P00109274	2.07483673095703A_16_P21144551	1.97465813159943A_16_P01809575	2.07789540290833A_14_P123460	2.07337307929993!sample_table_end
