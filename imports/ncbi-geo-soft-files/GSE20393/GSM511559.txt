Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511559/suppl/GSM511559.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.59488606452942A_16_P19392987	1.97839915752411A_16_P03557828	2.06808185577393A_16_P17733714	1.94510006904602A_16_P02790515	1.84212446212769A_16_P20786376	1.90018665790558A_16_P16999641	1.93320512771606A_16_P19986597	1.68158316612244A_16_P16448006	2.62563490867615A_16_P15473371	2.21907687187195A_16_P37089307	1.8976731300354A_16_P18472600	2.27955555915833A_16_P03088011	1.8171980381012A_16_P01731486	2.33495020866394A_16_P18379639	2.27955555915833A_16_P37656903	1.91950011253357A_16_P00109274	1.57772493362427A_16_P21144551	2.34960675239563A_16_P01809575	2.72012734413147A_14_P123460	1.6463075876236!sample_table_end
