Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511555/suppl/GSM511555.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.23915457725525A_16_P19392987	2.23253679275513A_16_P03557828	1.2328964471817A_16_P17733714	1.26442885398865A_16_P02790515	2.13415837287903A_16_P20786376	1.26063668727875A_16_P16999641	1.24666309356689A_16_P19986597	2.1583468914032A_16_P16448006	2.19323968887329A_16_P15473371	2.60940909385681A_16_P37089307	2.16742968559265A_16_P18472600	3.20110297203064A_16_P03088011	1.77334344387054A_16_P01731486	2.24012923240662A_16_P18379639	3.12852597236633A_16_P37656903	3.10051107406616A_16_P00109274	2.20484018325806A_16_P21144551	2.27929472923279A_16_P01809575	3.10043239593506A_14_P123460	2.19831085205078!sample_table_end
