Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511268/suppl/GSM511268.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.96157789230347A_16_P19392987	1.31548392772675A_16_P03557828	1.97638595104218A_16_P17733714	1.70174276828766A_16_P02790515	1.74977385997772A_16_P20786376	1.86524128913879A_16_P16999641	2.07287168502808A_16_P19986597	1.80091822147369A_16_P16448006	1.9407172203064A_16_P15473371	2.19349718093872A_16_P37089307	1.95266485214233A_16_P18472600	3.30001831054688A_16_P03088011	1.63273131847382A_16_P01731486	2.33991050720215A_16_P18379639	3.02152252197266A_16_P37656903	1.57959175109863A_16_P00109274	1.74220025539398A_16_P21144551	2.26973533630371A_16_P01809575	2.24875783920288A_14_P123460	1.92781591415405!sample_table_end
