Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511276/suppl/GSM511276.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.97233879566193A_16_P19392987	1.39342749118805A_16_P03557828	1.99426698684692A_16_P17733714	1.32898259162903A_16_P02790515	2.06979990005493A_16_P20786376	1.50889050960541A_16_P16999641	1.97811925411224A_16_P19986597	2.10285925865173A_16_P16448006	2.12756443023682A_16_P15473371	2.20771455764771A_16_P37089307	1.77539157867432A_16_P18472600	3.77747464179993A_16_P03088011	1.85931885242462A_16_P01731486	2.3020646572113A_16_P18379639	3.77747464179993A_16_P37656903	1.31883752346039A_16_P00109274	1.74898087978363A_16_P21144551	3.40976357460022A_16_P01809575	2.32960438728333A_14_P123460	1.60891103744507!sample_table_end
