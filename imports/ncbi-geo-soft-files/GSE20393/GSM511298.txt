Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511298/suppl/GSM511298.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.1689133644104A_16_P19392987	1.49340653419495A_16_P03557828	0.745163202285767A_16_P17733714	1.48281848430634A_16_P02790515	1.54552447795868A_16_P20786376	1.48502421379089A_16_P16999641	1.44188416004181A_16_P19986597	1.98000979423523A_16_P16448006	2.19510054588318A_16_P15473371	2.60680150985718A_16_P37089307	2.06926465034485A_16_P18472600	2.26079750061035A_16_P03088011	1.75651288032532A_16_P01731486	2.17888283729553A_16_P18379639	2.26079750061035A_16_P37656903	1.8788206577301A_16_P00109274	1.85205864906311A_16_P21144551	2.22726225852966A_16_P01809575	1.50672137737274A_14_P123460	1.98000979423523!sample_table_end
