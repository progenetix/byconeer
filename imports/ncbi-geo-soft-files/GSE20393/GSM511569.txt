Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511569/suppl/GSM511569.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.69021368026733A_16_P19392987	1.63621413707733A_16_P03557828	1.87237954139709A_16_P17733714	2.27249979972839A_16_P02790515	1.61720848083496A_16_P20786376	2.57250571250916A_16_P16999641	2.1213481426239A_16_P19986597	1.66275882720947A_16_P16448006	2.58717465400696A_16_P15473371	2.26099562644958A_16_P37089307	3.07012271881104A_16_P18472600	2.31516456604004A_16_P03088011	2.04000473022461A_16_P01731486	1.98745441436768A_16_P18379639	2.06308364868164A_16_P37656903	2.0349223613739A_16_P00109274	1.90326845645905A_16_P21144551	2.94345617294312A_16_P01809575	1.56908857822418A_14_P123460	2.20643544197083!sample_table_end
