Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511283/suppl/GSM511283.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.86446845531464A_16_P19392987	1.89333927631378A_16_P03557828	1.9669224023819A_16_P17733714	2.50420236587524A_16_P02790515	1.83426034450531A_16_P20786376	2.07553553581238A_16_P16999641	1.52933537960052A_16_P19986597	1.93159079551697A_16_P16448006	2.50652456283569A_16_P15473371	2.48590064048767A_16_P37089307	1.53007507324219A_16_P18472600	2.80872440338135A_16_P03088011	2.3994288444519A_16_P01731486	1.66044354438782A_16_P18379639	3.59479713439941A_16_P37656903	1.83905649185181A_16_P00109274	1.84696424007416A_16_P21144551	2.27491164207458A_16_P01809575	1.91401076316833A_14_P123460	2.07027792930603!sample_table_end
