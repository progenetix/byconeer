Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511600/suppl/GSM511600.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.47576785087585A_16_P19392987	2.19734215736389A_16_P03557828	1.46505868434906A_16_P17733714	2.21988201141357A_16_P02790515	2.43517422676086A_16_P20786376	2.21154737472534A_16_P16999641	1.45554387569427A_16_P19986597	1.46831011772156A_16_P16448006	2.2239773273468A_16_P15473371	2.20542907714844A_16_P37089307	2.19021034240723A_16_P18472600	2.20665502548218A_16_P03088011	2.22281169891357A_16_P01731486	2.21350765228271A_16_P18379639	2.20665502548218A_16_P37656903	2.21340012550354A_16_P00109274	2.22701501846313A_16_P21144551	2.22275614738464A_16_P01809575	2.95019745826721A_14_P123460	1.47376430034637!sample_table_end
