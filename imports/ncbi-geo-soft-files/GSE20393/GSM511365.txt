Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511365/suppl/GSM511365.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.03215050697327A_16_P19392987	1.41224944591522A_16_P03557828	1.42030131816864A_16_P17733714	1.41835033893585A_16_P02790515	1.41184198856354A_16_P20786376	2.27454090118408A_16_P16999641	2.01109457015991A_16_P19986597	2.03723001480103A_16_P16448006	1.99754548072815A_16_P15473371	2.63739991188049A_16_P37089307	1.99721658229828A_16_P18472600	4.02799797058105A_16_P03088011	1.66290211677551A_16_P01731486	2.57142400741577A_16_P18379639	3.80563020706177A_16_P37656903	2.00469374656677A_16_P00109274	2.01250672340393A_16_P21144551	2.66134405136108A_16_P01809575	2.59572148323059A_14_P123460	1.42916095256805!sample_table_end
