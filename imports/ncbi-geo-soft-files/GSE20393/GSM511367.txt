Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511367/suppl/GSM511367.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.9665195941925A_16_P19392987	1.98909258842468A_16_P03557828	1.98345482349396A_16_P17733714	1.97272574901581A_16_P02790515	1.88358736038208A_16_P20786376	1.9750782251358A_16_P16999641	1.97470617294312A_16_P19986597	1.9680141210556A_16_P16448006	1.99373281002045A_16_P15473371	2.15257167816162A_16_P37089307	1.98050832748413A_16_P18472600	1.98469686508179A_16_P03088011	1.96563959121704A_16_P01731486	1.97297823429108A_16_P18379639	1.98666393756866A_16_P37656903	1.97272574901581A_16_P00109274	1.98003649711609A_16_P21144551	1.99168217182159A_16_P01809575	1.97903430461884A_14_P123460	1.98401725292206!sample_table_end
