Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511413/suppl/GSM511413.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.00198912620544A_16_P19392987	2.08233523368835A_16_P03557828	2.13783311843872A_16_P17733714	2.07264232635498A_16_P02790515	1.64798140525818A_16_P20786376	2.03223705291748A_16_P16999641	2.03277325630188A_16_P19986597	2.15732145309448A_16_P16448006	2.09909772872925A_16_P15473371	1.96062242984772A_16_P37089307	2.10637593269348A_16_P18472600	2.31125664710999A_16_P03088011	2.05891466140747A_16_P01731486	1.74790441989899A_16_P18379639	2.44054341316223A_16_P37656903	2.14330697059631A_16_P00109274	2.11977291107178A_16_P21144551	1.94140326976776A_16_P01809575	2.13078212738037A_14_P123460	2.04737448692322!sample_table_end
