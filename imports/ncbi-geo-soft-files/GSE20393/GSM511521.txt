Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511521/suppl/GSM511521.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.77885913848877A_16_P19392987	1.65384340286255A_16_P03557828	1.59903335571289A_16_P17733714	1.72321832180023A_16_P02790515	1.58536577224731A_16_P20786376	2.02276229858398A_16_P16999641	1.66184198856354A_16_P19986597	1.56220841407776A_16_P16448006	2.39515161514282A_16_P15473371	5.43695878982544A_16_P37089307	1.60014736652374A_16_P18472600	1.76907229423523A_16_P03088011	1.60638678073883A_16_P01731486	3.85609841346741A_16_P18379639	1.57762372493744A_16_P37656903	1.57066965103149A_16_P00109274	1.52804887294769A_16_P21144551	1.83890891075134A_16_P01809575	3.17054772377014A_14_P123460	0.939243257045746!sample_table_end
