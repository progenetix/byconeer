Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511355/suppl/GSM511355.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.6604745388031A_16_P19392987	2.64503836631775A_16_P03557828	1.75243270397186A_16_P17733714	1.35576021671295A_16_P02790515	2.5162947177887A_16_P20786376	1.79988992214203A_16_P16999641	2.18807554244995A_16_P19986597	1.78520119190216A_16_P16448006	2.22442960739136A_16_P15473371	1.79614233970642A_16_P37089307	2.21331191062927A_16_P18472600	1.8091242313385A_16_P03088011	1.39027559757233A_16_P01731486	2.20648431777954A_16_P18379639	1.78078103065491A_16_P37656903	1.35576021671295A_16_P00109274	1.78030526638031A_16_P21144551	1.86888265609741A_16_P01809575	2.25676536560059A_14_P123460	1.78520119190216!sample_table_end
