Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511511/suppl/GSM511511.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.98532378673553A_16_P19392987	2.29051113128662A_16_P03557828	1.68341958522797A_16_P17733714	2.10200524330139A_16_P02790515	1.6011016368866A_16_P20786376	1.90210771560669A_16_P16999641	1.60048973560333A_16_P19986597	2.30179524421692A_16_P16448006	2.3057324886322A_16_P15473371	1.99269473552704A_16_P37089307	1.56729459762573A_16_P18472600	2.24732327461243A_16_P03088011	2.57732796669006A_16_P01731486	2.0134961605072A_16_P18379639	2.23647904396057A_16_P37656903	2.09267258644104A_16_P00109274	1.65471398830414A_16_P21144551	2.26973247528076A_16_P01809575	2.03117489814758A_14_P123460	2.57124161720276!sample_table_end
