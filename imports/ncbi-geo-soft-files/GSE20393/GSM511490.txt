Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511490/suppl/GSM511490.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.99397349357605A_16_P19392987	1.98319411277771A_16_P03557828	1.99069881439209A_16_P17733714	1.78714752197266A_16_P02790515	1.99148547649384A_16_P20786376	1.95555865764618A_16_P16999641	1.9987860918045A_16_P19986597	1.98346054553986A_16_P16448006	1.99298322200775A_16_P15473371	1.99313676357269A_16_P37089307	1.99021935462952A_16_P18472600	1.99744355678558A_16_P03088011	1.99827468395233A_16_P01731486	2.22091126441956A_16_P18379639	1.99744355678558A_16_P37656903	1.78714752197266A_16_P00109274	1.98905682563782A_16_P21144551	2.1061315536499A_16_P01809575	2.23390793800354A_14_P123460	1.99890494346619!sample_table_end
