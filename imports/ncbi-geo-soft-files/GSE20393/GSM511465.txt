Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511465/suppl/GSM511465.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.93817675113678A_16_P19392987	1.22027313709259A_16_P03557828	1.61092245578766A_16_P17733714	1.87493169307709A_16_P02790515	1.69994330406189A_16_P20786376	2.19379186630249A_16_P16999641	1.76823425292969A_16_P19986597	1.61873948574066A_16_P16448006	1.76988220214844A_16_P15473371	2.61270260810852A_16_P37089307	1.69079923629761A_16_P18472600	1.91345381736755A_16_P03088011	2.18057465553284A_16_P01731486	3.62087154388428A_16_P18379639	1.68510448932648A_16_P37656903	1.64568185806274A_16_P00109274	1.58188855648041A_16_P21144551	3.31043648719788A_16_P01809575	2.85440325737A_14_P123460	1.76818084716797!sample_table_end
