Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511526/suppl/GSM511526.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.0334300994873A_16_P19392987	1.98148190975189A_16_P03557828	1.76446998119354A_16_P17733714	1.95445942878723A_16_P02790515	1.68548357486725A_16_P20786376	2.3101282119751A_16_P16999641	1.95701551437378A_16_P19986597	1.72483932971954A_16_P16448006	1.88916540145874A_16_P15473371	2.09648966789246A_16_P37089307	1.78862524032593A_16_P18472600	2.01107788085938A_16_P03088011	1.74580192565918A_16_P01731486	2.50474119186401A_16_P18379639	1.80411994457245A_16_P37656903	1.77968060970306A_16_P00109274	1.71071290969849A_16_P21144551	2.14874696731567A_16_P01809575	1.9675817489624A_14_P123460	1.89456570148468!sample_table_end
