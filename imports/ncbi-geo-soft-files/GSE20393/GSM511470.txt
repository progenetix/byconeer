Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511470/suppl/GSM511470.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.20995306968689A_16_P19392987	2.00360083580017A_16_P03557828	1.81520485877991A_16_P17733714	1.32362174987793A_16_P02790515	1.73646235466003A_16_P20786376	2.21240186691284A_16_P16999641	2.04627180099487A_16_P19986597	1.78942620754242A_16_P16448006	1.59900403022766A_16_P15473371	1.73359668254852A_16_P37089307	4.36807441711426A_16_P18472600	2.23619341850281A_16_P03088011	2.16932034492493A_16_P01731486	3.51384902000427A_16_P18379639	1.83277821540833A_16_P37656903	1.81918430328369A_16_P00109274	1.51497602462769A_16_P21144551	2.25675010681152A_16_P01809575	2.70465469360352A_14_P123460	2.04179358482361!sample_table_end
