Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511562/suppl/GSM511562.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.21222352981567A_16_P19392987	2.19759130477905A_16_P03557828	1.849285364151A_16_P17733714	2.23183417320251A_16_P02790515	2.16598534584045A_16_P20786376	1.83655834197998A_16_P16999641	1.35433328151703A_16_P19986597	1.68011844158173A_16_P16448006	2.32206726074219A_16_P15473371	3.27385878562927A_16_P37089307	2.09897232055664A_16_P18472600	2.93294548988342A_16_P03088011	3.15709447860718A_16_P01731486	2.28209567070007A_16_P18379639	2.07729434967041A_16_P37656903	2.19120287895203A_16_P00109274	2.33493852615356A_16_P21144551	2.45370292663574A_16_P01809575	2.30101227760315A_14_P123460	1.69199454784393!sample_table_end
