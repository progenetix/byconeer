Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511409/suppl/GSM511409.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.08839821815491A_16_P19392987	2.08334612846375A_16_P03557828	2.07252359390259A_16_P17733714	2.0803964138031A_16_P02790515	1.30246710777283A_16_P20786376	2.07271957397461A_16_P16999641	2.07462787628174A_16_P19986597	2.06501698493958A_16_P16448006	2.05678176879883A_16_P15473371	2.06731915473938A_16_P37089307	2.08426237106323A_16_P18472600	2.07228398323059A_16_P03088011	2.07180023193359A_16_P01731486	2.07369041442871A_16_P18379639	2.07228398323059A_16_P37656903	2.0652027130127A_16_P00109274	2.06913185119629A_16_P21144551	2.08332872390747A_16_P01809575	2.07369041442871A_14_P123460	2.06501698493958!sample_table_end
