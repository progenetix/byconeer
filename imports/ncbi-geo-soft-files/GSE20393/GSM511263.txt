Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511263/suppl/GSM511263.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.77277588844299A_16_P19392987	2.07007670402527A_16_P03557828	2.1986665725708A_16_P17733714	1.7459591627121A_16_P02790515	1.77713847160339A_16_P20786376	2.0200617313385A_16_P16999641	1.79539096355438A_16_P19986597	3.34736227989197A_16_P16448006	2.01445484161377A_16_P15473371	2.25447559356689A_16_P37089307	2.12163543701172A_16_P18472600	6.1463131904602A_16_P03088011	1.78303968906403A_16_P01731486	2.13400936126709A_16_P18379639	3.34295773506165A_16_P37656903	1.7459591627121A_16_P00109274	2.08691716194153A_16_P21144551	1.98280191421509A_16_P01809575	2.13400936126709A_14_P123460	1.79624199867249!sample_table_end
