Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511498/suppl/GSM511498.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.78481948375702A_16_P19392987	1.91531908512115A_16_P03557828	2.04971289634705A_16_P17733714	1.66031336784363A_16_P02790515	2.29689121246338A_16_P20786376	1.72220647335052A_16_P16999641	2.19228363037109A_16_P19986597	1.98964011669159A_16_P16448006	1.83885848522186A_16_P15473371	2.22993850708008A_16_P37089307	2.15186548233032A_16_P18472600	2.06552195549011A_16_P03088011	2.05004954338074A_16_P01731486	1.58663642406464A_16_P18379639	2.06552195549011A_16_P37656903	2.24430966377258A_16_P00109274	2.21683788299561A_16_P21144551	2.21902751922607A_16_P01809575	2.45957112312317A_14_P123460	1.7857962846756!sample_table_end
