Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511558/suppl/GSM511558.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.67462337017059A_16_P19392987	2.10942316055298A_16_P03557828	1.94045376777649A_16_P17733714	1.62499177455902A_16_P02790515	1.92373132705688A_16_P20786376	1.6160751581192A_16_P16999641	1.58676266670227A_16_P19986597	1.59770369529724A_16_P16448006	2.54814004898071A_16_P15473371	2.148277759552A_16_P37089307	2.03860902786255A_16_P18472600	3.80765175819397A_16_P03088011	1.73075211048126A_16_P01731486	2.16914057731628A_16_P18379639	2.34728097915649A_16_P37656903	2.29952597618103A_16_P00109274	2.48698449134827A_16_P21144551	2.64312648773193A_16_P01809575	2.124924659729A_14_P123460	1.65675127506256!sample_table_end
