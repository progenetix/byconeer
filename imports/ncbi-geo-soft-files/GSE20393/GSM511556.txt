Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511556/suppl/GSM511556.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.78880727291107A_16_P19392987	1.97186744213104A_16_P03557828	1.96386659145355A_16_P17733714	1.80717551708221A_16_P02790515	1.80565845966339A_16_P20786376	1.79925036430359A_16_P16999641	1.97391736507416A_16_P19986597	1.95675218105316A_16_P16448006	2.08010578155518A_16_P15473371	2.24351787567139A_16_P37089307	1.9648060798645A_16_P18472600	3.29158973693848A_16_P03088011	2.09814620018005A_16_P01731486	1.91976916790009A_16_P18379639	2.01712346076965A_16_P37656903	1.96182942390442A_16_P00109274	1.9713122844696A_16_P21144551	1.99299991130829A_16_P01809575	1.9933408498764A_14_P123460	1.95675218105316!sample_table_end
