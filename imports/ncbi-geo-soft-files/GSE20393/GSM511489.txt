Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511489/suppl/GSM511489.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.99931859970093A_16_P19392987	1.76508474349976A_16_P03557828	2.20410084724426A_16_P17733714	1.75800240039825A_16_P02790515	1.99215185642242A_16_P20786376	1.88696277141571A_16_P16999641	1.98175859451294A_16_P19986597	2.11412405967712A_16_P16448006	1.98731648921967A_16_P15473371	2.23175024986267A_16_P37089307	1.9828360080719A_16_P18472600	2.24404168128967A_16_P03088011	2.21538615226746A_16_P01731486	2.29172325134277A_16_P18379639	2.24404168128967A_16_P37656903	1.92974746227264A_16_P00109274	2.0115053653717A_16_P21144551	2.25850796699524A_16_P01809575	2.29172325134277A_14_P123460	2.11920046806335!sample_table_end
