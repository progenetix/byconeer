Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511577/suppl/GSM511577.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.90602564811707A_16_P19392987	1.92871809005737A_16_P03557828	1.74544501304626A_16_P17733714	1.79379200935364A_16_P02790515	1.52635991573334A_16_P20786376	2.67855191230774A_16_P16999641	1.75280284881592A_16_P19986597	1.96253836154938A_16_P16448006	2.32300543785095A_16_P15473371	1.95156705379486A_16_P37089307	2.26613879203796A_16_P18472600	2.6571524143219A_16_P03088011	1.7902752161026A_16_P01731486	3.44703912734985A_16_P18379639	2.28732013702393A_16_P37656903	1.62134909629822A_16_P00109274	1.52140557765961A_16_P21144551	1.9422619342804A_16_P01809575	2.76770234107971A_14_P123460	2.16742539405823!sample_table_end
