Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511404/suppl/GSM511404.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.05845808982849A_16_P19392987	2.04388308525085A_16_P03557828	2.0263876914978A_16_P17733714	2.04207634925842A_16_P02790515	2.01552295684814A_16_P20786376	2.04534339904785A_16_P16999641	1.45515990257263A_16_P19986597	2.03859806060791A_16_P16448006	2.03113508224487A_16_P15473371	2.04685735702515A_16_P37089307	2.03146815299988A_16_P18472600	2.03984832763672A_16_P03088011	2.06793189048767A_16_P01731486	1.39014661312103A_16_P18379639	2.03984832763672A_16_P37656903	2.03894352912903A_16_P00109274	2.03044819831848A_16_P21144551	2.09446978569031A_16_P01809575	2.07364678382874A_14_P123460	2.03859806060791!sample_table_end
