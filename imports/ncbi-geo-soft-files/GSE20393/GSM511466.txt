Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511466/suppl/GSM511466.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.14604926109314A_16_P19392987	2.06393384933472A_16_P03557828	1.08960568904877A_16_P17733714	1.78740477561951A_16_P02790515	1.81506931781769A_16_P20786376	2.33366775512695A_16_P16999641	1.5549703836441A_16_P19986597	1.84290063381195A_16_P16448006	2.02027368545532A_16_P15473371	2.19794273376465A_16_P37089307	1.85883808135986A_16_P18472600	2.16710186004639A_16_P03088011	2.63394021987915A_16_P01731486	2.54807066917419A_16_P18379639	1.96564376354218A_16_P37656903	1.58895516395569A_16_P00109274	1.13846909999847A_16_P21144551	2.28852295875549A_16_P01809575	2.04354786872864A_14_P123460	2.0275981426239!sample_table_end
