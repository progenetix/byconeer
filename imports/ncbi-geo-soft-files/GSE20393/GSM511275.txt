Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511275/suppl/GSM511275.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.27026510238647A_16_P19392987	1.43166565895081A_16_P03557828	0.72882878780365A_16_P17733714	1.82221531867981A_16_P02790515	1.36010551452637A_16_P20786376	2.03433156013489A_16_P16999641	2.13501167297363A_16_P19986597	2.27306032180786A_16_P16448006	1.79180634021759A_16_P15473371	2.48337817192078A_16_P37089307	2.2172257900238A_16_P18472600	2.52103233337402A_16_P03088011	1.91643512248993A_16_P01731486	2.60007619857788A_16_P18379639	1.68842744827271A_16_P37656903	1.97727298736572A_16_P00109274	1.41418504714966A_16_P21144551	2.308513879776A_16_P01809575	2.10261225700378A_14_P123460	2.36872625350952!sample_table_end
