Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511382/suppl/GSM511382.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.76213443279266A_16_P19392987	1.78572237491608A_16_P03557828	1.72391223907471A_16_P17733714	2.84342908859253A_16_P02790515	2.38915657997131A_16_P20786376	1.3803471326828A_16_P16999641	2.08161950111389A_16_P19986597	1.3870644569397A_16_P16448006	2.12752366065979A_16_P15473371	2.83756256103516A_16_P37089307	2.09587907791138A_16_P18472600	2.56033563613892A_16_P03088011	1.7955037355423A_16_P01731486	2.14220952987671A_16_P18379639	2.09951114654541A_16_P37656903	1.68193972110748A_16_P00109274	1.74307632446289A_16_P21144551	2.19413352012634A_16_P01809575	2.11180448532104A_14_P123460	1.3870644569397!sample_table_end
