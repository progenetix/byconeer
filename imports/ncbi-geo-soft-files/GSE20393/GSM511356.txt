Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511356/suppl/GSM511356.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.17394661903381A_16_P19392987	1.43419861793518A_16_P03557828	2.19113659858704A_16_P17733714	1.44563937187195A_16_P02790515	1.44296491146088A_16_P20786376	2.01192378997803A_16_P16999641	1.81690323352814A_16_P19986597	2.21691679954529A_16_P16448006	1.95284581184387A_16_P15473371	2.55799269676208A_16_P37089307	2.20440602302551A_16_P18472600	1.84087944030762A_16_P03088011	1.81461846828461A_16_P01731486	2.12852907180786A_16_P18379639	1.84087944030762A_16_P37656903	2.30909514427185A_16_P00109274	1.83220648765564A_16_P21144551	2.17640900611877A_16_P01809575	2.33500838279724A_14_P123460	2.21691679954529!sample_table_end
