Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511525/suppl/GSM511525.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.40834963321686A_16_P19392987	2.54455232620239A_16_P03557828	1.90809440612793A_16_P17733714	1.47354054450989A_16_P02790515	1.91172218322754A_16_P20786376	2.52172470092773A_16_P16999641	1.23637759685516A_16_P19986597	1.92905569076538A_16_P16448006	3.67667603492737A_16_P15473371	3.92428803443909A_16_P37089307	2.85923838615417A_16_P18472600	3.11632871627808A_16_P03088011	1.27131903171539A_16_P01731486	2.78903555870056A_16_P18379639	2.65198993682861A_16_P37656903	1.96064412593842A_16_P00109274	1.91556799411774A_16_P21144551	2.32025504112244A_16_P01809575	2.19487237930298A_14_P123460	1.29494476318359!sample_table_end
