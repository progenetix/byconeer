Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511374/suppl/GSM511374.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.98240852355957A_16_P19392987	1.9984039068222A_16_P03557828	1.97185778617859A_16_P17733714	1.52213978767395A_16_P02790515	1.97269940376282A_16_P20786376	1.98262298107147A_16_P16999641	1.99250972270966A_16_P19986597	2.56519508361816A_16_P16448006	1.98550295829773A_16_P15473371	1.98680329322815A_16_P37089307	1.97775149345398A_16_P18472600	2.88741946220398A_16_P03088011	1.99617505073547A_16_P01731486	1.99136090278625A_16_P18379639	2.42677140235901A_16_P37656903	1.98283338546753A_16_P00109274	1.92254781723022A_16_P21144551	2.00533246994019A_16_P01809575	1.97631967067719A_14_P123460	2.2049286365509!sample_table_end
