Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511586/suppl/GSM511586.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.02590656280518A_16_P19392987	2.51803731918335A_16_P03557828	2.0004186630249A_16_P17733714	1.5269740819931A_16_P02790515	1.96723282337189A_16_P20786376	1.52038502693176A_16_P16999641	2.51392245292664A_16_P19986597	1.53742611408234A_16_P16448006	2.03936052322388A_16_P15473371	2.29755115509033A_16_P37089307	2.0246901512146A_16_P18472600	2.45531988143921A_16_P03088011	2.0229160785675A_16_P01731486	2.01625299453735A_16_P18379639	2.45531988143921A_16_P37656903	1.5269740819931A_16_P00109274	2.02969479560852A_16_P21144551	2.0221803188324A_16_P01809575	2.02787327766418A_14_P123460	2.05461764335632!sample_table_end
