Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511494/suppl/GSM511494.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.92452752590179A_16_P19392987	1.16815650463104A_16_P03557828	1.92065525054932A_16_P17733714	1.17489528656006A_16_P02790515	1.86000001430511A_16_P20786376	1.91363477706909A_16_P16999641	2.92639255523682A_16_P19986597	1.91491746902466A_16_P16448006	1.91021251678467A_16_P15473371	1.92276775836945A_16_P37089307	1.90219211578369A_16_P18472600	2.69401574134827A_16_P03088011	1.93599510192871A_16_P01731486	1.93703305721283A_16_P18379639	3.49945974349976A_16_P37656903	1.17500138282776A_16_P00109274	1.92250728607178A_16_P21144551	1.93281257152557A_16_P01809575	1.93703305721283A_14_P123460	1.92224895954132!sample_table_end
