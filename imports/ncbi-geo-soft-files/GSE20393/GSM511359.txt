Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511359/suppl/GSM511359.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.00571846961975A_16_P19392987	1.99915063381195A_16_P03557828	2.00216889381409A_16_P17733714	1.50245082378387A_16_P02790515	1.99326860904694A_16_P20786376	1.99617040157318A_16_P16999641	2.00381684303284A_16_P19986597	1.68764388561249A_16_P16448006	2.00015163421631A_16_P15473371	1.99882030487061A_16_P37089307	1.99936521053314A_16_P18472600	1.99433982372284A_16_P03088011	2.00295925140381A_16_P01731486	2.00685572624207A_16_P18379639	1.99433982372284A_16_P37656903	1.50245082378387A_16_P00109274	1.98931705951691A_16_P21144551	2.00742101669312A_16_P01809575	1.99888932704926A_14_P123460	1.68751502037048!sample_table_end
