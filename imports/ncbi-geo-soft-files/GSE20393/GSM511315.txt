Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511315/suppl/GSM511315.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.01776266098022A_16_P19392987	1.76897180080414A_16_P03557828	1.98256635665894A_16_P17733714	2.13414311408997A_16_P02790515	1.85502934455872A_16_P20786376	1.76358222961426A_16_P16999641	1.72257781028748A_16_P19986597	2.11787986755371A_16_P16448006	2.10498380661011A_16_P15473371	1.92217004299164A_16_P37089307	2.09199976921082A_16_P18472600	2.40637350082397A_16_P03088011	2.01287770271301A_16_P01731486	2.02335071563721A_16_P18379639	1.9657289981842A_16_P37656903	1.97008180618286A_16_P00109274	2.13400077819824A_16_P21144551	1.96583867073059A_16_P01809575	1.95587277412415A_14_P123460	2.28099846839905!sample_table_end
