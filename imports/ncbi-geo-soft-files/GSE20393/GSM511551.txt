Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511551/suppl/GSM511551.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.3585798740387A_16_P19392987	1.9888653755188A_16_P03557828	1.57762575149536A_16_P17733714	2.10135650634766A_16_P02790515	2.7423791885376A_16_P20786376	1.6050181388855A_16_P16999641	1.52106034755707A_16_P19986597	2.03538751602173A_16_P16448006	2.07718133926392A_16_P15473371	2.11413860321045A_16_P37089307	2.19608926773071A_16_P18472600	2.83965182304382A_16_P03088011	2.29276728630066A_16_P01731486	1.68245148658752A_16_P18379639	1.29529309272766A_16_P37656903	2.07009601593018A_16_P00109274	2.08312940597534A_16_P21144551	2.27685117721558A_16_P01809575	2.1392080783844A_14_P123460	2.07988882064819!sample_table_end
