Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511592/suppl/GSM511592.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.9023050069809A_16_P19392987	2.24826169013977A_16_P03557828	1.54161906242371A_16_P17733714	2.11137652397156A_16_P02790515	1.60829865932465A_16_P20786376	2.18086218833923A_16_P16999641	1.54490303993225A_16_P19986597	2.15545272827148A_16_P16448006	2.26547241210938A_16_P15473371	1.90741729736328A_16_P37089307	2.91805338859558A_16_P18472600	2.20239949226379A_16_P03088011	2.56023573875427A_16_P01731486	2.24658703804016A_16_P18379639	2.15088391304016A_16_P37656903	2.11985158920288A_16_P00109274	2.13086843490601A_16_P21144551	2.51709198951721A_16_P01809575	2.27138066291809A_14_P123460	2.18989491462708!sample_table_end
