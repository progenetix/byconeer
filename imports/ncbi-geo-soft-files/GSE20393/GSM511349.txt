Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511349/suppl/GSM511349.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.64838588237762A_16_P19392987	1.92891430854797A_16_P03557828	1.96753144264221A_16_P17733714	2.2047655582428A_16_P02790515	1.70593976974487A_16_P20786376	2.22941899299622A_16_P16999641	1.98644328117371A_16_P19986597	1.97464966773987A_16_P16448006	1.68829190731049A_16_P15473371	2.5877320766449A_16_P37089307	2.21738958358765A_16_P18472600	2.35382127761841A_16_P03088011	1.66783511638641A_16_P01731486	2.21891522407532A_16_P18379639	2.22872638702393A_16_P37656903	2.22324347496033A_16_P00109274	1.97398924827576A_16_P21144551	1.73993706703186A_16_P01809575	2.21950459480286A_14_P123460	1.96806788444519!sample_table_end
