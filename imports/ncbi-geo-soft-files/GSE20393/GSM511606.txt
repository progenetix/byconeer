Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511606/suppl/GSM511606.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.36135387420654A_16_P19392987	2.51036143302917A_16_P03557828	1.36765563488007A_16_P17733714	1.8881049156189A_16_P02790515	2.1055748462677A_16_P20786376	1.34864091873169A_16_P16999641	2.26136517524719A_16_P19986597	2.24336385726929A_16_P16448006	4.15561008453369A_16_P15473371	2.77500462532043A_16_P37089307	2.60041403770447A_16_P18472600	2.2734682559967A_16_P03088011	2.3461902141571A_16_P01731486	2.32690811157227A_16_P18379639	2.2734682559967A_16_P37656903	1.89461398124695A_16_P00109274	1.35769891738892A_16_P21144551	2.21935248374939A_16_P01809575	2.32690811157227A_14_P123460	2.24336385726929!sample_table_end
