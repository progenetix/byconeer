Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511540/suppl/GSM511540.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.15165376663208A_16_P19392987	2.15436959266663A_16_P03557828	1.33922839164734A_16_P17733714	2.09813904762268A_16_P02790515	2.19532370567322A_16_P20786376	1.38189971446991A_16_P16999641	1.35101664066315A_16_P19986597	2.11461806297302A_16_P16448006	2.82007575035095A_16_P15473371	2.92941808700562A_16_P37089307	1.34418392181396A_16_P18472600	4.19063663482666A_16_P03088011	3.94712615013123A_16_P01731486	2.0653703212738A_16_P18379639	3.40829181671143A_16_P37656903	2.07756209373474A_16_P00109274	2.18633460998535A_16_P21144551	1.42847180366516A_16_P01809575	1.8411670923233A_14_P123460	2.11461806297302!sample_table_end
