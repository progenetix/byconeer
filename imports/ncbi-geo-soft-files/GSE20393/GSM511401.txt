Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511401/suppl/GSM511401.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.38456380367279A_16_P19392987	1.42294883728027A_16_P03557828	2.06600713729858A_16_P17733714	1.39578104019165A_16_P02790515	1.32505822181702A_16_P20786376	3.05163288116455A_16_P16999641	1.34520590305328A_16_P19986597	1.33831167221069A_16_P16448006	2.90404319763184A_16_P15473371	2.90852570533752A_16_P37089307	2.8562126159668A_16_P18472600	3.62517166137695A_16_P03088011	4.47768545150757A_16_P01731486	2.18092560768127A_16_P18379639	3.57953715324402A_16_P37656903	2.10265707969666A_16_P00109274	2.05584216117859A_16_P21144551	2.18740105628967A_16_P01809575	2.17189931869507A_14_P123460	2.178786277771!sample_table_end
