Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511588/suppl/GSM511588.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.04802274703979A_16_P19392987	1.42054831981659A_16_P03557828	1.67794334888458A_16_P17733714	1.74006545543671A_16_P02790515	1.71528744697571A_16_P20786376	1.73485338687897A_16_P16999641	1.73847270011902A_16_P19986597	1.78130769729614A_16_P16448006	4.16521215438843A_16_P15473371	2.71251797676086A_16_P37089307	1.99649584293365A_16_P18472600	2.03907108306885A_16_P03088011	1.77439701557159A_16_P01731486	2.00551533699036A_16_P18379639	1.9792867898941A_16_P37656903	1.72013461589813A_16_P00109274	1.75370454788208A_16_P21144551	2.94419503211975A_16_P01809575	1.7084892988205A_14_P123460	1.79047405719757!sample_table_end
