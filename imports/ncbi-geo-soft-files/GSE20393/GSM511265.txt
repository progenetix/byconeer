Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511265/suppl/GSM511265.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.58489298820496A_16_P19392987	1.92854452133179A_16_P03557828	2.2661726474762A_16_P17733714	1.57949316501617A_16_P02790515	1.89359557628632A_16_P20786376	2.66685128211975A_16_P16999641	1.92061221599579A_16_P19986597	2.26430630683899A_16_P16448006	1.91588222980499A_16_P15473371	2.91940641403198A_16_P37089307	2.27464389801025A_16_P18472600	2.6677622795105A_16_P03088011	1.92115426063538A_16_P01731486	2.00520730018616A_16_P18379639	2.6677622795105A_16_P37656903	1.56473672389984A_16_P00109274	1.90916633605957A_16_P21144551	2.57508897781372A_16_P01809575	1.95052361488342A_14_P123460	2.27707767486572!sample_table_end
