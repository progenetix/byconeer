Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511391/suppl/GSM511391.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.94866979122162A_16_P19392987	1.66573452949524A_16_P03557828	1.56668257713318A_16_P17733714	1.59597766399384A_16_P02790515	1.90465807914734A_16_P20786376	1.99689948558807A_16_P16999641	1.66330969333649A_16_P19986597	2.88037776947021A_16_P16448006	1.89182579517365A_16_P15473371	2.902747631073A_16_P37089307	2.86865234375A_16_P18472600	3.88591408729553A_16_P03088011	1.97806310653687A_16_P01731486	1.73567998409271A_16_P18379639	3.7385561466217A_16_P37656903	1.59597766399384A_16_P00109274	1.58613991737366A_16_P21144551	2.41868591308594A_16_P01809575	1.80737435817719A_14_P123460	1.59032809734344!sample_table_end
