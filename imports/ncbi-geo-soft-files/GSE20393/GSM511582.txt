Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511582/suppl/GSM511582.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.30068516731262A_16_P19392987	1.3292920589447A_16_P03557828	1.90263104438782A_16_P17733714	3.10668683052063A_16_P02790515	0.8573237657547A_16_P20786376	1.54323828220367A_16_P16999641	1.66575312614441A_16_P19986597	2.00141525268555A_16_P16448006	2.24760484695435A_16_P15473371	2.53676652908325A_16_P37089307	2.38433885574341A_16_P18472600	3.12650680541992A_16_P03088011	2.03793048858643A_16_P01731486	2.51983284950256A_16_P18379639	2.01926803588867A_16_P37656903	1.64421927928925A_16_P00109274	1.93685030937195A_16_P21144551	2.293044090271A_16_P01809575	1.90245378017426A_14_P123460	2.64947891235352!sample_table_end
