Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511332/suppl/GSM511332.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.48048257827759A_16_P19392987	2.01599192619324A_16_P03557828	2.01097083091736A_16_P17733714	2.00872254371643A_16_P02790515	1.46800768375397A_16_P20786376	1.47613382339478A_16_P16999641	2.00095844268799A_16_P19986597	2.01216912269592A_16_P16448006	2.01021647453308A_16_P15473371	4.14952278137207A_16_P37089307	2.01500344276428A_16_P18472600	3.61898159980774A_16_P03088011	1.4874255657196A_16_P01731486	2.01184368133545A_16_P18379639	3.61898159980774A_16_P37656903	2.00872254371643A_16_P00109274	1.46606683731079A_16_P21144551	2.02316951751709A_16_P01809575	2.03444266319275A_14_P123460	2.01216912269592!sample_table_end
