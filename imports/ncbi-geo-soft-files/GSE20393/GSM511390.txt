Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511390/suppl/GSM511390.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.35549163818359A_16_P19392987	1.96854865550995A_16_P03557828	2.79689311981201A_16_P17733714	1.90822970867157A_16_P02790515	2.80487132072449A_16_P20786376	2.36788868904114A_16_P16999641	2.43925929069519A_16_P19986597	2.35801410675049A_16_P16448006	1.44354164600372A_16_P15473371	1.89877474308014A_16_P37089307	1.86151933670044A_16_P18472600	2.16818571090698A_16_P03088011	1.9477367401123A_16_P01731486	1.91476047039032A_16_P18379639	2.16818571090698A_16_P37656903	1.90822970867157A_16_P00109274	1.89460062980652A_16_P21144551	3.87896370887756A_16_P01809575	1.76252722740173A_14_P123460	2.82034635543823!sample_table_end
