Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511273/suppl/GSM511273.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.50658524036407A_16_P19392987	3.02373576164246A_16_P03557828	1.91121029853821A_16_P17733714	2.30821084976196A_16_P02790515	1.50864112377167A_16_P20786376	2.2455632686615A_16_P16999641	2.14407968521118A_16_P19986597	1.52074480056763A_16_P16448006	2.35795593261719A_16_P15473371	2.15529847145081A_16_P37089307	3.03276181221008A_16_P18472600	4.30035066604614A_16_P03088011	1.86516118049622A_16_P01731486	2.38078498840332A_16_P18379639	3.08280801773071A_16_P37656903	1.93388664722443A_16_P00109274	2.01512002944946A_16_P21144551	1.587726354599A_16_P01809575	3.11023497581482A_14_P123460	1.55043339729309!sample_table_end
