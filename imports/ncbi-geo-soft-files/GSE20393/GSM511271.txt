Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511271/suppl/GSM511271.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.02316761016846A_16_P19392987	1.94368481636047A_16_P03557828	1.62651228904724A_16_P17733714	2.0940842628479A_16_P02790515	1.80920207500458A_16_P20786376	2.06648683547974A_16_P16999641	1.94632601737976A_16_P19986597	1.73966121673584A_16_P16448006	1.99624168872833A_16_P15473371	2.07386374473572A_16_P37089307	1.71156144142151A_16_P18472600	2.36502432823181A_16_P03088011	1.69526445865631A_16_P01731486	2.36411666870117A_16_P18379639	2.36997556686401A_16_P37656903	1.9012862443924A_16_P00109274	1.73331069946289A_16_P21144551	2.23621654510498A_16_P01809575	1.95047736167908A_14_P123460	1.8960382938385!sample_table_end
