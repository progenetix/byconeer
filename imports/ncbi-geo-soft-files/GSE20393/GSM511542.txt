Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511542/suppl/GSM511542.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.92777347564697A_16_P19392987	1.85470104217529A_16_P03557828	1.64601278305054A_16_P17733714	1.76606774330139A_16_P02790515	1.68434166908264A_16_P20786376	2.19848799705505A_16_P16999641	1.83993363380432A_16_P19986597	2.57868099212646A_16_P16448006	1.98454678058624A_16_P15473371	2.69695782661438A_16_P37089307	1.71156060695648A_16_P18472600	2.00183486938477A_16_P03088011	1.64478003978729A_16_P01731486	3.18321990966797A_16_P18379639	1.65412700176239A_16_P37656903	1.64717507362366A_16_P00109274	1.72642350196838A_16_P21144551	2.25788354873657A_16_P01809575	2.55348110198975A_14_P123460	2.87107515335083!sample_table_end
