Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511257/suppl/GSM511257.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.65399467945099A_16_P19392987	1.60144066810608A_16_P03557828	1.68827044963837A_16_P17733714	2.21793675422668A_16_P02790515	1.36993312835693A_16_P20786376	1.67546892166138A_16_P16999641	2.20414423942566A_16_P19986597	1.65835011005402A_16_P16448006	2.12169027328491A_16_P15473371	2.08931088447571A_16_P37089307	1.79442703723907A_16_P18472600	2.7343909740448A_16_P03088011	1.34393620491028A_16_P01731486	2.39534687995911A_16_P18379639	1.97338974475861A_16_P37656903	1.64716100692749A_16_P00109274	1.29795753955841A_16_P21144551	2.48084449768066A_16_P01809575	1.8306291103363A_14_P123460	1.78733313083649!sample_table_end
