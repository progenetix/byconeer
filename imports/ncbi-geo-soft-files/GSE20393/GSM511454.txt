Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511454/suppl/GSM511454.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.04538202285767A_16_P19392987	1.49892354011536A_16_P03557828	1.9964644908905A_16_P17733714	1.45268273353577A_16_P02790515	1.41913366317749A_16_P20786376	2.04849433898926A_16_P16999641	2.01433897018433A_16_P19986597	2.01729941368103A_16_P16448006	1.67928600311279A_16_P15473371	2.06449913978577A_16_P37089307	2.02407169342041A_16_P18472600	2.05528521537781A_16_P03088011	2.06823515892029A_16_P01731486	2.04392576217651A_16_P18379639	2.04437804222107A_16_P37656903	2.01192808151245A_16_P00109274	2.06449913978577A_16_P21144551	2.12337732315063A_16_P01809575	2.04842376708984A_14_P123460	2.01729941368103!sample_table_end
