Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511554/suppl/GSM511554.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.10808706283569A_16_P19392987	2.11496019363403A_16_P03557828	1.50071263313293A_16_P17733714	1.53478193283081A_16_P02790515	2.16795873641968A_16_P20786376	2.21678709983826A_16_P16999641	1.80647122859955A_16_P19986597	1.525914311409A_16_P16448006	2.20194888114929A_16_P15473371	2.2075047492981A_16_P37089307	2.85423374176025A_16_P18472600	2.87433838844299A_16_P03088011	4.19916343688965A_16_P01731486	1.69172310829163A_16_P18379639	2.12784504890442A_16_P37656903	2.17346715927124A_16_P00109274	2.19436931610107A_16_P21144551	2.28231859207153A_16_P01809575	1.56141805648804A_14_P123460	2.2094943523407!sample_table_end
