Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511513/suppl/GSM511513.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.57992208003998A_16_P19392987	1.58448541164398A_16_P03557828	2.01560854911804A_16_P17733714	2.38277387619019A_16_P02790515	1.5552613735199A_16_P20786376	1.57006251811981A_16_P16999641	1.56452596187592A_16_P19986597	2.02981972694397A_16_P16448006	3.15298295021057A_16_P15473371	1.57951736450195A_16_P37089307	2.35384368896484A_16_P18472600	3.26253199577332A_16_P03088011	1.58574652671814A_16_P01731486	1.58938539028168A_16_P18379639	3.25898408889771A_16_P37656903	2.37610077857971A_16_P00109274	2.37638306617737A_16_P21144551	3.16072177886963A_16_P01809575	1.58908545970917A_14_P123460	1.59029805660248!sample_table_end
