Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511372/suppl/GSM511372.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.61743438243866A_16_P19392987	1.86909699440002A_16_P03557828	1.90878522396088A_16_P17733714	2.5285656452179A_16_P02790515	2.02967810630798A_16_P20786376	2.05688953399658A_16_P16999641	1.83507585525513A_16_P19986597	2.14570736885071A_16_P16448006	1.90269267559052A_16_P15473371	2.23870491981506A_16_P37089307	2.09324669837952A_16_P18472600	2.62261295318604A_16_P03088011	1.87460267543793A_16_P01731486	2.3493857383728A_16_P18379639	2.59332513809204A_16_P37656903	2.0244026184082A_16_P00109274	2.53533673286438A_16_P21144551	1.53002858161926A_16_P01809575	2.3493857383728A_14_P123460	2.07481455802917!sample_table_end
