Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511248/suppl/GSM511248.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.07281303405762A_16_P19392987	1.54195058345795A_16_P03557828	2.06169509887695A_16_P17733714	2.04393196105957A_16_P02790515	1.85937678813934A_16_P20786376	2.02452111244202A_16_P16999641	1.62921988964081A_16_P19986597	1.39847850799561A_16_P16448006	1.45039987564087A_16_P15473371	2.57921719551086A_16_P37089307	1.80925559997559A_16_P18472600	2.154292345047A_16_P03088011	1.89873051643372A_16_P01731486	2.74843525886536A_16_P18379639	1.98561453819275A_16_P37656903	1.34393990039825A_16_P00109274	1.81756949424744A_16_P21144551	2.15761852264404A_16_P01809575	1.89549696445465A_14_P123460	1.54024112224579!sample_table_end
