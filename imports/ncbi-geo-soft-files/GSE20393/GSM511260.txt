Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511260/suppl/GSM511260.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.83978259563446A_16_P19392987	1.72041797637939A_16_P03557828	1.84577739238739A_16_P17733714	1.77257657051086A_16_P02790515	1.76520109176636A_16_P20786376	1.7972617149353A_16_P16999641	2.98715925216675A_16_P19986597	1.5476998090744A_16_P16448006	2.06973505020142A_16_P15473371	2.84747195243835A_16_P37089307	1.93575727939606A_16_P18472600	1.86963212490082A_16_P03088011	1.88429236412048A_16_P01731486	2.38221192359924A_16_P18379639	1.62765324115753A_16_P37656903	1.51644587516785A_16_P00109274	1.95484805107117A_16_P21144551	2.30421042442322A_16_P01809575	1.96914041042328A_14_P123460	1.71551406383514!sample_table_end
