Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511583/suppl/GSM511583.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.21878814697266A_16_P19392987	2.07052516937256A_16_P03557828	1.33985829353333A_16_P17733714	1.59586024284363A_16_P02790515	1.30871617794037A_16_P20786376	2.38244867324829A_16_P16999641	1.7956337928772A_16_P19986597	1.80820441246033A_16_P16448006	6.48275804519653A_16_P15473371	2.30663990974426A_16_P37089307	2.43169784545898A_16_P18472600	2.16797780990601A_16_P03088011	2.07882857322693A_16_P01731486	2.31929469108582A_16_P18379639	1.86841833591461A_16_P37656903	1.42418885231018A_16_P00109274	1.35097980499268A_16_P21144551	1.92043685913086A_16_P01809575	1.73563015460968A_14_P123460	1.99874699115753!sample_table_end
