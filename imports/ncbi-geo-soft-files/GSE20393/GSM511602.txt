Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511602/suppl/GSM511602.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.18371319770813A_16_P19392987	2.16824746131897A_16_P03557828	2.30782651901245A_16_P17733714	1.95206820964813A_16_P02790515	1.51311826705933A_16_P20786376	2.23552894592285A_16_P16999641	1.52352643013A_16_P19986597	1.96168029308319A_16_P16448006	3.04444432258606A_16_P15473371	2.11426687240601A_16_P37089307	2.13730621337891A_16_P18472600	2.90679168701172A_16_P03088011	2.10019636154175A_16_P01731486	1.8287068605423A_16_P18379639	2.90679168701172A_16_P37656903	1.51770353317261A_16_P00109274	2.17967462539673A_16_P21144551	2.87536025047302A_16_P01809575	1.55349981784821A_14_P123460	2.63860535621643!sample_table_end
