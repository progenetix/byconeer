Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511467/suppl/GSM511467.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.10613894462585A_16_P19392987	1.9337592124939A_16_P03557828	1.78246343135834A_16_P17733714	2.00127553939819A_16_P02790515	1.72664487361908A_16_P20786376	2.22774314880371A_16_P16999641	1.97527766227722A_16_P19986597	1.77491331100464A_16_P16448006	1.90896701812744A_16_P15473371	2.15336537361145A_16_P37089307	1.8112108707428A_16_P18472600	2.06350564956665A_16_P03088011	2.23108530044556A_16_P01731486	2.45580554008484A_16_P18379639	1.79047060012817A_16_P37656903	1.78098130226135A_16_P00109274	1.73862135410309A_16_P21144551	2.74950742721558A_16_P01809575	2.41675114631653A_14_P123460	1.96368229389191!sample_table_end
