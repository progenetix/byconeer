Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511453/suppl/GSM511453.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.0447039604187A_16_P19392987	2.0591139793396A_16_P03557828	2.06665706634521A_16_P17733714	2.063392162323A_16_P02790515	1.55807483196259A_16_P20786376	2.05372357368469A_16_P16999641	2.05092763900757A_16_P19986597	2.05930137634277A_16_P16448006	2.0619592666626A_16_P15473371	2.05773425102234A_16_P37089307	2.05621552467346A_16_P18472600	2.06464028358459A_16_P03088011	2.0600893497467A_16_P01731486	2.06647920608521A_16_P18379639	2.4825587272644A_16_P37656903	2.05603551864624A_16_P00109274	2.06302261352539A_16_P21144551	2.0646288394928A_16_P01809575	2.06647920608521A_14_P123460	2.05930137634277!sample_table_end
