Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511607/suppl/GSM511607.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.10039091110229A_16_P19392987	2.01573061943054A_16_P03557828	1.63653314113617A_16_P17733714	1.98352360725403A_16_P02790515	1.86132025718689A_16_P20786376	1.66908478736877A_16_P16999641	1.47167491912842A_16_P19986597	1.90262794494629A_16_P16448006	2.16866636276245A_16_P15473371	2.1826868057251A_16_P37089307	2.20942330360413A_16_P18472600	2.98137998580933A_16_P03088011	2.40486192703247A_16_P01731486	2.19473052024841A_16_P18379639	2.12573337554932A_16_P37656903	1.90622365474701A_16_P00109274	1.88446712493896A_16_P21144551	2.27370548248291A_16_P01809575	2.04238796234131A_14_P123460	1.90262794494629!sample_table_end
