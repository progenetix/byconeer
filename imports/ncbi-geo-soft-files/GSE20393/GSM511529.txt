Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511529/suppl/GSM511529.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.61531090736389A_16_P19392987	1.40124320983887A_16_P03557828	1.16725254058838A_16_P17733714	1.44973647594452A_16_P02790515	1.07927107810974A_16_P20786376	2.41946649551392A_16_P16999641	1.91772449016571A_16_P19986597	1.95331919193268A_16_P16448006	2.11589574813843A_16_P15473371	2.31240129470825A_16_P37089307	3.19294261932373A_16_P18472600	4.70742082595825A_16_P03088011	1.16504466533661A_16_P01731486	2.64699125289917A_16_P18379639	1.87317311763763A_16_P37656903	2.24927115440369A_16_P00109274	1.18052363395691A_16_P21144551	2.74218559265137A_16_P01809575	3.01434969902039A_14_P123460	2.86794710159302!sample_table_end
