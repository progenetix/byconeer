Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511488/suppl/GSM511488.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.05866146087646A_16_P19392987	2.07118916511536A_16_P03557828	2.50307536125183A_16_P17733714	2.05537509918213A_16_P02790515	2.00188255310059A_16_P20786376	2.0602445602417A_16_P16999641	1.93123865127563A_16_P19986597	2.0597550868988A_16_P16448006	2.06195449829102A_16_P15473371	2.00816941261292A_16_P37089307	2.05363965034485A_16_P18472600	1.971062541008A_16_P03088011	2.56641244888306A_16_P01731486	2.04237174987793A_16_P18379639	1.971062541008A_16_P37656903	2.02767777442932A_16_P00109274	2.05730080604553A_16_P21144551	2.2627739906311A_16_P01809575	2.08874702453613A_14_P123460	2.09549689292908!sample_table_end
