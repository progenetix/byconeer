Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511589/suppl/GSM511589.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	3.3132803440094A_16_P19392987	1.94539868831635A_16_P03557828	1.4758894443512A_16_P17733714	1.54131174087524A_16_P02790515	0.593603849411011A_16_P20786376	1.99239468574524A_16_P16999641	2.0020387172699A_16_P19986597	3.37038087844849A_16_P16448006	2.43028378486633A_16_P15473371	2.02743554115295A_16_P37089307	1.92779934406281A_16_P18472600	2.46348524093628A_16_P03088011	1.50906181335449A_16_P01731486	2.38865113258362A_16_P18379639	2.46348524093628A_16_P37656903	2.46616435050964A_16_P00109274	2.01190996170044A_16_P21144551	2.76234078407288A_16_P01809575	2.43849849700928A_14_P123460	3.28564834594727!sample_table_end
