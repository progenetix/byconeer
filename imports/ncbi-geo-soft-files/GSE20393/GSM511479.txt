Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511479/suppl/GSM511479.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.87440621852875A_16_P19392987	1.94333302974701A_16_P03557828	1.69612979888916A_16_P17733714	1.26403868198395A_16_P02790515	1.55315780639648A_16_P20786376	2.35629487037659A_16_P16999641	1.75788629055023A_16_P19986597	1.59833443164825A_16_P16448006	1.72390103340149A_16_P15473371	3.14061427116394A_16_P37089307	1.62191259860992A_16_P18472600	2.35539221763611A_16_P03088011	2.24374794960022A_16_P01731486	3.51540064811707A_16_P18379639	2.08680129051208A_16_P37656903	1.1661856174469A_16_P00109274	1.18394768238068A_16_P21144551	2.77636337280273A_16_P01809575	2.75180315971375A_14_P123460	1.76665723323822!sample_table_end
