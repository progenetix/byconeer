Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511544/suppl/GSM511544.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.24673104286194A_16_P19392987	2.16160821914673A_16_P03557828	1.25076496601105A_16_P17733714	1.24366199970245A_16_P02790515	1.24161446094513A_16_P20786376	1.23884499073029A_16_P16999641	1.24562740325928A_16_P19986597	2.14213418960571A_16_P16448006	2.16514253616333A_16_P15473371	2.15121459960938A_16_P37089307	3.06366372108459A_16_P18472600	3.08936262130737A_16_P03088011	2.15868449211121A_16_P01731486	2.16939568519592A_16_P18379639	2.16829538345337A_16_P37656903	2.16571807861328A_16_P00109274	2.17081642150879A_16_P21144551	2.16286015510559A_16_P01809575	2.16463613510132A_14_P123460	2.14213418960571!sample_table_end
