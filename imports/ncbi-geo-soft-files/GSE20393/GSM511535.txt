Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511535/suppl/GSM511535.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.43776416778564A_16_P19392987	2.33927702903748A_16_P03557828	1.78877663612366A_16_P17733714	1.3494907617569A_16_P02790515	2.12796187400818A_16_P20786376	2.6432318687439A_16_P16999641	1.34193980693817A_16_P19986597	2.15948271751404A_16_P16448006	1.85138034820557A_16_P15473371	1.5014830827713A_16_P37089307	2.70936822891235A_16_P18472600	5.32709646224976A_16_P03088011	1.75971662998199A_16_P01731486	3.31812286376953A_16_P18379639	2.22993326187134A_16_P37656903	1.67661440372467A_16_P00109274	2.21278429031372A_16_P21144551	2.26476240158081A_16_P01809575	3.25320601463318A_14_P123460	1.3782080411911!sample_table_end
