Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511596/suppl/GSM511596.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.74262273311615A_16_P19392987	2.01945686340332A_16_P03557828	1.89804792404175A_16_P17733714	1.72857069969177A_16_P02790515	2.17433953285217A_16_P20786376	2.09499311447144A_16_P16999641	1.72511005401611A_16_P19986597	2.07942414283752A_16_P16448006	2.66433429718018A_16_P15473371	2.20983409881592A_16_P37089307	1.79757344722748A_16_P18472600	2.22777080535889A_16_P03088011	2.01733493804932A_16_P01731486	2.67540216445923A_16_P18379639	2.00331878662109A_16_P37656903	1.73122024536133A_16_P00109274	1.72936272621155A_16_P21144551	2.23085284233093A_16_P01809575	2.67159271240234A_14_P123460	2.08132672309875!sample_table_end
