Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511301/suppl/GSM511301.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.2842960357666A_16_P19392987	1.28854334354401A_16_P03557828	2.23851132392883A_16_P17733714	1.29052674770355A_16_P02790515	2.21347117424011A_16_P20786376	2.23531460762024A_16_P16999641	2.67030739784241A_16_P19986597	2.24775052070618A_16_P16448006	2.23646259307861A_16_P15473371	1.76515054702759A_16_P37089307	2.23797249794006A_16_P18472600	2.98889446258545A_16_P03088011	1.75719475746155A_16_P01731486	2.23901987075806A_16_P18379639	4.76701164245605A_16_P37656903	1.8529896736145A_16_P00109274	1.76447629928589A_16_P21144551	2.33024930953979A_16_P01809575	2.23901987075806A_14_P123460	2.25108647346497!sample_table_end
