Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511549/suppl/GSM511549.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.57120370864868A_16_P19392987	2.15812706947327A_16_P03557828	2.03886604309082A_16_P17733714	2.16356158256531A_16_P02790515	1.67471301555634A_16_P20786376	2.2055869102478A_16_P16999641	1.72397792339325A_16_P19986597	2.38150548934937A_16_P16448006	2.31951880455017A_16_P15473371	2.65989995002747A_16_P37089307	2.73819017410278A_16_P18472600	3.36404347419739A_16_P03088011	1.66206729412079A_16_P01731486	2.14620208740234A_16_P18379639	1.76236057281494A_16_P37656903	1.59730327129364A_16_P00109274	2.15365600585938A_16_P21144551	2.21310782432556A_16_P01809575	2.85620927810669A_14_P123460	1.98290145397186!sample_table_end
