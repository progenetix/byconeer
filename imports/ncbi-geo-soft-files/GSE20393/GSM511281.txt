Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511281/suppl/GSM511281.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.92782819271088A_16_P19392987	1.98212277889252A_16_P03557828	1.9060218334198A_16_P17733714	1.88664638996124A_16_P02790515	1.83613860607147A_16_P20786376	2.13433027267456A_16_P16999641	1.7148962020874A_16_P19986597	1.83302283287048A_16_P16448006	1.93667531013489A_16_P15473371	2.51701354980469A_16_P37089307	1.8694874048233A_16_P18472600	1.94589519500732A_16_P03088011	1.90636169910431A_16_P01731486	2.19008493423462A_16_P18379639	1.91272115707397A_16_P37656903	1.92100346088409A_16_P00109274	1.42817413806915A_16_P21144551	1.90219759941101A_16_P01809575	1.95366752147675A_14_P123460	2.00083684921265!sample_table_end
