Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511475/suppl/GSM511475.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.06909346580505A_16_P19392987	1.20088446140289A_16_P03557828	1.79060161113739A_16_P17733714	2.08886122703552A_16_P02790515	1.7507199048996A_16_P20786376	2.20783066749573A_16_P16999641	1.9175820350647A_16_P19986597	1.82741045951843A_16_P16448006	2.73809051513672A_16_P15473371	2.16278886795044A_16_P37089307	2.59469199180603A_16_P18472600	2.11563611030579A_16_P03088011	2.54272818565369A_16_P01731486	3.18764615058899A_16_P18379639	1.86158072948456A_16_P37656903	1.84867107868195A_16_P00109274	1.82278323173523A_16_P21144551	3.88911628723145A_16_P01809575	3.17672538757324A_14_P123460	2.01051115989685!sample_table_end
