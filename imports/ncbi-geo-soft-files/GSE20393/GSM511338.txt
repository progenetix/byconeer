Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511338/suppl/GSM511338.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.755739569664A_16_P19392987	1.97747993469238A_16_P03557828	2.05687999725342A_16_P17733714	1.87763917446136A_16_P02790515	1.50197446346283A_16_P20786376	1.68784093856812A_16_P16999641	1.68120670318604A_16_P19986597	1.70619320869446A_16_P16448006	2.47080397605896A_16_P15473371	2.67353200912476A_16_P37089307	2.63938164710999A_16_P18472600	3.01523947715759A_16_P03088011	1.72460532188416A_16_P01731486	2.49897933006287A_16_P18379639	2.90238833427429A_16_P37656903	1.86413133144379A_16_P00109274	2.01397752761841A_16_P21144551	2.43200707435608A_16_P01809575	2.69218897819519A_14_P123460	1.7316929101944!sample_table_end
