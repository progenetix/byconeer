Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511312/suppl/GSM511312.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.14625883102417A_16_P19392987	1.61320471763611A_16_P03557828	2.08791637420654A_16_P17733714	2.32619071006775A_16_P02790515	1.60385370254517A_16_P20786376	2.1795973777771A_16_P16999641	1.57610332965851A_16_P19986597	2.1792459487915A_16_P16448006	2.68601751327515A_16_P15473371	2.531893491745A_16_P37089307	2.11044311523438A_16_P18472600	2.2567126750946A_16_P03088011	2.37734532356262A_16_P01731486	2.54132175445557A_16_P18379639	2.20964193344116A_16_P37656903	2.11202049255371A_16_P00109274	1.92703378200531A_16_P21144551	2.14075040817261A_16_P01809575	1.65703475475311A_14_P123460	1.61660408973694!sample_table_end
