Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511474/suppl/GSM511474.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.32354640960693A_16_P19392987	2.19741559028625A_16_P03557828	1.29165816307068A_16_P17733714	1.43406295776367A_16_P02790515	2.14158463478088A_16_P20786376	2.82426190376282A_16_P16999641	1.40981769561768A_16_P19986597	2.02834820747375A_16_P16448006	1.84587669372559A_16_P15473371	2.27889919281006A_16_P37089307	1.29653263092041A_16_P18472600	3.62885570526123A_16_P03088011	2.1845817565918A_16_P01731486	2.74577450752258A_16_P18379639	1.85044646263123A_16_P37656903	1.30331861972809A_16_P00109274	1.25472235679626A_16_P21144551	3.31171441078186A_16_P01809575	2.13509631156921A_14_P123460	1.38235402107239!sample_table_end
