Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511252/suppl/GSM511252.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.92545771598816A_16_P19392987	1.6800149679184A_16_P03557828	1.01195275783539A_16_P17733714	5.02642917633057A_16_P02790515	1.86393654346466A_16_P20786376	1.92651808261871A_16_P16999641	1.65416264533997A_16_P19986597	1.79819226264954A_16_P16448006	2.20545053482056A_16_P15473371	3.81926345825195A_16_P37089307	1.86850309371948A_16_P18472600	2.04874038696289A_16_P03088011	1.94971787929535A_16_P01731486	2.24939894676208A_16_P18379639	1.65936803817749A_16_P37656903	4.07795858383179A_16_P00109274	1.63267409801483A_16_P21144551	2.07179808616638A_16_P01809575	2.36102843284607A_14_P123460	1.96927201747894!sample_table_end
