Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511311/suppl/GSM511311.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.04915142059326A_16_P19392987	2.04654383659363A_16_P03557828	1.95560324192047A_16_P17733714	1.63424265384674A_16_P02790515	1.99551284313202A_16_P20786376	1.45686459541321A_16_P16999641	2.00360679626465A_16_P19986597	1.64084219932556A_16_P16448006	1.24035143852234A_16_P15473371	3.01447796821594A_16_P37089307	1.71415770053864A_16_P18472600	5.62469530105591A_16_P03088011	1.65195274353027A_16_P01731486	1.95603179931641A_16_P18379639	4.92127275466919A_16_P37656903	1.63424265384674A_16_P00109274	1.64067387580872A_16_P21144551	2.42551064491272A_16_P01809575	1.88710570335388A_14_P123460	1.64084219932556!sample_table_end
