Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511291/suppl/GSM511291.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.66524422168732A_16_P19392987	1.56840705871582A_16_P03557828	2.14142274856567A_16_P17733714	2.04677224159241A_16_P02790515	1.40814280509949A_16_P20786376	2.17061996459961A_16_P16999641	1.93978714942932A_16_P19986597	1.77766478061676A_16_P16448006	1.89917421340942A_16_P15473371	2.28120565414429A_16_P37089307	1.83157980442047A_16_P18472600	4.15263223648071A_16_P03088011	1.77103555202484A_16_P01731486	2.37623047828674A_16_P18379639	3.64751076698303A_16_P37656903	2.15484619140625A_16_P00109274	1.52940273284912A_16_P21144551	1.74383115768433A_16_P01809575	1.9611656665802A_14_P123460	1.96462428569794!sample_table_end
