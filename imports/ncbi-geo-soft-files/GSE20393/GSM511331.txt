Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511331/suppl/GSM511331.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.95318245887756A_16_P19392987	1.94414973258972A_16_P03557828	1.94799482822418A_16_P17733714	1.94567537307739A_16_P02790515	1.94277143478394A_16_P20786376	1.93866395950317A_16_P16999641	1.94091188907623A_16_P19986597	1.94740200042725A_16_P16448006	1.94327187538147A_16_P15473371	2.61582660675049A_16_P37089307	1.9435818195343A_16_P18472600	1.94275033473969A_16_P03088011	1.94991278648376A_16_P01731486	1.95023894309998A_16_P18379639	1.94275033473969A_16_P37656903	1.94567537307739A_16_P00109274	1.94511091709137A_16_P21144551	1.95025885105133A_16_P01809575	1.94878244400024A_14_P123460	1.94740200042725!sample_table_end
