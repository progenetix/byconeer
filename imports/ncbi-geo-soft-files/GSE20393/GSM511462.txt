Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511462/suppl/GSM511462.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.02521157264709A_16_P19392987	1.87152194976807A_16_P03557828	1.77604615688324A_16_P17733714	1.49090468883514A_16_P02790515	1.63790392875671A_16_P20786376	2.40989422798157A_16_P16999641	1.87977206707001A_16_P19986597	1.76602566242218A_16_P16448006	1.9659298658371A_16_P15473371	2.64884662628174A_16_P37089307	1.77890694141388A_16_P18472600	2.08993029594421A_16_P03088011	2.33123087882996A_16_P01731486	3.12425255775452A_16_P18379639	1.81125283241272A_16_P37656903	1.27569854259491A_16_P00109274	2.25064373016357A_16_P21144551	2.69015741348267A_16_P01809575	3.33009767532349A_14_P123460	2.0274543762207!sample_table_end
