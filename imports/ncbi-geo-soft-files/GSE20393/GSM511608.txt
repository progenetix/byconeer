Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511608/suppl/GSM511608.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.95018935203552A_16_P19392987	2.11502289772034A_16_P03557828	1.17967712879181A_16_P17733714	2.11325883865356A_16_P02790515	1.1788227558136A_16_P20786376	2.17361736297607A_16_P16999641	1.19064426422119A_16_P19986597	4.27429533004761A_16_P16448006	4.03749465942383A_16_P15473371	3.02056384086609A_16_P37089307	1.90673208236694A_16_P18472600	2.17353010177612A_16_P03088011	2.18396806716919A_16_P01731486	2.25154590606689A_16_P18379639	1.98870468139648A_16_P37656903	2.01809239387512A_16_P00109274	1.98870003223419A_16_P21144551	2.19418334960938A_16_P01809575	2.18494272232056A_14_P123460	2.16336631774902!sample_table_end
