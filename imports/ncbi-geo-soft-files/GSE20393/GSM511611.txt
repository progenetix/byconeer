Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511611/suppl/GSM511611.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.93605184555054A_16_P19392987	1.99308276176453A_16_P03557828	2.05180144309998A_16_P17733714	1.9935063123703A_16_P02790515	1.80091667175293A_16_P20786376	2.04363083839417A_16_P16999641	1.8301420211792A_16_P19986597	1.96531391143799A_16_P16448006	2.28831100463867A_16_P15473371	2.2547435760498A_16_P37089307	2.51396584510803A_16_P18472600	2.54266595840454A_16_P03088011	2.20612668991089A_16_P01731486	2.33527207374573A_16_P18379639	2.46425890922546A_16_P37656903	1.99835050106049A_16_P00109274	1.90306568145752A_16_P21144551	2.25536417961121A_16_P01809575	2.17310428619385A_14_P123460	1.96531391143799!sample_table_end
