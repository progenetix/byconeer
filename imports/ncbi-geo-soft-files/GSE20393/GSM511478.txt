Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511478/suppl/GSM511478.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.16145586967468A_16_P19392987	1.94754493236542A_16_P03557828	1.47382926940918A_16_P17733714	1.59476447105408A_16_P02790515	1.69295406341553A_16_P20786376	2.30865454673767A_16_P16999641	1.92308855056763A_16_P19986597	1.42780518531799A_16_P16448006	1.87085688114166A_16_P15473371	2.55390810966492A_16_P37089307	1.76628196239471A_16_P18472600	1.92807400226593A_16_P03088011	1.82054829597473A_16_P01731486	2.58973789215088A_16_P18379639	1.8276846408844A_16_P37656903	1.43625247478485A_16_P00109274	1.94927716255188A_16_P21144551	2.70902872085571A_16_P01809575	2.2346522808075A_14_P123460	1.55852520465851!sample_table_end
