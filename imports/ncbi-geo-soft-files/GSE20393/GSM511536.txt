Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511536/suppl/GSM511536.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.97223901748657A_16_P19392987	1.99283158779144A_16_P03557828	1.78803145885468A_16_P17733714	1.87971079349518A_16_P02790515	1.75310087203979A_16_P20786376	2.10378766059875A_16_P16999641	1.8872709274292A_16_P19986597	1.76042556762695A_16_P16448006	1.86250734329224A_16_P15473371	2.12022304534912A_16_P37089307	1.81195735931396A_16_P18472600	2.06414365768433A_16_P03088011	1.74667835235596A_16_P01731486	2.40314435958862A_16_P18379639	1.76739966869354A_16_P37656903	1.75766980648041A_16_P00109274	1.7028626203537A_16_P21144551	2.17677807807922A_16_P01809575	1.97836315631866A_14_P123460	1.87704885005951!sample_table_end
