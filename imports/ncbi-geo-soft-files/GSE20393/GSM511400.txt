Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511400/suppl/GSM511400.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	3.81985259056091A_16_P19392987	1.68305253982544A_16_P03557828	2.2535035610199A_16_P17733714	2.4353289604187A_16_P02790515	1.6463280916214A_16_P20786376	1.66259479522705A_16_P16999641	1.67147696018219A_16_P19986597	1.96654450893402A_16_P16448006	3.79996514320374A_16_P15473371	2.21456122398376A_16_P37089307	2.25564074516296A_16_P18472600	4.33365535736084A_16_P03088011	2.32395029067993A_16_P01731486	1.96505701541901A_16_P18379639	2.21453166007996A_16_P37656903	2.4014892578125A_16_P00109274	1.95487070083618A_16_P21144551	2.03447794914246A_16_P01809575	1.97513210773468A_14_P123460	1.70369589328766!sample_table_end
