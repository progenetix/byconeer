Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511254/suppl/GSM511254.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.53176283836365A_16_P19392987	1.52487778663635A_16_P03557828	2.5244607925415A_16_P17733714	1.57701814174652A_16_P02790515	1.43942368030548A_16_P20786376	2.8730890750885A_16_P16999641	2.11346292495728A_16_P19986597	2.45297956466675A_16_P16448006	2.59820771217346A_16_P15473371	1.57532858848572A_16_P37089307	2.4912326335907A_16_P18472600	2.78293323516846A_16_P03088011	1.49459326267242A_16_P01731486	1.76606786251068A_16_P18379639	2.54490089416504A_16_P37656903	1.45471608638763A_16_P00109274	1.48080575466156A_16_P21144551	2.79089903831482A_16_P01809575	1.51926255226135A_14_P123460	2.64348483085632!sample_table_end
