Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511578/suppl/GSM511578.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.89146256446838A_16_P19392987	2.1573441028595A_16_P03557828	1.78174066543579A_16_P17733714	2.42061829566956A_16_P02790515	1.7192839384079A_16_P20786376	2.89088654518127A_16_P16999641	1.77228593826294A_16_P19986597	1.54798054695129A_16_P16448006	2.52959442138672A_16_P15473371	2.34597873687744A_16_P37089307	2.92940807342529A_16_P18472600	3.11214423179626A_16_P03088011	1.92395389080048A_16_P01731486	2.42584180831909A_16_P18379639	2.7343156337738A_16_P37656903	2.08683013916016A_16_P00109274	1.82349860668182A_16_P21144551	2.19937539100647A_16_P01809575	2.01329970359802A_14_P123460	1.70471298694611!sample_table_end
