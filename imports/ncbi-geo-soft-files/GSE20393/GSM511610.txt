Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511610/suppl/GSM511610.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.30291342735291A_16_P19392987	2.33672881126404A_16_P03557828	2.32953548431396A_16_P17733714	1.48978495597839A_16_P02790515	1.32013416290283A_16_P20786376	1.92676627635956A_16_P16999641	1.64026093482971A_16_P19986597	1.93848156929016A_16_P16448006	2.36775898933411A_16_P15473371	1.97968018054962A_16_P37089307	3.19711661338806A_16_P18472600	6.94085597991943A_16_P03088011	1.91406035423279A_16_P01731486	2.03371691703796A_16_P18379639	4.47871255874634A_16_P37656903	1.42187809944153A_16_P00109274	1.88983869552612A_16_P21144551	2.87049055099487A_16_P01809575	1.99860334396362A_14_P123460	1.96291470527649!sample_table_end
