Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511482/suppl/GSM511482.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.8130247592926A_16_P19392987	1.68683969974518A_16_P03557828	1.5953277349472A_16_P17733714	2.28652906417847A_16_P02790515	2.03013586997986A_16_P20786376	1.89238977432251A_16_P16999641	1.25273513793945A_16_P19986597	1.53871333599091A_16_P16448006	1.64871490001678A_16_P15473371	2.06372213363647A_16_P37089307	1.56752109527588A_16_P18472600	2.07067012786865A_16_P03088011	2.19291424751282A_16_P01731486	3.8968448638916A_16_P18379639	1.84438323974609A_16_P37656903	2.13026976585388A_16_P00109274	1.51350998878479A_16_P21144551	2.55926561355591A_16_P01809575	3.14263558387756A_14_P123460	1.70263230800629!sample_table_end
