Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511264/suppl/GSM511264.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.28264772891998A_16_P19392987	1.28416800498962A_16_P03557828	1.94762825965881A_16_P17733714	1.27890038490295A_16_P02790515	1.27338337898254A_16_P20786376	2.04539179801941A_16_P16999641	1.28190612792969A_16_P19986597	2.05454182624817A_16_P16448006	2.80858278274536A_16_P15473371	2.8045699596405A_16_P37089307	1.27034604549408A_16_P18472600	2.83049178123474A_16_P03088011	1.92798066139221A_16_P01731486	2.05401802062988A_16_P18379639	2.05054235458374A_16_P37656903	1.27890038490295A_16_P00109274	2.04946804046631A_16_P21144551	2.04817652702332A_16_P01809575	2.03866338729858A_14_P123460	2.05987429618835!sample_table_end
