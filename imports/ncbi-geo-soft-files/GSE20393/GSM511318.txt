Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511318/suppl/GSM511318.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.45593583583832A_16_P19392987	1.53044354915619A_16_P03557828	1.45448327064514A_16_P17733714	1.85256206989288A_16_P02790515	2.0786669254303A_16_P20786376	2.16835236549377A_16_P16999641	2.16233611106873A_16_P19986597	1.62624335289001A_16_P16448006	2.15903687477112A_16_P15473371	2.59717345237732A_16_P37089307	2.7878086566925A_16_P18472600	2.17736577987671A_16_P03088011	1.85218691825867A_16_P01731486	2.18431401252747A_16_P18379639	2.17736577987671A_16_P37656903	1.85256206989288A_16_P00109274	2.17718625068665A_16_P21144551	2.17551374435425A_16_P01809575	2.22368669509888A_14_P123460	1.4922581911087!sample_table_end
