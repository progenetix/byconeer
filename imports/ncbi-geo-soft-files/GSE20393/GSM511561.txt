Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511561/suppl/GSM511561.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.52942621707916A_16_P19392987	1.53919911384583A_16_P03557828	2.3334527015686A_16_P17733714	1.51576840877533A_16_P02790515	1.50809454917908A_16_P20786376	1.51007723808289A_16_P16999641	2.55950951576233A_16_P19986597	2.468510389328A_16_P16448006	3.08390617370605A_16_P15473371	2.47903347015381A_16_P37089307	3.07174682617188A_16_P18472600	4.08226013183594A_16_P03088011	2.03482294082642A_16_P01731486	2.56524109840393A_16_P18379639	4.04681444168091A_16_P37656903	1.49106574058533A_16_P00109274	2.5217080116272A_16_P21144551	2.42912626266479A_16_P01809575	2.68565154075623A_14_P123460	1.94467747211456!sample_table_end
