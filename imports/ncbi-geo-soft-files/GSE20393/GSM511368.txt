Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511368/suppl/GSM511368.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.42826616764069A_16_P19392987	1.74690771102905A_16_P03557828	2.05450296401978A_16_P17733714	1.72032642364502A_16_P02790515	2.35430240631104A_16_P20786376	1.79667174816132A_16_P16999641	1.73800766468048A_16_P19986597	2.06645631790161A_16_P16448006	2.01410245895386A_16_P15473371	3.97258281707764A_16_P37089307	2.05634951591492A_16_P18472600	4.32348394393921A_16_P03088011	2.39966583251953A_16_P01731486	2.12217497825623A_16_P18379639	4.32348394393921A_16_P37656903	2.06653881072998A_16_P00109274	2.37877869606018A_16_P21144551	2.28253388404846A_16_P01809575	2.37826728820801A_14_P123460	1.41830122470856!sample_table_end
