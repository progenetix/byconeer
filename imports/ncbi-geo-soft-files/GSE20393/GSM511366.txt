Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511366/suppl/GSM511366.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.6368100643158A_16_P19392987	1.09841907024384A_16_P03557828	1.0679270029068A_16_P17733714	1.84350538253784A_16_P02790515	1.58503472805023A_16_P20786376	2.12606191635132A_16_P16999641	1.8338623046875A_16_P19986597	1.52187383174896A_16_P16448006	2.07811427116394A_16_P15473371	2.12703704833984A_16_P37089307	2.80074644088745A_16_P18472600	2.2428514957428A_16_P03088011	3.14811563491821A_16_P01731486	2.67830562591553A_16_P18379639	2.19776368141174A_16_P37656903	1.57320773601532A_16_P00109274	1.51624953746796A_16_P21144551	3.04681134223938A_16_P01809575	2.92850971221924A_14_P123460	1.54349911212921!sample_table_end
