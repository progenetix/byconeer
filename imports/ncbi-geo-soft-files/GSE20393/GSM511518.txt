Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511518/suppl/GSM511518.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.43215346336365A_16_P19392987	2.10202622413635A_16_P03557828	1.94606685638428A_16_P17733714	1.37143361568451A_16_P02790515	1.88396346569061A_16_P20786376	2.40904998779297A_16_P16999641	2.01606225967407A_16_P19986597	1.2157187461853A_16_P16448006	3.04214072227478A_16_P15473371	2.19441771507263A_16_P37089307	2.03380632400513A_16_P18472600	3.17307424545288A_16_P03088011	2.77605199813843A_16_P01731486	2.71218490600586A_16_P18379639	2.6327588558197A_16_P37656903	1.94162750244141A_16_P00109274	2.00126767158508A_16_P21144551	2.97515630722046A_16_P01809575	2.11004185676575A_14_P123460	1.32735073566437!sample_table_end
