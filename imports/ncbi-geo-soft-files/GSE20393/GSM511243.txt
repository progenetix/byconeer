Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511243/suppl/GSM511243.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.02320051193237A_16_P19392987	1.48043417930603A_16_P03557828	1.780686378479A_16_P17733714	1.55260896682739A_16_P02790515	1.65437304973602A_16_P20786376	1.91765785217285A_16_P16999641	1.90717661380768A_16_P19986597	1.71043968200684A_16_P16448006	1.85246813297272A_16_P15473371	2.86248564720154A_16_P37089307	1.76777684688568A_16_P18472600	2.61295819282532A_16_P03088011	1.78372251987457A_16_P01731486	2.43237638473511A_16_P18379639	2.21225261688232A_16_P37656903	1.51104354858398A_16_P00109274	1.67161858081818A_16_P21144551	2.44163274765015A_16_P01809575	1.85010468959808A_14_P123460	1.89048850536346!sample_table_end
