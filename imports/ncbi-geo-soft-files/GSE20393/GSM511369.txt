Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511369/suppl/GSM511369.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.88472425937653A_16_P19392987	1.79889571666718A_16_P03557828	1.80553078651428A_16_P17733714	2.74573397636414A_16_P02790515	2.64498353004456A_16_P20786376	2.17940187454224A_16_P16999641	2.07153940200806A_16_P19986597	1.52481842041016A_16_P16448006	2.9115252494812A_16_P15473371	2.15345215797424A_16_P37089307	2.46544814109802A_16_P18472600	6.02572298049927A_16_P03088011	2.7116584777832A_16_P01731486	2.61380052566528A_16_P18379639	3.63416194915771A_16_P37656903	2.66947984695435A_16_P00109274	2.11690258979797A_16_P21144551	1.61367690563202A_16_P01809575	2.61139416694641A_14_P123460	1.52481842041016!sample_table_end
