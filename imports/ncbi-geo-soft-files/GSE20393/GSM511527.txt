Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511527/suppl/GSM511527.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.78364968299866A_16_P19392987	1.87103950977325A_16_P03557828	1.82849764823914A_16_P17733714	2.03565812110901A_16_P02790515	1.70662665367126A_16_P20786376	2.38980746269226A_16_P16999641	1.86644017696381A_16_P19986597	1.7187203168869A_16_P16448006	1.92318844795227A_16_P15473371	2.77262449264526A_16_P37089307	1.739741563797A_16_P18472600	2.01942706108093A_16_P03088011	1.68323910236359A_16_P01731486	2.4877622127533A_16_P18379639	1.74875903129578A_16_P37656903	1.79153001308441A_16_P00109274	1.69760048389435A_16_P21144551	2.06354165077209A_16_P01809575	1.8438503742218A_14_P123460	1.94860780239105!sample_table_end
