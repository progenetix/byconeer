Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511523/suppl/GSM511523.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.19800305366516A_16_P19392987	2.06288981437683A_16_P03557828	1.44033253192902A_16_P17733714	2.02209091186523A_16_P02790515	1.35998356342316A_16_P20786376	1.69138085842133A_16_P16999641	1.54767990112305A_16_P19986597	1.86052989959717A_16_P16448006	2.5645706653595A_16_P15473371	2.88240504264832A_16_P37089307	1.37295937538147A_16_P18472600	3.13784050941467A_16_P03088011	1.95719754695892A_16_P01731486	1.90810370445251A_16_P18379639	1.91685402393341A_16_P37656903	1.94537603855133A_16_P00109274	2.01652717590332A_16_P21144551	2.30243563652039A_16_P01809575	2.65991449356079A_14_P123460	1.5071257352829!sample_table_end
