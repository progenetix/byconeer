Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511403/suppl/GSM511403.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.63580095767975A_16_P19392987	1.82646429538727A_16_P03557828	1.69879543781281A_16_P17733714	2.76842617988586A_16_P02790515	1.34462225437164A_16_P20786376	2.23342418670654A_16_P16999641	1.69943785667419A_16_P19986597	1.28079795837402A_16_P16448006	3.12672424316406A_16_P15473371	1.79443025588989A_16_P37089307	4.09714126586914A_16_P18472600	2.79226803779602A_16_P03088011	1.71387898921967A_16_P01731486	1.99874234199524A_16_P18379639	2.08798170089722A_16_P37656903	2.27989149093628A_16_P00109274	2.22074007987976A_16_P21144551	1.83698964118958A_16_P01809575	2.24487853050232A_14_P123460	1.61185193061829!sample_table_end
