Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511393/suppl/GSM511393.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.97800493240356A_16_P19392987	1.96357572078705A_16_P03557828	1.96780979633331A_16_P17733714	1.98097848892212A_16_P02790515	1.98326253890991A_16_P20786376	1.97104012966156A_16_P16999641	1.99097490310669A_16_P19986597	1.98130619525909A_16_P16448006	1.97995626926422A_16_P15473371	2.63037395477295A_16_P37089307	1.98061084747314A_16_P18472600	1.97583293914795A_16_P03088011	1.96332013607025A_16_P01731486	1.97429716587067A_16_P18379639	1.97583293914795A_16_P37656903	1.98097848892212A_16_P00109274	1.9822826385498A_16_P21144551	1.95550179481506A_16_P01809575	1.97429716587067A_14_P123460	1.98130619525909!sample_table_end
