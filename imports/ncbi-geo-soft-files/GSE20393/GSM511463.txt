Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511463/suppl/GSM511463.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.80032527446747A_16_P19392987	1.66631519794464A_16_P03557828	1.88754677772522A_16_P17733714	2.07689666748047A_16_P02790515	1.81230139732361A_16_P20786376	2.39215016365051A_16_P16999641	2.15366077423096A_16_P19986597	1.86715805530548A_16_P16448006	1.64196634292603A_16_P15473371	2.18210864067078A_16_P37089307	1.8932865858078A_16_P18472600	2.18289828300476A_16_P03088011	1.98367989063263A_16_P01731486	2.98562836647034A_16_P18379639	1.95105791091919A_16_P37656903	1.90094661712646A_16_P00109274	1.95973098278046A_16_P21144551	2.31071472167969A_16_P01809575	2.39581894874573A_14_P123460	1.69457924365997!sample_table_end
