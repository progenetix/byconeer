Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511361/suppl/GSM511361.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.39418053627014A_16_P19392987	2.38976430892944A_16_P03557828	1.30594086647034A_16_P17733714	1.80204832553864A_16_P02790515	1.28935766220093A_16_P20786376	2.47195816040039A_16_P16999641	1.11092066764832A_16_P19986597	1.89405250549316A_16_P16448006	2.39251112937927A_16_P15473371	2.83634757995605A_16_P37089307	1.31971025466919A_16_P18472600	3.40097880363464A_16_P03088011	1.36039292812347A_16_P01731486	1.50807166099548A_16_P18379639	4.29474878311157A_16_P37656903	2.23576688766479A_16_P00109274	1.79862546920776A_16_P21144551	1.90910017490387A_16_P01809575	1.38444244861603A_14_P123460	1.89522814750671!sample_table_end
