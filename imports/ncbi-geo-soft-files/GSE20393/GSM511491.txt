Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511491/suppl/GSM511491.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.8359546661377A_16_P19392987	1.62848925590515A_16_P03557828	2.16385698318481A_16_P17733714	1.65273976325989A_16_P02790515	1.60911405086517A_16_P20786376	2.09892916679382A_16_P16999641	1.79486453533173A_16_P19986597	2.119384765625A_16_P16448006	1.82013344764709A_16_P15473371	2.65458059310913A_16_P37089307	2.00325298309326A_16_P18472600	3.95097923278809A_16_P03088011	2.08379006385803A_16_P01731486	2.06749176979065A_16_P18379639	2.46969199180603A_16_P37656903	1.65273976325989A_16_P00109274	1.80101668834686A_16_P21144551	2.18888235092163A_16_P01809575	2.06644058227539A_14_P123460	2.14430594444275!sample_table_end
