Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511285/suppl/GSM511285.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.0507390499115A_16_P19392987	1.92324006557465A_16_P03557828	1.85982835292816A_16_P17733714	1.38787460327148A_16_P02790515	1.30629789829254A_16_P20786376	2.1454005241394A_16_P16999641	2.36494088172913A_16_P19986597	1.77877020835876A_16_P16448006	1.92677581310272A_16_P15473371	2.10588908195496A_16_P37089307	1.83141720294952A_16_P18472600	3.49725008010864A_16_P03088011	1.88594090938568A_16_P01731486	2.28555297851562A_16_P18379639	3.17221903800964A_16_P37656903	1.23937273025513A_16_P00109274	1.77744030952454A_16_P21144551	2.13353943824768A_16_P01809575	1.90949845314026A_14_P123460	1.92140352725983!sample_table_end
