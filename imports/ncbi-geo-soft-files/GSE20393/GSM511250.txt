Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511250/suppl/GSM511250.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.83877050876617A_16_P19392987	1.21343517303467A_16_P03557828	1.85453486442566A_16_P17733714	2.02295923233032A_16_P02790515	1.75521016120911A_16_P20786376	2.20287775993347A_16_P16999641	2.45251870155334A_16_P19986597	1.74929440021515A_16_P16448006	1.93196880817413A_16_P15473371	3.10722756385803A_16_P37089307	1.78824889659882A_16_P18472600	4.31042337417603A_16_P03088011	7.17954587936401A_16_P01731486	2.33643841743469A_16_P18379639	3.68271207809448A_16_P37656903	1.8124748468399A_16_P00109274	2.03827309608459A_16_P21144551	2.08546733856201A_16_P01809575	1.90008103847504A_14_P123460	2.36974668502808!sample_table_end
