Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511590/suppl/GSM511590.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	1.6206728219986A_16_P19392987	2.42161583900452A_16_P03557828	1.87404692173004A_16_P17733714	1.61439096927643A_16_P02790515	2.23054480552673A_16_P20786376	1.61054396629333A_16_P16999641	1.56340110301971A_16_P19986597	1.57942736148834A_16_P16448006	2.36297345161438A_16_P15473371	2.07762122154236A_16_P37089307	3.18353533744812A_16_P18472600	4.05340051651001A_16_P03088011	1.68706405162811A_16_P01731486	2.38929605484009A_16_P18379639	3.09223580360413A_16_P37656903	2.35775065422058A_16_P00109274	2.46033525466919A_16_P21144551	2.44326639175415A_16_P01809575	1.62887966632843A_14_P123460	1.62583899497986!sample_table_end
