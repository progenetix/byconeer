Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM511nnn/GSM511567/suppl/GSM511567.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20393!Sample_series_id = GSE23768!Sample_data_row_count = 236385#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_16_P39280565	2.03620982170105A_16_P19392987	2.06309771537781A_16_P03557828	1.51674842834473A_16_P17733714	1.99328899383545A_16_P02790515	1.70705723762512A_16_P20786376	2.31553411483765A_16_P16999641	1.65688133239746A_16_P19986597	1.96770286560059A_16_P16448006	2.85218691825867A_16_P15473371	2.51652598381042A_16_P37089307	1.48973643779755A_16_P18472600	2.65258049964905A_16_P03088011	2.04553508758545A_16_P01731486	2.41798090934753A_16_P18379639	1.66205823421478A_16_P37656903	1.84670329093933A_16_P00109274	1.55540108680725A_16_P21144551	2.37886762619019A_16_P01809575	2.03906798362732A_14_P123460	1.66668152809143!sample_table_end
