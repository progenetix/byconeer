Genomic DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors was isolated by use of the Quiagen DNA Blood Midi-Kit (Hilden, Germany).!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA (300-500 ng) was labeled with Cy3-labeled dCTP (tumor) or Cy5-conjugated dCTP (control) by use of a BioPrime DNA Labeling Kit (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Unincorporated nucleotides, random primers, and dyes were removed by use of MicroCon YM30 Spin Columns (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany). Incorporation of dyes into the labeled DNA was determined by UV spectrophotometry.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Pooled lymphocyte DNA from 10 healthy individuals (age 25-40 years)!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: pooled DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of ten healthy donors!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Genomic DNA from tumor tissue was isolated using the Blood and Cell Culture Kit (Qiagen,Hilden, Germany) following the instructions of the suppliers.

Incorporation of dyes into the labeled DNA was determined by UV spectrophotometry.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Ten micrograms each of tumor and reference DNA were combined with 300Âµg of human Cot-1 DNA (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and suspended in 125Âµl of UltrahybTM hybridization buffer (Ambion, Bad Soden, Germany). Denaturation of combined DNA was performed at 75Â°C for 10 min, followed by preannealing at 37Â°C for 30 min. Hybridization was carried out in a GeneTAC Hybridization Station (Genomic Solutions, Oberhaching, Germany) for 36 hr at 37Â°C. Slides were washed with 2Ã SSC/0.05% Tween-20 at 37Â°C for 1 cycle, 2Ã SSC/0.05% Tween-20 at 44Â°C for 2 cycles, 50% formamide/2Ã SSC/0.1% Tween-20 at 44Â°C for 3 cycles, 2Ã SSC/0.05% Tween-20 at 44Â°C for 2 cycles, and finally 1Ã PBS/0.05% Tween-20 at 25Â°C for 2 cycles. Slides were dried by centrifugation at 54 g for 1 min, followed by centrifugation at 216 g for 1 min in a clinical centrifuge.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned at a 5Âµm resolution with an Axon 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, USA) and images analyzed using GenePix Pro 6.0 software (Axon Instruments).!Sample_scan_protocol = Results files containing all relevant raw data were processed by use of ChipYard microarray analysis platform software (developed in-house), the statistical programming language R, and packages of the Bioconductor project; Ihaka and Gentleman, 1996).!Sample_description = Comparison of tumor DNA (Cy3-labeled) vs. normal DNA (Cy5-labeled).
