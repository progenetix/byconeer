Digestion was subsequently verified via agarose gel. DNA samples were labeled using the Bioprime CGH kit (Invitrogen): 13 uL of each digestion was combined with 20 uL 2.5X random primers and incubated at 99C for 5 minutes. Reactions were subsequently snap-cooled on ice. 5 uL Cy5-dUTP (tumor) or Cy3-dUTP (control) (GE Healthcare) was added along with 1 uL Exo-Klenow; reactions were mixed an incubated at 37C for 2 hours. Reactions were stopped with 5 uL stop buffer and cleaned over a Vivaspin 500 column (Sartorious Goettingen, Germany).!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Normal Female DNA!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = 'Gender: female'!Sample_biomaterial_provider_ch2 = Promega!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Procured from Promega, Inc.!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = 800 ng tumor DNA or normal female control DNA (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) was digested with 1 uL AluI (10U/uL; Invitrogen, Carlsbad,!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = CA) and 1 uL Rsa I (10U/uL; Invitrogen) in 13.33 uL total volume at 37C for 2 hours, followed by heat inactivation at 65C for 10 minutes.

Probe mixtures were denatured via boiling 3 minutes, followed by pre-incubation at 37C for 30 minutes. Probes were added to arrays and arrays were hybridized in a rotating oven (Agilent) at 65C for 48 hours at 10 RPM. Arrays were washed for 5 minutes in CGH Wash Buffer 1 (0.5X SSPE, 0.005% NLauroylsarcosine) at room temperature, 12 minutes in CGH Wash 2 (0.1X SSPE, 0.005% NLauroylsarcosine) at 37C, and 1 minute in Stabilization and Drying Solution (Agilent) at room temperature.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned using an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner at 10 micron resolution. !Sample_description = n/a!Sample_data_processing = Data was extracted using Agilent Feature Extraction Software v9.1.1 using default CGH extraction parameters (Agilent Protocol CGH-v4_91).!Sample_platform_id = GPL2873!Sample_contact_name = Kevin,,Brown!Sample_contact_email = kmbrown@tgen.org!Sample_contact_institute = TGen!Sample_contact_address = 445 N.
