Digestion was subsequently verified via agarose gel. DNA samples were labeled using the Bioprime CGH kit (Invitrogen): 13 uL of each digestion was combined with 20 uL 2.5X random primers and incubated at 99C for 5 minutes. Reactions were subsequently snap-cooled on ice. 5 uL Cy5-dUTP (tumor) or Cy3-dUTP (control) (GE Healthcare) was added along with 1 uL Exo-Klenow; reactions were mixed an incubated at 37C for 2 hours.

Probe mixtures were denatured via boiling 3 minutes, followed by pre-incubation at 37C for 30 minutes. Probes were added to arrays and arrays were hybridized in a rotating oven (Agilent) at 65C for 48 hours at 10 RPM.
