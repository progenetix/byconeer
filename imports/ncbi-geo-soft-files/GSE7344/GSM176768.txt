Digestion was subsequently verified via agarose gel. DNA samples were labeled using the Bioprime CGH kit (Invitrogen): 13 uL of each digestion was combined with 20 uL 2.5X random primers and incubated at 99C for 5 minutes. Reactions were subsequently snap-cooled on ice. 5 uL Cy5-dUTP (tumor) or Cy3-dUTP (control) (GE Healthcare) was added along with 1 uL Exo-Klenow; reactions were mixed an incubated at 37C for 2 hours.
