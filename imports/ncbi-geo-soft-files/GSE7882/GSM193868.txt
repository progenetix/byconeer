In addition, LCIS and co-existing areas of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), proliferative disease without atypia (PDWA) and benign epithelium were sampled from a proportion of cases. For in situ lesions care was taken to capture pure intraduct cell populations. Benign epithelium samples were lobular tissue collected with intralobular stroma. !Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = !Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = DNA was extracted from laser microdissected material using the QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) and quantitated using the PicoGreen dsDNA Quantitation Reagent (Molecular Probes) both according to the manufacturers instructions.
