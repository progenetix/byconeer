Five of the (HNSCC) cell lines (Ca9-22, H1, HSC2, HSC3, and D562) were maintained in DMEM (Dulbeccoâs modified Eagle medium) /F12 (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). These cells were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37Â°C.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Chromosomal DNA was isolated from ESCC and HNSCC cell lines using FlexiGene(QIAGEN) according manufacturer's protocol.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = The samples were labeled using the Agilent Geomic DNA Labeling Kit PLUS (Agilent p/n 5188-5309) according to manufacturer's instructions.
