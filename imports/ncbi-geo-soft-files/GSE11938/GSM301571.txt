Five of the (HNSCC) cell lines (Ca9-22, H1, HSC2, HSC3, and D562) were maintained in DMEM (Dulbeccoâs modified Eagle medium) /F12 (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). These cells were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37Â°C.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Chromosomal DNA was isolated from ESCC and HNSCC cell lines using FlexiGene(QIAGEN) according manufacturer's protocol.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = The samples were labeled using the Agilent Geomic DNA Labeling Kit PLUS (Agilent p/n 5188-5309) according to manufacturer's instructions. Genomic DNA was fragmented using restriction exzymes. Random hexamers were used to prime an Exo-Klenow fragment DNA polymerase reaction incorporating CyDye labeled dUTP.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = TE1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line!Sample_growth_protocol_ch2 = Five of the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell lines (TE1, TE2, TE3, YES1, and YES2) were maintained in RPMI1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT).
