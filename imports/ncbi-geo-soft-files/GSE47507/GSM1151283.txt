DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations 450, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = Image data were analysed with Genotyping Console 4.0 to obtain the CEL data files, which were also exported to the Nexus Biodiscovery Edition for data analysis and visualization. Quality controls assessed by Genotyping Console included Contrast Quality Control (CQC>0.4) produced by Birdseed and Median of the Absolute values of all Pairwise Differences (MAPD<0.35). Samples were analysed individually with the Nexus Biodiscovery Edition using the SNP-FASST2 segmentation algorithm and using segment reporting tool filters: minimum of 100 Kb minimum genomic size of a segment, as well as by visual inspection.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Itziar,,Salaverria!Sample_contact_email = isalaver@clinic.cat!Sample_contact_institute = Hospital ClÃ­nic!Sample_contact_address = Rossello 153!Sample_contact_city = Barcelona!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 08036!Sample_contact_country = Spain!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1151nnn/GSM1151283/suppl/GSM1151283_Case1_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1151nnn/GSM1151283/suppl/GSM1151283_Case1_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE47507!Sample_series_id = GSE47508!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.252768	1.312749	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.124829	1.312656	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.150704	1.312637	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.673851	1.311246	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.282831	1.311225	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.256650	1.299111	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.572605	1.284076	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.498076	1.284008	nan	nanCN_502614	0.000000	1	76175	-1.090237	1.283655	nan	nanCN_502616	0.000000	1	76192	-2.540685	1.283637	nan	nanCN_502843	4.000000	1	88453	0.496902	1.271101	nan	nanCN_466171	4.000000	1	218557	1.117464	5.331398	nan	nanCN_468414	4.000000	1	218926	0.813736	5.330713	nan	nanCN_468412	4.000000	1	219009	1.298046	5.330559	nan	nanCN_468413	4.000000	1	219024	0.639279	5.330531	nan	nanCN_470565	4.000000	1	219470	0.730098	5.329703	nan	nanCN_468424	4.000000	1	225521	0.489590	5.318444	nan	nanCN_468425	4.000000	1	225579	0.339934	5.318336	nan	nanCN_460512	4.000000	1	346294	0.231550	3.079476	nan	nanCN_460513	4.000000	1	346393	0.441132	3.079477	nan	nan!sample_table_end
