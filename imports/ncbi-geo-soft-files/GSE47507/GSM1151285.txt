DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations 450, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = Image data were analysed with Genotyping Console 4.0 to obtain the CEL data files, which were also exported to the Nexus Biodiscovery Edition for data analysis and visualization. Quality controls assessed by Genotyping Console included Contrast Quality Control (CQC>0.4) produced by Birdseed and Median of the Absolute values of all Pairwise Differences (MAPD<0.35). Samples were analysed individually with the Nexus Biodiscovery Edition using the SNP-FASST2 segmentation algorithm and using segment reporting tool filters: minimum of 100 Kb minimum genomic size of a segment, as well as by visual inspection.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Itziar,,Salaverria!Sample_contact_email = isalaver@clinic.cat!Sample_contact_institute = Hospital ClÃ­nic!Sample_contact_address = Rossello 153!Sample_contact_city = Barcelona!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 08036!Sample_contact_country = Spain!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1151nnn/GSM1151285/suppl/GSM1151285_Case3_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1151nnn/GSM1151285/suppl/GSM1151285_Case3_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE47507!Sample_series_id = GSE47508!Sample_data_row_count = 1813502#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	1.000000	1	51586	-0.416591	1.532902	nan	nanCN_473964	1.000000	1	51659	-0.554189	1.533051	nan	nanCN_473965	1.000000	1	51674	-0.324550	1.533081	nan	nanCN_473981	1.000000	1	52771	-0.734435	1.535313	nan	nanCN_473982	1.000000	1	52788	-0.240658	1.535348	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.329923	1.555753	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.424415	1.584095	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.361666	1.584231	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.066418	1.584948	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.722536	1.584986	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.442464	1.612444	nan	nanCN_466171	4.000000	1	218557	1.303939	4.230953	nan	nanCN_468414	4.000000	1	218926	0.500595	4.230014	nan	nanCN_468412	4.000000	1	219009	0.984394	4.229803	nan	nanCN_468413	4.000000	1	219024	0.936567	4.229764	nan	nanCN_470565	4.000000	1	219470	0.439524	4.228630	nan	nanCN_468424	4.000000	1	225521	0.196106	4.213208	nan	nanCN_468425	4.000000	1	225579	-0.246063	4.213060	nan	nanCN_460512	4.000000	1	346294	0.479071	5.140095	nan	nanCN_460513	4.000000	1	346393	1.009950	5.140098	nan	nan!sample_table_end
