DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations 450, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = Image data were analysed with Genotyping Console 4.0 to obtain the CEL data files, which were also exported to the Nexus Biodiscovery Edition for data analysis and visualization. Quality controls assessed by Genotyping Console included Contrast Quality Control (CQC>0.4) produced by Birdseed and Median of the Absolute values of all Pairwise Differences (MAPD<0.35). Samples were analysed individually with the Nexus Biodiscovery Edition using the SNP-FASST2 segmentation algorithm and using segment reporting tool filters: minimum of 100 Kb minimum genomic size of a segment, as well as by visual inspection.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Itziar,,Salaverria!Sample_contact_email = isalaver@clinic.cat!Sample_contact_institute = Hospital ClÃ­nic!Sample_contact_address = Rossello 153!Sample_contact_city = Barcelona!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 08036!Sample_contact_country = Spain!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1151nnn/GSM1151288/suppl/GSM1151288_HT_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1151nnn/GSM1151288/suppl/GSM1151288_HT_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE47507!Sample_series_id = GSE47508!Sample_data_row_count = 1813281#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	1.000000	1	61723	-0.196359	1.136172	nan	nanCN_473964	1.000000	1	61796	-0.487357	1.136107	nan	nanCN_473965	1.000000	1	61811	-0.688818	1.136093	nan	nanCN_473981	1.000000	1	62908	-0.051393	1.135109	nan	nanCN_473982	1.000000	1	62925	-0.296991	1.135094	nan	nanCN_497981	1.000000	1	72764	0.073445	1.126376	nan	nanCN_502615	1.000000	1	85924	-0.141317	1.115109	nan	nanCN_502613	1.000000	1	85986	-0.113900	1.115057	nan	nanCN_502614	1.000000	1	86312	-0.769042	1.114785	nan	nanCN_502616	0.000000	1	86329	-2.327723	1.114771	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	98590	-0.059291	1.104838	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	228694	0.315029	3.408577	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	229063	0.736709	3.408235	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	229146	0.634587	3.408158	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	229161	0.468873	3.408144	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	229607	0.580500	3.407731	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	235658	-0.120843	3.402108	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	235716	0.371990	3.402054	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	356431	0.247403	3.755426	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	356530	0.763052	3.755428	nan	nan!sample_table_end
