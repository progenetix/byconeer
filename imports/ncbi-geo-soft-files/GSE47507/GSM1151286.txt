DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations 450, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = Image data were analysed with Genotyping Console 4.0 to obtain the CEL data files, which were also exported to the Nexus Biodiscovery Edition for data analysis and visualization. Quality controls assessed by Genotyping Console included Contrast Quality Control (CQC>0.4) produced by Birdseed and Median of the Absolute values of all Pairwise Differences (MAPD<0.35). Samples were analysed individually with the Nexus Biodiscovery Edition using the SNP-FASST2 segmentation algorithm and using segment reporting tool filters: minimum of 100 Kb minimum genomic size of a segment, as well as by visual inspection.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Itziar,,Salaverria!Sample_contact_email = isalaver@clinic.cat!Sample_contact_institute = Hospital ClÃ­nic!Sample_contact_address = Rossello 153!Sample_contact_city = Barcelona!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 08036!Sample_contact_country = Spain!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1151nnn/GSM1151286/suppl/GSM1151286_Case8_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1151nnn/GSM1151286/suppl/GSM1151286_Case8_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE47507!Sample_series_id = GSE47508!Sample_data_row_count = 1813281#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	1.000000	1	61723	-0.778497	0.824710	nan	nanCN_473964	1.000000	1	61796	-0.344440	0.824629	nan	nanCN_473965	1.000000	1	61811	-0.386869	0.824612	nan	nanCN_473981	1.000000	1	62908	-0.483879	0.823400	nan	nanCN_473982	1.000000	1	62925	-0.427914	0.823382	nan	nanCN_497981	1.000000	1	72764	-0.358267	0.812687	nan	nanCN_502615	1.000000	1	85924	-0.841107	0.798962	nan	nanCN_502613	1.000000	1	85986	-1.363978	0.798899	nan	nanCN_502614	1.000000	1	86312	-1.118430	0.798569	nan	nanCN_502616	1.000000	1	86329	-1.535470	0.798552	nan	nanCN_502843	1.000000	1	98590	-0.295341	0.786518	nan	nanCN_466171	1.000000	1	228694	-0.641419	1.384508	nan	nanCN_468414	1.000000	1	229063	-0.766556	1.384522	nan	nanCN_468412	1.000000	1	229146	0.101402	1.384525	nan	nanCN_468413	1.000000	1	229161	-0.525370	1.384525	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	229607	0.379146	1.384542	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	235658	-0.438906	1.384760	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	235716	-0.172912	1.384762	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	356431	0.754511	3.771954	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	356530	0.262986	3.771951	nan	nan!sample_table_end
