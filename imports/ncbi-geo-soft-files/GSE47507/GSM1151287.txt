DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations 450, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = Image data were analysed with Genotyping Console 4.0 to obtain the CEL data files, which were also exported to the Nexus Biodiscovery Edition for data analysis and visualization. Quality controls assessed by Genotyping Console included Contrast Quality Control (CQC>0.4) produced by Birdseed and Median of the Absolute values of all Pairwise Differences (MAPD<0.35). Samples were analysed individually with the Nexus Biodiscovery Edition using the SNP-FASST2 segmentation algorithm and using segment reporting tool filters: minimum of 100 Kb minimum genomic size of a segment, as well as by visual inspection.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Itziar,,Salaverria!Sample_contact_email = isalaver@clinic.cat!Sample_contact_institute = Hospital ClÃ­nic!Sample_contact_address = Rossello 153!Sample_contact_city = Barcelona!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 08036!Sample_contact_country = Spain!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1151nnn/GSM1151287/suppl/GSM1151287_SUDHL5_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1151nnn/GSM1151287/suppl/GSM1151287_SUDHL5_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE47507!Sample_series_id = GSE47508!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	3.000000	1	51586	0.948827	3.073074	nan	nanCN_473964	3.000000	1	51659	0.441489	3.072768	nan	nanCN_473965	3.000000	1	51674	0.522323	3.072706	nan	nanCN_473981	3.000000	1	52771	0.578158	3.068115	nan	nanCN_473982	3.000000	1	52788	0.386535	3.068043	nan	nanCN_497981	3.000000	1	62627	0.014353	3.026843	nan	nanCN_502615	3.000000	1	75787	0.303408	2.971852	nan	nanCN_502613	3.000000	1	75849	0.171714	2.971593	nan	nanCN_502614	3.000000	1	76175	0.205162	2.970235	nan	nanCN_502616	3.000000	1	76192	0.167507	2.970165	nan	nanCN_502843	3.000000	1	88453	-0.131682	2.919341	nan	nanCN_466171	3.000000	1	218557	0.185948	3.129312	nan	nanCN_468414	3.000000	1	218926	0.321603	3.129392	nan	nanCN_468412	3.000000	1	219009	0.380245	3.129410	nan	nanCN_468413	3.000000	1	219024	0.010142	3.129413	nan	nanCN_470565	3.000000	1	219470	0.790080	3.129510	nan	nanCN_468424	3.000000	1	225521	0.544154	3.130820	nan	nanCN_468425	3.000000	1	225579	0.281732	3.130833	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.573304	1.739988	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.349952	1.739990	nan	nan!sample_table_end
