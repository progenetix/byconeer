DNA pellet was dissolved in hybridisation mixture. Sample was hybridized for 20 hours followed post-hybridisation washes and drying of slides by using an automated hybridisation station (Tecan Benelux BVBA, Giesen, The Netherlands).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Genepix 4100A scanner.!Sample_scan_protocol = Images were quantified using Genepix Pro 4.1 software.!Sample_description = Patient 18!Sample_data_processing = Within this software, spots in which the reference DNA intensity was either below five times the average of the background or presented more than 3% saturated pixels were excluded from further analyses. The test/reference ratios were normalized for the median of the ratios of all features. The triplicates of the features were averaged in a homemade routine developed in Microsoft Excel 2000, and spots outside the 20% confidence interval of the average of the replicate were excluded. Only those targets presenting at least two spots within 20% confidence interval of their average were used. Unbalances of the targets were determined based on log2 ratios of the average of their replicates, and we considered sequences as amplified or deleted when outside the Â±0.3 range.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8634!Sample_contact_name = Marloes,,van Kester!Sample_contact_email = m.s.van_kester@lumc.nl!Sample_contact_department = Dermatology!Sample_contact_institute = Leiden University Medical Center !Sample_contact_address = Einthovenweg 20!Sample_contact_city = Leiden!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 2333 ZC!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM411nnn/GSM411168/suppl/GSM411168.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16384!Sample_data_row_count = 3483#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio representing test/reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEGS-232-B23	0.16424005GS-62-L8	-0.000549703RP11-465B22	0.131244533RP4-785P20	0.013582242RP1-37J18	-0.004358599RP11-49J3	0.085782659RP3-438L4	-0.015687712RP11-338N10	0.047980029RP11-484P7	0.033339945RP3-510D11	0.05467479RP4-575L21	0.010876004RP4-635E18	-0.018615678RP4-539L13	0.030872757RP11-196P5	0.027480736RP4-636F13	-0.002788895RP11-285P3	0.021167334RP4-560M15	0.015203551RP11-45I3	0.009313044RP1-37C10	0.033871423RP11-174G17	0.044327576!sample_table_end
