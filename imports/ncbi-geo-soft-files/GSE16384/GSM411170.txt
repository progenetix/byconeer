DNA pellet was dissolved in hybridisation mixture. Sample was hybridized for 20 hours followed post-hybridisation washes and drying of slides by using an automated hybridisation station (Tecan Benelux BVBA, Giesen, The Netherlands).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Genepix 4100A scanner.!Sample_scan_protocol = Images were quantified using Genepix Pro 4.1 software.!Sample_description = Patient 20!Sample_data_processing = Within this software, spots in which the reference DNA intensity was either below five times the average of the background or presented more than 3% saturated pixels were excluded from further analyses. The test/reference ratios were normalized for the median of the ratios of all features. The triplicates of the features were averaged in a homemade routine developed in Microsoft Excel 2000, and spots outside the 20% confidence interval of the average of the replicate were excluded. Only those targets presenting at least two spots within 20% confidence interval of their average were used. Unbalances of the targets were determined based on log2 ratios of the average of their replicates, and we considered sequences as amplified or deleted when outside the Â±0.3 range.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8634!Sample_contact_name = Marloes,,van Kester!Sample_contact_email = m.s.van_kester@lumc.nl!Sample_contact_department = Dermatology!Sample_contact_institute = Leiden University Medical Center !Sample_contact_address = Einthovenweg 20!Sample_contact_city = Leiden!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 2333 ZC!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM411nnn/GSM411170/suppl/GSM411170.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16384!Sample_data_row_count = 3483#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio representing test/reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEGS-232-B23	0.030413053GS-62-L8	0.116065974RP11-465B22	0.066418082RP4-785P20	-0.105580494RP1-37J18	-0.061710795RP11-49J3	0.001422075RP3-438L4	-0.053728773RP11-338N10	0.010795972RP11-484P7	0.012314609RP3-510D11	-0.01535539RP4-575L21	-0.002347755RP4-635E18	0.016082669RP4-539L13	-0.031506435RP11-196P5	-0.051082406RP4-636F13	-0.017696288RP11-285P3	0.068789725RP4-560M15	-0.03322142RP11-45I3	-0.203188977RP1-37C10	-0.024949123RP11-174G17	0.010866921!sample_table_end
