DNA pellet was dissolved in hybridisation mixture. Sample was hybridized for 20 hours followed post-hybridisation washes and drying of slides by using an automated hybridisation station (Tecan Benelux BVBA, Giesen, The Netherlands).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Genepix 4100A scanner.!Sample_scan_protocol = Images were quantified using Genepix Pro 4.1 software.!Sample_description = Patient 9!Sample_data_processing = Within this software, spots in which the reference DNA intensity was either below five times the average of the background or presented more than 3% saturated pixels were excluded from further analyses. The test/reference ratios were normalized for the median of the ratios of all features. The triplicates of the features were averaged in a homemade routine developed in Microsoft Excel 2000, and spots outside the 20% confidence interval of the average of the replicate were excluded. Only those targets presenting at least two spots within 20% confidence interval of their average were used. Unbalances of the targets were determined based on log2 ratios of the average of their replicates, and we considered sequences as amplified or deleted when outside the Â±0.3 range.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8634!Sample_contact_name = Marloes,,van Kester!Sample_contact_email = m.s.van_kester@lumc.nl!Sample_contact_department = Dermatology!Sample_contact_institute = Leiden University Medical Center !Sample_contact_address = Einthovenweg 20!Sample_contact_city = Leiden!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 2333 ZC!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM411nnn/GSM411159/suppl/GSM411159.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16384!Sample_data_row_count = 3483#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio representing test/reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEGS-232-B23	-0.086828062GS-62-L8	-0.086828062RP11-465B22	-0.086828062RP4-785P20	-0.086828062RP1-37J18	-0.084175139RP11-49J3	-0.084175139RP3-438L4	-0.522293768RP11-338N10	-0.522293768RP11-484P7	-0.084175139RP3-510D11	-0.449007349RP4-575L21	-0.348895142RP4-635E18	0.038339101RP4-539L13	-0.005101731RP11-196P5	0.074293782RP4-636F13	0.024570174RP11-285P3	-0.449007349RP4-560M15	-0.023286853RP11-45I3	-0.348895142RP1-37C10	-0.014255996RP11-174G17	0.038339101!sample_table_end
