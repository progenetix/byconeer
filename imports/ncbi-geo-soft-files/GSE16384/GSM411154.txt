DNA pellet was dissolved in hybridisation mixture. Sample was hybridized for 20 hours followed post-hybridisation washes and drying of slides by using an automated hybridisation station (Tecan Benelux BVBA, Giesen, The Netherlands).!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Genepix 4100A scanner.!Sample_scan_protocol = Images were quantified using Genepix Pro 4.1 software.!Sample_description = Patient 4!Sample_data_processing = Within this software, spots in which the reference DNA intensity was either below five times the average of the background or presented more than 3% saturated pixels were excluded from further analyses. The test/reference ratios were normalized for the median of the ratios of all features. The triplicates of the features were averaged in a homemade routine developed in Microsoft Excel 2000, and spots outside the 20% confidence interval of the average of the replicate were excluded. Only those targets presenting at least two spots within 20% confidence interval of their average were used. Unbalances of the targets were determined based on log2 ratios of the average of their replicates, and we considered sequences as amplified or deleted when outside the Â±0.3 range.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8634!Sample_contact_name = Marloes,,van Kester!Sample_contact_email = m.s.van_kester@lumc.nl!Sample_contact_department = Dermatology!Sample_contact_institute = Leiden University Medical Center !Sample_contact_address = Einthovenweg 20!Sample_contact_city = Leiden!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 2333 ZC!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM411nnn/GSM411154/suppl/GSM411154.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16384!Sample_data_row_count = 3483#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio representing test/reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEGS-232-B23	0.146154409GS-62-L8	0.091756243RP11-465B22	RP4-785P20	-0.070668947RP1-37J18	-0.017585366RP11-49J3	-0.022751233RP3-438L4	-0.044531928RP11-338N10	0.012741275RP11-484P7	-0.032002824RP3-510D11	-0.002695116RP4-575L21	-0.047849468RP4-635E18	0.001888345RP4-539L13	0.030781893RP11-196P5	0.015475181RP4-636F13	-0.044848567RP11-285P3	-0.144471822RP4-560M15	-0.020650509RP11-45I3	-0.086711633RP1-37C10	0.008478154RP11-174G17	-0.039801008!sample_table_end
