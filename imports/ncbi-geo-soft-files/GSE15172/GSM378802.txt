All of the digested DNAs were subjected to labeling reactions using Agilentâs Genomic DNA Labeling Kit PLUS per manufacturerâs instructions. For each array-CGH experiment, we used DNA isolated from NPC cell line as experimental genome (cyanine 5 UTP-labeled) and the commercial healthy Caucasian male genome (Promega) as reference (cyanine 3 UTP-labeled).!Sample_source_name_ch2 = peripheral lymphocytes!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = disease state: normal male reference!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Both cell lines were without any treatment before extraction of genomic DNA.!Sample_growth_protocol_ch2 = The TW01 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).

The ScanControl Software (Agilent Technologies) was used for image acquisition. In brief, the arrays were imaged at a resolution of 5 Î¼m. Excitation of Cy3 and Cy5 was performed at a wavelength of 532 and 635 nm, respectively. A laser power of 100% was used. Each array was subjected to a series of scans. The signals were digitized into 16 bit/pixel, yielding a maximum detection range from 1 to 65536; i.e., almost five orders of magnitude.!Sample_description = Biological replicate 2 of 2. genomic DNA of NPC cell lines vs. pool of normal male genome .!Sample_data_processing = After image acquisition, data extraction, normalization and transformation were carried out by using Agilent Feature Extraction Software, version 8.1.1 (Agilent Technologies), procedures listed as follow:  (1) Place Grid, find and measure spots  -define what is the array format of the image to be processed.  (2) Flag outliers  a. Compute population outliers- flag features and local backgrounds as population outliers if the minimum number of replicates is met and the mean signals varies significantly from the distribution.  b. Compute NonUniform outliers- flag features and local backgrounds as NonUniform if the pixel distribution is outside the boundary defined by the three-parameter noise model.  (3)   Compute Background, bias and error              Background subtractionâ signal correction â choose error model   (4) Dye normalization â   a. Use rank consistent probes.  b. Normalization correction methods: Linear method  (5) Compute ratios- the log ratio values are capped to 4 with appropriate signs in positive and negative directions.  Subsequent data analysis was performed with the other custom analytical software, CGH Analytics (version 3.5.14, Agilent Technologies). The Linear smoothing algorithm is used in the Moving Average approach to smooth the data sets with window size of 5 Mb.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Chia,Huei,Lee!Sample_contact_email = chlee124@nhri.edu.tw!Sample_contact_department = National Institute of Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Taiwan National Health Research Institute!Sample_contact_address = 35, Keyan Rd.!Sample_contact_city = Zhunan Miaoli County!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 114!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378802/suppl/GSM378802.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15172!Sample_series_id = GSE15191!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	-6.928148382e-0022	-1.226100246e-0013	1.260646052e-0014	8.396494531e-0025	1.094913457e-0026	-2.088215313e-0017	5.075374792e-0018	-2.130202787e-0019	1.462785329e-00110	1.232319779e-00111	2.529681949e-00112	1.423405634e-00113	3.802592783e-00214	-1.233330904e-00115	3.451277502e-00116	-2.267210321e-00117	2.532773723e-00218	-9.770039973e-00119	-2.064009014e-00120	-4.864537566e-002!sample_table_end
