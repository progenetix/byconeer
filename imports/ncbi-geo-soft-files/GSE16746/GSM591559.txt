If B-CLL cells were less than 90%, T cells, NK cells and monocytes were removed by negative selection using CD3, CD56, CD16, and CD14 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment (Becton Dickinson) followed by magnetic beads (Goat Anti-Mouse IgG Dynabeads, Dynal Biotech ASA, Oslo, Norway).!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA extraction was performed using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Biotinylated DNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol starting from 250 nanograms of genomic DNA.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Following fragmentation, 90 micrograms of biotin-labeled DNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 49Â°C on GeneChip Human Mapping 250K NspI Arrays. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.!Sample_scan_protocol = Human Mapping 250K NspI arrays were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix).!Sample_description = Genome-wide profiling data from human B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient AS0012!Sample_data_processing = Images were acquired using Affymetrix GeneChip Operating System (GCOS 1.4). The raw data for individual SNPs were extracted from CEL files and converted into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares using the Hidden Markov Model algorithm with a genomic smoothing window set to 0. After the pre-processing, piecewise constant estimates of the underlying local DNA copy number (CN) variation was calculated using the DNAcopy Bioconductor package, which looks for optimal breakpoints using circular binary segmentation (CBS), (Olshen et al., Biostatistics 2004) and the median of the estimated profiles was scaled back to a nominal multiplicity of two. After scaling, a k-means clustering algorithm was used on the cumulative profile of all the data to determine the thresholds for inferring discrete CN values. Inferred CN higher than 2.1 and 2.5 corresponded to gain and amplification whereas CN below 1.9 and 1.34 to loss and biallelic deletion, respectively.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The pre-processed data generated by GTYPE/CNAT are available in 'GSE16746_CNAT_signals.txt', which is linked to the Series GSE16746 record as a supplementary file.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Luca,,Agnelli!Sample_contact_email = luca.agnelli@unimi.it, katiatodoerti@gmail.com!Sample_contact_phone = +390255033328!Sample_contact_department = Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology - Hematology 1!Sample_contact_institute = University of Milan - Fondazione IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico!Sample_contact_address = Francesco Sforza, 35!Sample_contact_city = MILAN!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20122!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM591nnn/GSM591559/suppl/GSM591559.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16746!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = Inferred copy number calculated using  circular binary segmentation (CBS) method!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1886933	1.999168396SNP_A-1902458	1.999168396SNP_A-2131660	1.999168396SNP_A-4221087	1.999168396SNP_A-1884606	1.999168396SNP_A-2235839	1.999168396SNP_A-2218153	1.999168396SNP_A-1919019	1.999168396SNP_A-1815933	1.999168396SNP_A-2115098	1.999168396SNP_A-2264565	1.999168396SNP_A-1788728	1.999168396SNP_A-4218776	1.999168396SNP_A-2082194	1.999168396SNP_A-2135694	1.999168396SNP_A-4220764	1.999168396SNP_A-1796345	1.999168396SNP_A-1789472	1.999168396SNP_A-1934233	1.999168396SNP_A-4207031	1.999168396!sample_table_end
