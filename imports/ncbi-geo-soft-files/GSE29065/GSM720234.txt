Quantified intensities for tumor sample were stored as channel 1 (ch1) whereas quantified intensities for reference sample were stored as channel 2 (ch2). Median spot pixel values were used to calculate background corrected intensities (Int1 and Int2). Spots were removed and regarded as missing values if either: (1) flagged during image-analysis, (2) background corrected intensity value >64999 signal units, or (3) background corrected intensity value <0 signal units. For spots, log ratio (M) was calculated as log2(Int1/Int2) and average intensity (A) was calculated as log10(Int1*Int2)/2. Normalization was performed by applying popLowess (PMID: 17953745). Spots from dye-swap hybridization were merged using geometric mean of ratios after normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM720nnn/GSM720234/suppl/GSM720234_LU136_cy3_Ref_cy5.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM720nnn/GSM720234/suppl/GSM720234_LU136_cy5_Ref_cy3.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29065!Sample_series_id = GSE29066!Sample_data_row_count = 31673#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference male DNA).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	-0.0459496921614	0.23727704525469	0.02885886428383	-0.0961102748727	-0.183537646520	-0.32176204110890	-0.2428606914569	-0.20283058427130	-0.56562509111653	-0.2551396351416	-0.19121584919111	0.29410870119756	-0.06253854325591	0.02532831533609	0.34316004632861	0.10922225632882	-1.48121911724132	-0.01681182628512	-0.09973031322670	0.177755171!sample_table_end
