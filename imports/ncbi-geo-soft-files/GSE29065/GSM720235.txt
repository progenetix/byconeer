Quantified intensities for tumor sample were stored as channel 1 (ch1) whereas quantified intensities for reference sample were stored as channel 2 (ch2). Median spot pixel values were used to calculate background corrected intensities (Int1 and Int2). Spots were removed and regarded as missing values if either: (1) flagged during image-analysis, (2) background corrected intensity value >64999 signal units, or (3) background corrected intensity value <0 signal units. For spots, log ratio (M) was calculated as log2(Int1/Int2) and average intensity (A) was calculated as log10(Int1*Int2)/2. Normalization was performed by applying popLowess (PMID: 17953745). Spots from dye-swap hybridization were merged using geometric mean of ratios after normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM720nnn/GSM720235/suppl/GSM720235_LU137.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29065!Sample_series_id = GSE29066!Sample_data_row_count = 31673#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference male DNA).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	0.19836155421614	0.11120208125469	0.54088145328383	0.5554748418727	0.2760731996520	0.14402004410890	0.24393437714569	0.14317009527130	0.18300824211653	0.1585979761416	0.40038425419111	0.35591211419756	-0.10811910625591	0.14688160533609	0.057445532861	0.12320740132882	0.49625074424132	0.0586396928512	0.26236918822670	0.041803334!sample_table_end
