Quantified intensities for tumor sample were stored as channel 1 (ch1) whereas quantified intensities for reference sample were stored as channel 2 (ch2). Median spot pixel values were used to calculate background corrected intensities (Int1 and Int2). Spots were removed and regarded as missing values if either: (1) flagged during image-analysis, (2) background corrected intensity value >64999 signal units, or (3) background corrected intensity value <0 signal units. For spots, log ratio (M) was calculated as log2(Int1/Int2) and average intensity (A) was calculated as log10(Int1*Int2)/2. Normalization was performed by applying popLowess (PMID: 17953745). Spots from dye-swap hybridization were merged using geometric mean of ratios after normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM720nnn/GSM720286/suppl/GSM720286_LU460.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29065!Sample_series_id = GSE29066!Sample_data_row_count = 31673#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference male DNA).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	0.1768949921614	0.01740622425469	0.08027976328383	0.0709727888727	-0.0189582616520	-0.02214155410890	-0.04785421214569	-0.12055128227130	0.00416045211653	-0.0578383451416	0.18603141519111	0.20163948519756	-0.10737217325591	0.09286456133609	-0.12032156732861	0.10923144232882	0.45902543624132	-0.18364492828512	0.12977405122670	-0.164413396!sample_table_end
