Quantified intensities for tumor sample were stored as channel 1 (ch1) whereas quantified intensities for reference sample were stored as channel 2 (ch2). Median spot pixel values were used to calculate background corrected intensities (Int1 and Int2). Spots were removed and regarded as missing values if either: (1) flagged during image-analysis, (2) background corrected intensity value >64999 signal units, or (3) background corrected intensity value <0 signal units. For spots, log ratio (M) was calculated as log2(Int1/Int2) and average intensity (A) was calculated as log10(Int1*Int2)/2. Normalization was performed by applying popLowess (PMID: 17953745). Spots from dye-swap hybridization were merged using geometric mean of ratios after normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM720nnn/GSM720269/suppl/GSM720269_LU375.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29065!Sample_series_id = GSE29066!Sample_data_row_count = 31673#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference male DNA).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	0.26870896621614	0.26216992925469	0.75537361128383	0.6036732098727	0.0434600756520	0.1850259810890	0.04597729814569	0.01297929227130	-0.11413587611653	-0.0285559271416	-0.04351861519111	0.14229973319756	-0.30127459325591	-0.61502475333609	-0.18913498432861	-0.31514392432882	0.17399910824132	-0.39548587328512	-0.42718897222670	-0.382985888!sample_table_end
