Quantified intensities for tumor sample were stored as channel 1 (ch1) whereas quantified intensities for reference sample were stored as channel 2 (ch2). Median spot pixel values were used to calculate background corrected intensities (Int1 and Int2). Spots were removed and regarded as missing values if either: (1) flagged during image-analysis, (2) background corrected intensity value >64999 signal units, or (3) background corrected intensity value <0 signal units. For spots, log ratio (M) was calculated as log2(Int1/Int2) and average intensity (A) was calculated as log10(Int1*Int2)/2. Normalization was performed by applying popLowess (PMID: 17953745). Spots from dye-swap hybridization were merged using geometric mean of ratios after normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM720nnn/GSM720300/suppl/GSM720300_LU740.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29065!Sample_series_id = GSE29066!Sample_data_row_count = 31673#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference male DNA).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	0.10995555921614	-0.33589391925469	-0.60767953528383	0.0110463058727	0.0043569156520	-0.11263567610890	-0.01437607614569	-0.07353099527130	-0.16002572311653	0.1126226711416	0.11683612619111	0.46182794719756	0.16986457925591	-0.01506858933609	0.18901374832861	0.17330156232882	0.25355366924132	0.3172520328512	-0.21638368722670	0.306869458!sample_table_end
