CEL file signal extraction, quantile normalization, median polishing, and signal intensity generation was performed using the Affymetrix Power Tools software and the GenomeWideSNP_6.cdf annotation file. Calculation of total signal intensity values (log R ratio) per marker and GC-adjustment to account for genomic waves in signal intensities were performed according to the PennCNV protocol adapted for Affymetrix genotyping arrays (PennCNV-Affy), using the PennCNV-Affy affygw6.hg18.pfb annotation file. As an integrated part of the PennCNV-Affy pipeline, HapMap samples were used as reference for normalization (using the hapmap.quant-norm.normalization-target.txt file) and log R ratio calculation (using the hapmap.genocluster file).!Sample_data_processing = Total signal intensity value (log R ratio) per marker and sample. Genomic positions are given according to the NCBI 36 (hg18) human genome assembly.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Anita,,Sveen!Sample_contact_email = anita.sveen@rr-research.no!Sample_contact_department = Department of Molecular Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital!Sample_contact_address = P.O.Box 4953, Nydalen!Sample_contact_city = Oslo!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = NO-0424!Sample_contact_country = Norway!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1550nnn/GSM1550736/suppl/GSM1550736_t85-7_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE63490!Sample_data_row_count = 1851567
