Probe sequences were re-mapped to the hg18 build of the human genome and merged. Probe-level data was subsequently normalized for local GC content with a two-stage LOESS fit. Probe-level data is the log2 ratio of cell-line-to-normal.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Martin,L,Miller!Sample_contact_email = martin.miller@cruk.cam.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Martin Miller!Sample_contact_department = Cancer research UK, Cambridge Institute!Sample_contact_institute = University of Cambridge!Sample_contact_address = Robinson Way!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB2 0RE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1228nnn/GSM1228009/suppl/GSM1228009_PD_LPS141_slide501_S01_CGH-v4_10_27Aug08.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE50750!Sample_series_id = GSE50751!Sample_data_row_count = 235829
