Cells not grown past 80% confluencey for attached cells, or 0.5 x 10^6 cells for suspended. Trypsinize (for attached cells) cells with 5 ml trypsin-EDTA per T162, for 15 min., at 37C. Spin down suspended cells, and resuspend in ~3ml growth media. Count cells. Pass 1x10^6 cells into new T162's w 30 ml media. Repeat growth cycle until desired amount of cells are available. Cells are not grown past passage 20.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was purified from cells using either the QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit, or the Blood & Cell Culture DNA Maxi Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions.  Quality was assessed by optical density 260/280 ratio using a spectrophotometer (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and by 0.8% agarose (SeaKem GTG, FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME) gel electrophoresis in 1x TAE (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin, dinitrophenyl!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Done according to array manufacturer's specifications.
