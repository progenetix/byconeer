Briefly, replication intermediates are prepared from cells that are first pulse-labeled with BrdU and then sorted into early (1st half of S) and late (2nd half of S) stages of S-phase by flow cytometry, followed by anti-BrdU immunoprecipitation of the BrdU-substituted (nascent) replication intermediates that were synthesized either early or late during S-phase. Samples were labeled after unbiased amplification of recovered DNA by whole-genome amplification (WGA; Sigma, GenomePlex).

Briefly, Cy3 and Cy5 labeled DNA samples (34 ug each) were co-hybridized to Nimblegen CGH arrays containing one oligonucleotide probe every 2.5 kb across the human genome.!Sample_scan_protocol = NimbleGen MS200 microarray scanner (Roche NimbleGen, Inc.) and MS200 data collection software were used per NimbleGen's standard protocol (www.nimblegen.com/products/lit/index.html).!Sample_description = submitted as of 5/12/12!Sample_data_processing = NimbleScan software was used to obtain .pair raw data per manufacturer's instructions. Raw early/late data (i.e. from .pair files) from two independent biological replicates in which early and late replicating DNA were differentially labeled were loess-normalized to remove signal intensity-dependent bias, then scaled to a reference data set to have the same median absolute deviation (limma package, R/Bioconductor).The early/late ratios were used to generate a smoothed profile (i.e. processed data) using local polynomial smoothing (loess, 300-kb span) for each chromosome using the loess function in the statistical language R. Processed data sets can be graphically displayed (and are also downloadable) on our web site (http://www.replicationdomain.org).
