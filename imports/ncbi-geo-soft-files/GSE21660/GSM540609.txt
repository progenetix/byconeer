Each sample was then mechanically sheared then filtered through a 30 micron mesh filter prior to sorting. All sorting was done with an Influx Flow Cytometer equiped with a UV laser. DNA was extracted from each sorted fraction using Qiagen DNA micro kits. All phi29 amplifications were done with a 100ng aliquot of either sample or reference genomic DNA using the GenomiPhi kit (G.E Health Care).!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = A 1 microgram aliquot of each sample and reference DNA was digested with DNAse 1 then labeled with a fluorescent nucleotide (Cy5 for tumor and Cy3 for normal reference) using the BioPrime labeling kit (Invitrogen)according to manufacturer's protocol.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Reference pooled 46XX!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: pooled normal (46,XX) reference (Promega)!Sample_growth_protocol_ch2 = Tumor samples from patients with either pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, or prostate carcinoma were flash-frozen and maintaned at -80 degrees C until processed for flow sorting!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 25-100 mg of tumor was thawed then minced in the presence of NST and DAPI.

The data quality was assessed using the QC Report output in F.E. 10.5. All arrays that passed the experimental Q.C. were then visulaized and analyzed using DNA Analytics 4.0.85 and the ADM2 step gram algorithm.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Michael,Thomas,Barrett!Sample_contact_email = barrett.michael@mayo.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 480-301-6736!Sample_contact_department = Research!Sample_contact_institute = Mayo Clinic Arizona!Sample_contact_address = 13208 East Shea Boulevard!Sample_contact_city = Scottsdale!Sample_contact_state = AZ!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 85259!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM540nnn/GSM540609/suppl/GSM540609.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21660!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = log10 normalized ratio Cy5/Cy3 (tumor/ref)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	-2.29E-042	-4.62E-033	0.00E+004	1.67E-015	-1.15E-016	2.09E-037	-2.34E-028	-4.69E-029	1.02E-0110	-2.17E-0111	1.57E-0112	4.54E-0113	8.57E-0214	-3.94E-0215	1.79E-0116	-4.91E-0117	-3.68E-0118	2.99E-0119	-1.18E-0120	-1.42E-01!sample_table_end
