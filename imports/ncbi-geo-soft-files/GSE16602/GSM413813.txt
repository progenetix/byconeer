Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413813/suppl/GSM413813_NN812.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413813/suppl/GSM413813_NN813.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16602!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	6268.735303310692	4946.7882977462559	6383.5452314007589	4395.5402150202935	2.6005649888031876	1.7550001478699011	1.4818032875721263	0.5025	1.41662625058663492	5151.5111728953134	2705.8522889834553	5441.4620576965699	2304.9050283275496	1.9557192116012656	0.81275625152066411	2.4062801214289302	0.8729	1.83136041578809923	4837.5932550932412	3667.808424961132	5160.1581414275424	3175.425056081609	1.7940258339417219	1.0624621226872129	1.688555098231846	0.7128	1.63898607174329034	19287.75096422655	9446.4455006325898	17139.560570080201	8750.8278089972046	5.8266499811375789	2.9039142813262013	2.0064813960268078	0.9306	1.90607151741642515	20543.582614208713	8294.2475132474774	18334.022702226219	7644.0078470613407	6.7785052223326572	2.9201796566802529	2.3212630794225397	1.0444	2.06251810438757626	16050.562888641169	12720.545577681567	14117.124361099897	11851.510870382914	4.8749074270287176	4.201381680437513	1.1603105353953618	0.3407	1.26636624640361877	4278.6355271786724	2388.4974211122658	4655.0438326177764	2022.9388207135423	1.7995256506577633	0.77793942336419342	2.3131950851336569	1.3470	2.5438096810803058	3057.2851248325824	2547.9080562571007	3489.694265731152	2155.1935538293892	1.1736996175362331	0.73412165509219207	1.5987808143172646	0.5815	1.49641061527329039	3488.8720187160602	4212.0603420731804	3911.4210872685089	3690.3458752594352	1.3234537902556156	1.330178005230394	0.99494487583741575	0.3343	1.260796837474832810	18303.510795737518	12772.157687028173	16201.157245353763	11888.907495522089	5.754841890545122	4.4297945469489655	1.2991216250669653	0.2693	1.205259169258933811	14450.703035861228	11161.774773698326	12790.104913572963	10374.976604128855	4.5713991341229185	3.7647397041243478	1.2142669861384732	0.2363	1.177982207795829512	36729.234891456115	14847.766121721688	34034.934299796958	13784.648118652891	12.492242611291148	5.1325652023762496	2.4339179569521221	1.1309	2.190015726351072413	4550.4033466501014	4466.58765629973	4908.8502701410189	3933.8131137398595	1.8761244890113293	1.4816310394755643	1.2662561994350492	0.4346	1.351522670764898414	13427.037377300596	7438.3916051410715	11891.733864250255	6818.1403205773286	3.9977633395314793	2.2839890180498772	1.7503426277175638	0.9415	1.920487059551684115	2925.8975357833478	2534.4150043740074	3357.0197008377122	2146.126223990871	1.2735021198398579	0.85244912697704311	1.4939332794626161	0.5001	1.414281590369510516	4796.3554827335111	4541.6666055431797	5121.3322118792084	4004.7849816907656	1.8029008260272656	1.520387490779316	1.1858166664493797	0.4679	1.383061244464438317	634.59881743870494	865.67675317254873	818.63924859740382	756.03740952918099	0.24257225100424937	0.21946898330000456	1.1052689421386876	0.1071	1.077030121244872118	8460.5496462143292	7012.5999035264285	8118.9625072797953	6410.7639185334256	2.802205297650203	2.2563650976564782	1.2419112937709633	0.3992	1.318786742128726519	2019.9591993227216	2307.5909936250132	2416.8507247549123	1957.7128282067513	0.96568476194240949	0.81407257220596752	1.1862391571866922	0.3001	1.231245685270476520	2587.5069154894791	2443.9452003950914	3016.7560572881061	2073.572444439737	1.3526901418466923	0.97737760622088998	1.3839995240703118	0.5927	1.5080820283712466!sample_table_end
