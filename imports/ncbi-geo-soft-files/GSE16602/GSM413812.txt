Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413812/suppl/GSM413812_NN810.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413812/suppl/GSM413812_NN811.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16602!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	7107.4042391745215	6773.3911449992884	6917.0022036998216	6505.3363972719453	2.4699892255733049	2.2856915880870563	1.0806310170833202	0.1172	1.08465205686055332	1656.2391127379394	1473.2582714958412	1769.2857414635685	1424.7036520873321	0.67709966261409626	0.55453479928410754	1.2210228528276628	0.1288	1.09338729326581133	4225.0033041720344	3891.6002365037971	4247.9610875336175	3779.6626604019898	1.5903419898405842	1.4358961707705877	1.1075605759064819	0.2352	1.17705477570306674	11101.777791188368	8485.9458809838907	10652.788574751021	8103.9069697435625	3.2834572248892191	2.6110198507473639	1.2575382082788	0.4320	1.34914639650802935	9485.0930990461275	7718.011970946317	9102.5218616753627	7391.9870764592233	3.8668551320396798	3.1500944813900187	1.2275362389554045	0.2604	1.19780659108865486	11720.746625613245	8558.480799370991	11254.417604034421	8173.1488790387521	4.2146463639957314	3.1062150135494191	1.3568430857526912	0.4240	1.3416367945428147	3622.2797987254421	2606.6202788288474	3675.4941085952805	2535.5319258405375	1.2334200333767302	0.82342090861407469	1.4979216831556268	0.4787	1.39353407231640148	2876.5252456802386	1683.1792903849848	2961.0303267544482	1633.0433374086101	1.0806896103788617	0.6013083809124643	1.7972302477124189	0.6519	1.57127224858435789	4152.4886441587123	3971.1102611374408	4177.6399645858646	3855.3283087270579	1.6209898723162979	1.4804055980716864	1.0949633495224083	0.1731	1.127443632604668810	11054.954120244352	8329.6747923616404	10610.685541268829	7962.5331288409852	3.3841107897001539	2.6792748436811613	1.2630696688998844	0.1108	1.07984422784482911	17758.635948014122	21224.354339837399	17410.706339987053	19983.143972977105	5.922572240536244	6.8888988967723019	0.85972697949031951	-0.2872	0.8194775015599969912	19010.986782976357	16354.584784678606	18734.082136120785	15439.406045193875	6.4713796339817637	5.4190539913704709	1.1941899165956018	0.4079	1.326748609442134413	6227.4742692934988	6449.7381802457066	6107.7239772057501	6203.8785311848687	2.0551688583929528	2.1495239334017731	0.95610419891464205	0.0247	1.017268360994055214	10909.745048218721	10929.086996809414	10444.79495758245	10378.655480360336	3.1599943423427472	3.1678743160620484	0.99751253587323607	0.0310	1.021693562707941115	4667.2062442397455	4666.2971315542272	4662.3801597833781	4520.7711392504725	1.6040377293943786	1.6025313139774084	1.0009400224531222	0.1345	1.097680953103500316	4503.3413996869831	5293.2202494691774	4508.4531981553982	5123.558616508697	1.5685964465538376	1.7879588330705971	0.87731127671433462	-0.1010	0.9323902142067624917	910.3015115605109	1131.7363250378451	1015.6718875787915	1089.1198808197448	0.4308108270231118	0.4528805615117949	0.95126809060867956	-0.1041	0.930379688485461618	5806.261224196146	5305.3677128603949	5720.2796664899506	5126.3726222471678	1.9608321134314106	1.7662198354622842	1.1101857617391038	0.3045	1.235018310586920619	3373.5556022469141	3592.6066313832575	3436.1895723570783	3488.6756206990763	1.3928461639826075	1.4463384050990129	0.96301540432873767	0.1169	1.08437409619034920	1953.7453911026007	1783.5280666979572	2064.0186628679653	1732.443753852544	0.86497580280239295	0.74781328377709988	1.1566734926578484	0.3707	1.2930225055484545!sample_table_end
