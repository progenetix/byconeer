Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413815/suppl/GSM413815_NN818.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413815/suppl/GSM413815_NN819.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16602!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	7545.8052214579075	5839.8400245565499	7631.0009975570692	5586.1284667805485	2.378829118853131	1.7571096985524903	1.3538307373824263	0.4865	1.40107959697183222	3988.9362133485688	2845.7343132554533	4143.9277432185745	2729.490501201899	1.358587880317415	0.91459664004159502	1.4854503295087851	0.3465	1.27148324479761283	3442.5919298222116	3389.9815828598853	3591.867686839299	3250.6401260429006	1.1361543608236799	1.0440533531258787	1.088214847854329	0.2029	1.15099363073663694	21267.725964829006	14008.87333321913	21150.357722629789	13095.848673468101	5.5033643116360356	3.4580840594579216	1.5914489691435456	0.5302	1.44413366720115755	13996.267003614101	9923.3209383401936	13710.147655827048	9367.4497487562476	4.4370939744903604	3.2263195045484294	1.37528039868184	0.4618	1.37724407130739266	16006.811487295408	11449.495381687453	15779.113186658902	10760.261240787962	5.1475046222078458	3.5974589952920515	1.4308723543324104	0.5709	1.4854432463465357	4326.9215495154958	2792.9923834559704	4480.9287799731255	2678.0078686636421	1.3654670020929478	0.81198383934045426	1.681643077037184	0.8636	1.81954375288751828	3874.6150807252302	3001.2547545317552	4026.0227153692986	2878.9306386387711	1.2205452454265056	0.86199346692482115	1.4159564918523395	0.3732	1.29525954979930899	4327.2157400462311	3897.3190182829953	4479.5155934459035	3731.5317644500287	1.4288466091642036	1.2349127543031817	1.1570425555855983	0.3843	1.305256408069712710	21154.583169668935	16751.879363490953	21022.295867437078	15585.79869342486	5.8369001026870633	4.652406735771657	1.2545979821170872	0.1727	1.127189641902588411	12577.40717024693	15175.151151320128	12310.609189502857	14157.814643448164	3.4782872611883953	3.9968659899896997	0.87025366121853875	-0.0828	0.9442316266586920912	24383.347482161575	22166.88346170793	24331.860507514004	20469.891274854501	6.8751891052931491	5.95949094466331	1.153653754847944	0.4333	1.350341737620506913	5003.1301706263666	4099.8954924248164	5154.3864487637502	3926.2066526268504	1.5555199965459132	1.2030911513311371	1.2929361127997974	0.2932	1.225373869995404214	12311.996741397568	10186.384047005968	12060.135820341415	9606.2239207501625	3.1184732205522883	2.580671511680467	1.2083960343025675	0.3641	1.287039485370452515	4067.5987202505144	3446.5415249908292	4222.7075146593497	3301.2103837399677	1.2705564055289962	1.0154116395908983	1.2512722486034273	0.4438	1.360158224658241116	4758.8703553635169	4597.0466446876108	4909.8826371788327	4398.6118646367204	1.4561801722102552	1.3328652209014256	1.0925186953452284	0.2402	1.181150408349476217	543.17232904090827	587.77317090949123	576.82081177220175	579.27008782945279	0.23071015586900348	0.23556121318177753	0.97940638338863273	-0.1333	0.9117404760023832818	8311.6773785214191	6636.9560544033629	8330.2594360146268	6315.1583089008373	2.6465699835934893	2.0858887860479234	1.2687972634475269	0.5600	1.474277057182147119	2832.6120590814512	2879.8288009056755	2978.1484310179949	2761.3383084391558	0.82295184023428181	0.77011351283898688	1.0686110898126031	0.2498	1.189017449747089620	2599.7374785088073	2764.7987701212355	2741.4401557276956	2652.6533505586062	0.89723922411591839	0.90133554800818294	0.99545527312074078	0.1988	1.1477764648727942!sample_table_end
