Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413814/suppl/GSM413814_NN816.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413814/suppl/GSM413814_NN817.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16602!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	5755.591087642737	6043.2925178472251	5827.3501124003533	5654.3023073682316	2.1753372533340354	2.0832048581279801	1.0442262770493189	0.0400	1.02812993133898492	3302.465192875412	1858.2327843599544	3605.4908675445704	1634.2153054913781	1.3747838952896247	0.62929461446690349	2.1846427153269858	0.8546	1.80821058202522743	3953.1156866952865	4098.418411073304	4214.6871417052953	3719.3024745490507	1.4098161126896547	1.2633412743823786	1.1159424149890809	0.3194	1.2478183227699024	15607.863434157462	10724.604641684886	13589.887931015819	10367.16795584944	4.3326488938091554	3.260207178172267	1.3289489461949227	0.3154	1.24432532848619975	11143.628614529331	9619.8452993583378	10083.597385143834	9274.1426535659884	4.4695788516145747	4.3569174608912418	1.0258580502693955	0.2352	1.17703204475265726	12562.078819196631	11585.804095165726	11155.658628166053	11237.595401437278	4.099222905218153	4.2178472571702583	0.97187561693931757	0.0509	1.03592922338777937	3827.9212547357461	2090.0228323171646	4105.9907739826558	1843.9140826853943	1.5928721019382468	0.72565722404219324	2.1950750976684681	1.2742	2.41869063795847438	2353.7351039663017	2522.8067958146476	2665.0283400356593	2229.9776402629182	0.92427098744547209	0.78830691109578332	1.1724760679323392	0.2122	1.15842040168983019	2892.5230072061427	3952.9376812063961	3211.0739635856526	3578.6381030768266	1.2330602908955757	1.3792608595509677	0.89400078480948908	0.0138	1.009636763191849910	14618.855799125158	13080.83143904747	12842.368318253159	12708.787006701908	4.3398637410695056	4.3514895037627204	0.99732832569556684	0.0345	1.024197327980846111	11583.051310143303	15586.820040805565	10439.437350344067	15091.316773172262	4.3373141825751249	6.09912065693557	0.71113762565804961	-0.3350	0.7927893245685457812	30747.711128624353	15935.756292751694	27047.869294952554	15444.497764652218	10.016545937350958	5.599908767717932	1.7886980579208418	0.8078	1.750491678356703113	4865.1080778200649	5006.7209972720711	5059.3190051698357	4616.5225376286407	1.696768002366758	1.5692836176466756	1.0812373131832347	0.0980	1.070316395864957314	13682.440498812444	9147.9858143655347	11975.758756118663	8814.9774332592551	3.9081647087499731	2.8709312517873937	1.3612881556522172	0.5150	1.428962098784348515	3350.2370269942771	3773.3483102156579	3651.6669228195651	3403.7838348124587	1.2052572051070638	1.177825383601264	1.0232902278111256	0.0902	1.064493063044864816	4017.1757467041284	4100.4214316142043	4284.1781319594165	3723.0823958439637	1.7243202084707709	1.550601504784787	1.112033106604069	0.1854	1.13717088275022217	506.70449351296753	676.63766748329522	619.49132152360119	606.13881175498273	0.26332321225276423	0.27534416515442794	0.95634208229935891	0.1035	1.074339566670268418	6264.8675232266369	6368.2897500859472	6259.1629352465234	5974.9875644397225	2.251523554554697	2.1670167040343911	1.0389968616130079	0.1327	1.096359210494302119	2319.0937540453037	2883.331491970112	2630.7172371032839	2570.2537555509502	1.0450009471166091	1.0579946377366922	0.98771856665750235	0.0964	1.069133254881607520	1572.1527050228251	1698.0727287867844	1845.24574289251	1492.748077118694	0.97677627244181198	0.82032676482658617	1.1907160833016324	0.2907	1.2232648165868789!sample_table_end
