Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413811/suppl/GSM413811_NN806.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413811/suppl/GSM413811_NN807.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16602!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	7330.4164949973756	6635.7813664342884	6961.7274309905088	6375.8867816947877	2.4960136604628977	2.2815093143931242	1.0940186150968361	0.1650	1.12115256610236092	3099.8321154071514	1664.41648566868	3361.2114830086293	1502.823973168604	1.3546438261757359	0.63333780209056634	2.1388962125807609	0.7804	1.71763712713451373	5335.5886877146722	4899.2425221217691	5326.1936350155656	4595.0611859297596	1.8767162101925949	1.7512734695285237	1.0716294415730758	0.3744	1.29633853164903724	19123.696316871061	9480.3037417758369	16434.750752200074	9283.6752995695751	5.1502249879264674	3.0018042500957356	1.7157098061148428	0.7379	1.66770273567016975	18267.481997695613	7413.7397594864697	15768.511576611094	7170.338884050605	6.4630209914001346	3.095735089966611	2.0877177160109781	0.8242	1.7705616472876746	17021.942281093863	10631.7265614074	14669.536429227826	10456.857136021641	5.5196132623767644	4.0635878227340569	1.3583103166853834	0.4781	1.39286143976492667	6139.7580835904228	2621.8795522484384	6007.9109230446775	2373.6833889979162	1.9165201995435777	0.76768342917133658	2.4964980703209063	1.1489	2.21746225432961678	2698.1748141243879	2345.6197851913694	2983.7203969511033	2104.2062203623354	1.0034249144292475	0.75356624926665217	1.3315682800360955	0.4265	1.34400184472866269	3192.0182979999513	4075.1464916971877	3448.9069393598484	3768.372479684544	1.1994493694533181	1.3789360024963644	0.86983686500453128	-0.0030	0.9978884728987719210	17067.07516373635	11184.818800185194	14725.891033626784	10926.188162965253	5.0712118823024941	4.0485499462268697	1.2525995602521134	0.2397	1.180762275228342711	17601.307243628773	16035.738037325524	15194.391518495275	15507.910830308156	4.8168889588911892	4.7246670190688178	1.0195192464252321	0.0566	1.039976049264103512	36506.550879156362	16516.330620533507	29940.16152094326	15939.964426221513	9.8633817670255954	5.2606619384323423	1.8749316877725171	0.9051	1.872671807470224413	5125.2891326069248	4693.2466808099616	5158.1740852317462	4392.9964596737263	1.8535206550575092	1.5829757764884993	1.1709090452218778	0.1559	1.114141952623632914	16237.191077435988	8200.1963237859236	14074.363010204193	7989.0067863064378	4.42853422437563	2.6492014981540848	1.6716486939409292	0.7581	1.691209832390007615	3618.5843760491325	3616.132887967005	3845.4377514484863	3319.8170094016468	1.3544474388085019	1.2409132598651746	1.091492437558176	0.2969	1.228489021562851916	4342.2222019712653	4191.3722783338426	4493.1233129449683	3884.0836172640002	1.5122356774192589	1.3693519082014005	1.104344083038181	0.2799	1.214110690778593217	647.34744164673816	797.07880104849255	792.96889136199479	741.43526949227055	0.28389567611268207	0.27983180378015748	1.0145225534682873	0.0914	1.065437217930996518	7031.9606045335768	5947.1658934316165	6723.5874779338073	5669.2670090637448	2.2112194998836401	1.9762733051199781	1.1188834530907144	0.4895	1.403914481102448219	2308.5320733777294	3325.7724764487716	2595.4029023340499	3033.3413706011606	0.94317661773036832	1.1421928282197908	0.82575953414135239	0.0268	1.018741921955784720	2438.2085398699883	2488.5668876822947	2719.4122671853906	2246.3624096315175	0.99006725304901	0.83804862816990067	1.1813959474059184	0.4851	1.3997199488568468!sample_table_end
