Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413810/suppl/GSM413810_NN802.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413810/suppl/GSM413810_NN803.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16602!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	7606.8007861618717	6034.495800573075	7439.201770503123	5617.9564680168814	2.8541484165710562	2.1891180529480661	1.3037891733282267	0.6131	1.52958323542959372	3861.7639302721373	1886.8551993729964	3987.8243340042009	1788.2187407606336	1.5439797946854541	0.71221080484866484	2.1678690974275918	0.7083	1.63384640813866033	3718.7517331121926	4393.48494171317	3850.4551312345238	4123.1708709077739	1.441403122355545	1.5745005409748396	0.91546689559287908	0.0138	1.00962232032540494	12189.087095403285	9244.515100756731	11654.01948609875	8491.8395917170128	4.3557893421930256	3.1625005908060766	1.3773244358771162	0.6939	1.61767152855776925	11809.117936804711	7525.2785724008436	11218.840233538378	6954.2109144824753	4.8707794697781406	3.2090344164646192	1.5178333534809076	0.5331	1.44699684293436656	14436.54959427758	9529.8255444697006	13847.979719389425	8739.3916041096854	5.6157887688544044	3.5813596565855579	1.5680605432989259	0.6340	1.55188069856334427	3975.2123844512589	1817.2350610757128	4097.3255033563619	1723.3386049467222	1.7236862811840756	0.71702106072195526	2.4039548844611724	1.1906	2.28243940241102428	3574.1416574074879	2047.6793202976344	3710.6600601299183	1938.1926132532055	1.4219510316643684	0.76448128714264885	1.8600207167648286	0.7041	1.62911015785926339	3799.9048785183031	3479.9001701665165	3929.8197130514013	3284.4933811184874	1.716999628116022	1.4852957471679133	1.1559984813730935	0.4917	1.406057649337810110	14490.542974673921	11188.116445689391	13883.67649511383	10223.329536446421	5.3039128762830936	4.0543245156573633	1.3082112336592588	0.2811	1.21511693140843611	15720.462664016255	14851.443401455783	15212.787468637734	13624.867433067962	6.6519509819887208	5.8344192941928856	1.1401222035258145	0.1253	1.090710094600317212	17457.067646654479	14245.381662656673	17060.544949646246	13051.409702932951	7.3201686585413785	5.7437131050052068	1.274466277252325	0.5855	1.500569836299312113	4778.8090435953372	5101.6653822288781	4868.4167160364977	4769.6418302846814	1.8923093314660535	1.8705932591713443	1.0116091898590127	0.2771	1.211727755632681114	11303.103575034782	8804.5172764182444	10722.195937306353	8089.9825503022248	3.8200504854807535	2.9361022252774429	1.3010618133773539	0.2829	1.21663521670926215	3333.4857712864455	3651.7103817888228	3473.3847888068558	3444.0009883566227	1.3259419284939715	1.3654738277270879	0.97104895133807156	0.2763	1.211064121106482816	4446.6566137370464	3590.8368093012905	4548.3190681601927	3388.4748565389496	1.8414677232748176	1.3724477558604462	1.3417397605202994	0.4765	1.391326812193072217	555.60349188656176	665.74620684681588	635.97829317242406	644.60421787333109	0.29929500046852764	0.32683548712660471	0.91573593522477914	-0.0170	0.9882619925793282318	7587.3694041547633	5517.9341429587275	7419.485513516368	5146.9643170757499	2.8505315849775723	2.0053309829253005	1.4214768580592743	0.6165	1.533126745682805919	2727.4309108361299	2689.9307604866171	2876.2875330784973	2539.4149944558835	1.1753671449674412	1.0603362985666147	1.1084852480824505	0.3396	1.265430020552783820	1765.9524384647425	1784.7290849527603	1910.4199906489318	1692.6151805975985	0.98474579894536973	0.88133546367505688	1.1173336822724742	0.4026	1.3218921781605082!sample_table_end
