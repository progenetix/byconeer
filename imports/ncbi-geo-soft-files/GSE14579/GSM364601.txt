Ninety normal samples were downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and analyzed at the same time.  One CEL file for each set (Xba and Hind) with the median signal intensity across the set was selected as the reference array.   The dChip-normalized signal intensities were converted to log2 ratios and segmented as follows.  For each autosomal probe set, the log2 tumor/normal ratio of each tumor sample was calculated using the average intensity for each probe set in the normal set.  The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and segmented using the GLAD package for the R statistical environment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM364nnn/GSM364601/suppl/GSM364601.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14579!Sample_data_row_count = 57243#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1691633	2.06787037849426SNP_A-1669946	2.28319787979126SNP_A-1691463	2.06787037849426SNP_A-1647681	2.28319787979126SNP_A-1691255	2.06787037849426SNP_A-1656886	2.06787037849426SNP_A-1673751	2.28319787979126SNP_A-1641890	2.06787037849426SNP_A-1656716	2.06787037849426SNP_A-1664559	2.06787037849426SNP_A-1747116	2.06787037849426SNP_A-1657969	2.06787037849426SNP_A-1716436	2.06787037849426SNP_A-1664341	2.28319787979126SNP_A-1715866	2.06787037849426SNP_A-1750090	2.28319787979126SNP_A-1655302	2.06787037849426SNP_A-1655176	2.06787037849426SNP_A-1647119	2.06787037849426SNP_A-1749896	2.28319787979126!sample_table_end
