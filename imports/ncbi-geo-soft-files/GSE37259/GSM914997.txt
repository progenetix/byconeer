Subsequent data analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite of software (Partek Inc, St Louis, USA). In the absence of DNA from matched normal tissues, the 794 sample HapMap baseline, available from Partek, was used. Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) workflows were used to determine CNVs and LOH. Cross-platform normalisations were performed to adjust for local GC content and remove âGC-wavesâ (based on the regression model approach of Diskin et al.)[26] The binary logarithm was generated for all data and used in genomic segmentation (p=0.00001).!Sample_data_processing = CHP files generated using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. Copy number data generated in Partek Genomics Suite,  adjustment was made for local GC content and the log2 value of data generated prior to Genomic Segmentation P value 0.00001.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,,Lake!Sample_contact_email = s.l.lake@liv.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01517064869!Sample_contact_fax = 01517065883!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor, Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CH62 4US!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.loorg.org/dr-sarah-lake.html!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM914nnn/GSM914997/suppl/GSM914997_DS6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM914nnn/GSM914997/suppl/GSM914997_DS6.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37259!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.019086	AB	4201.150391	4236.470703SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.116620	BB	569.722961	1349.127563SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.004636	AB	722.181519	591.704529SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.013488	AB	2087.514404	1060.980835SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.006866	AB	1318.580078	1390.623901SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.005119	AB	1437.373169	879.640015SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.008619	AB	699.530579	802.200806SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.004931	AB	3106.148926	1803.360596SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.758428	AB	6886.819824	4105.759277SNP_A-1995832	NC	0.743862	AB	2310.122070	1683.462158SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.000509	BB	394.766479	2023.036011SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.002069	AB	2122.484619	2425.317139SNP_A-1997709	NC	0.396479	AA	602.510803	202.718948SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.068629	AB	1809.384644	1371.946533SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.064903	BB	808.942444	1262.926880SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.008645	AB	1615.149292	2586.111328SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.007700	AB	2372.999756	2115.399902SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.008229	AB	648.611206	731.055420SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.007180	AB	1391.205688	1415.339111SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.565212	AB	1379.395508	469.794434!sample_table_end
