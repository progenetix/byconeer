Subsequent data analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite of software (Partek Inc, St Louis, USA). In the absence of DNA from matched normal tissues, the 794 sample HapMap baseline, available from Partek, was used. Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) workflows were used to determine CNVs and LOH. Cross-platform normalisations were performed to adjust for local GC content and remove âGC-wavesâ (based on the regression model approach of Diskin et al.)[26] The binary logarithm was generated for all data and used in genomic segmentation (p=0.00001).!Sample_data_processing = CHP files generated using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. Copy number data generated in Partek Genomics Suite,  adjustment was made for local GC content and the log2 value of data generated prior to Genomic Segmentation P value 0.00001.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,,Lake!Sample_contact_email = s.l.lake@liv.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01517064869!Sample_contact_fax = 01517065883!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor, Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CH62 4US!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.loorg.org/dr-sarah-lake.html!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915024/suppl/GSM915024_MS8.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915024/suppl/GSM915024_MS8.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37259!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.004737	BB	1609.035889	4430.479004SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.022512	AB	970.877136	1095.266846SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.003351	AB	804.053406	764.543518SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.001367	AB	1831.046875	1333.643188SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.037062	AB	640.991638	875.713867SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.044656	AB	2014.235352	1407.085327SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.024010	AB	1122.256714	637.940918SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.023489	AB	395.301605	564.738586SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.305176	BB	5660.104492	6058.331543SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.018004	AB	1900.688965	2387.737793SNP_A-1995893	NC	0.573769	AB	640.991638	1578.172852SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.001649	AB	2176.184326	2461.371338SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.010785	AB	464.557465	440.877777SNP_A-1997896	NC	0.204150	AA	1425.750000	948.047729SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.045486	AB	417.703491	635.361450SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.013718	AB	1679.577393	2202.837646SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.014047	AB	1868.869141	1895.777710SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.059595	AB	363.176422	1316.545410SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.006960	AB	1366.989380	1283.244995SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.076829	AB	640.991638	213.952744!sample_table_end
