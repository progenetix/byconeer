Subsequent data analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite of software (Partek Inc, St Louis, USA). In the absence of DNA from matched normal tissues, the 794 sample HapMap baseline, available from Partek, was used. Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) workflows were used to determine CNVs and LOH. Cross-platform normalisations were performed to adjust for local GC content and remove âGC-wavesâ (based on the regression model approach of Diskin et al.)[26] The binary logarithm was generated for all data and used in genomic segmentation (p=0.00001).!Sample_data_processing = CHP files generated using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. Copy number data generated in Partek Genomics Suite,  adjustment was made for local GC content and the log2 value of data generated prior to Genomic Segmentation P value 0.00001.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,,Lake!Sample_contact_email = s.l.lake@liv.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01517064869!Sample_contact_fax = 01517065883!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor, Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CH62 4US!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.loorg.org/dr-sarah-lake.html!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915026/suppl/GSM915026_MS10.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915026/suppl/GSM915026_MS10.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37259!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.006815	BB	1765.868896	4529.516113SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.002819	BB	262.684479	740.148010SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.005784	AB	478.787994	1107.514160SNP_A-4263484	AA	0.023620	AA	1970.549561	440.342926SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.004811	AB	1107.514160	1376.238525SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.032249	AB	1837.653931	1380.310181SNP_A-1980898	NC	0.445377	AA	700.242126	281.837952SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.008018	AB	3495.092529	2212.342529SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.410473	AB	7979.625488	3880.627197SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.023511	AB	1634.362183	2515.056396SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.002486	AB	1257.049194	1821.981567SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.008772	AB	1639.506836	2094.324219SNP_A-1997709	NC	0.131142	AA	1000.889771	318.921173SNP_A-1997896	NC	0.200504	BB	590.786621	1744.172974SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.004102	AB	917.190796	753.473022SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.011497	AB	1921.731567	2224.480957SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.011829	AB	2836.942627	2649.066406SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.008517	AB	788.939392	682.891052SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.009696	AB	1394.684082	1577.281616SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.185031	AB	3964.771240	1789.992432!sample_table_end
