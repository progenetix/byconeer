Subsequent data analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite of software (Partek Inc, St Louis, USA). In the absence of DNA from matched normal tissues, the 794 sample HapMap baseline, available from Partek, was used. Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) workflows were used to determine CNVs and LOH. Cross-platform normalisations were performed to adjust for local GC content and remove âGC-wavesâ (based on the regression model approach of Diskin et al.)[26] The binary logarithm was generated for all data and used in genomic segmentation (p=0.00001).!Sample_data_processing = CHP files generated using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. Copy number data generated in Partek Genomics Suite,  adjustment was made for local GC content and the log2 value of data generated prior to Genomic Segmentation P value 0.00001.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,,Lake!Sample_contact_email = s.l.lake@liv.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01517064869!Sample_contact_fax = 01517065883!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor, Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CH62 4US!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.loorg.org/dr-sarah-lake.html!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915040/suppl/GSM915040_MM7.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915040/suppl/GSM915040_MM7.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37259!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.040974	BB	2458.483398	6700.382324SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.023925	AB	842.950256	787.488525SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.008906	AB	559.478699	720.507263SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.080465	AB	2646.840576	2125.152344SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.017962	AB	1260.767700	1213.775879SNP_A-4264431	NC	0.152546	AB	2885.382324	1236.468384SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.012962	AB	565.917603	490.831268SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.057112	AB	3418.913574	2333.367676SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.070283	AA	5897.103516	3286.083984SNP_A-1995832	NC	0.135970	BB	1907.181519	3186.405762SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.068192	AB	858.022034	2203.991211SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.003744	AB	2256.129395	2580.531006SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.009375	AB	675.207520	526.726624SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.057921	AB	608.772217	1141.485474SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.022645	AB	800.161377	1041.798218SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.015007	AB	1485.632324	2702.583252SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.070359	AA	4097.317871	1910.105103SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.007606	AB	705.991150	1050.040161SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.007732	AB	1846.935059	1265.158081SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.029656	AB	698.598511	240.634781!sample_table_end
