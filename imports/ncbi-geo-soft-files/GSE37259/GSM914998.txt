Subsequent data analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite of software (Partek Inc, St Louis, USA). In the absence of DNA from matched normal tissues, the 794 sample HapMap baseline, available from Partek, was used. Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) workflows were used to determine CNVs and LOH. Cross-platform normalisations were performed to adjust for local GC content and remove âGC-wavesâ (based on the regression model approach of Diskin et al.)[26] The binary logarithm was generated for all data and used in genomic segmentation (p=0.00001).!Sample_data_processing = CHP files generated using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. Copy number data generated in Partek Genomics Suite,  adjustment was made for local GC content and the log2 value of data generated prior to Genomic Segmentation P value 0.00001.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,,Lake!Sample_contact_email = s.l.lake@liv.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01517064869!Sample_contact_fax = 01517065883!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor, Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CH62 4US!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.loorg.org/dr-sarah-lake.html!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM914nnn/GSM914998/suppl/GSM914998_DS7.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM914nnn/GSM914998/suppl/GSM914998_DS7.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37259!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.028088	AB	4607.533203	4686.489258SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.011413	AB	548.608643	872.067810SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.003051	AB	825.697083	809.871155SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.031060	AB	2025.047852	2072.658691SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.049847	AB	1562.304932	870.963684SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.001244	AB	1162.063599	962.290466SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.016321	AB	648.433594	377.900208SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.008512	AB	3579.837402	2052.568604SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.494441	AA	6020.163574	3238.945557SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.008456	AB	1878.017212	1683.929077SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.003097	AB	1168.998657	1722.136841SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.002813	AB	1946.483154	2433.149170SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.003992	AB	608.702454	716.186951SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.023269	AB	742.219604	991.622070SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.001586	BB	538.551025	1219.519165SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.011527	AB	1818.310181	2237.171631SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.020311	AB	3014.694580	2760.668701SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.011999	AB	453.029144	1092.882202SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.007231	AB	1490.267944	1593.155151SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.076855	AA	1147.990845	336.262878!sample_table_end
