Subsequent data analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite of software (Partek Inc, St Louis, USA). In the absence of DNA from matched normal tissues, the 794 sample HapMap baseline, available from Partek, was used. Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) workflows were used to determine CNVs and LOH. Cross-platform normalisations were performed to adjust for local GC content and remove âGC-wavesâ (based on the regression model approach of Diskin et al.)[26] The binary logarithm was generated for all data and used in genomic segmentation (p=0.00001).!Sample_data_processing = CHP files generated using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. Copy number data generated in Partek Genomics Suite,  adjustment was made for local GC content and the log2 value of data generated prior to Genomic Segmentation P value 0.00001.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,,Lake!Sample_contact_email = s.l.lake@liv.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01517064869!Sample_contact_fax = 01517065883!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor, Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CH62 4US!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.loorg.org/dr-sarah-lake.html!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915032/suppl/GSM915032_MS16.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915032/suppl/GSM915032_MS16.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37259!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	NC	0.103346	AB	3730.691406	2581.738037SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.010853	AB	505.820404	864.286682SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.000709	AB	1281.836426	1728.177612SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.049728	AB	997.363708	1689.383423SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.014143	AB	1101.129150	1079.322876SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.025665	AB	1165.728149	580.020142SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.008763	AB	519.617004	538.446350SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.024487	AB	3582.210938	2061.482178SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.020236	AA	4649.340820	2375.574463SNP_A-1995832	NC	0.308856	AB	1519.158081	2014.191162SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.023368	AB	864.286682	1788.704102SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.011421	AB	1607.342896	2302.108398SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.007784	AB	530.950500	517.804810SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.012142	AB	1020.478638	1013.070496SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.040707	BB	433.894379	809.450195SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.013970	AB	1399.442017	2586.964844SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.046511	AA	3394.205078	2001.727783SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.011969	AB	489.069122	966.523254SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.016343	AB	1032.979248	1076.782227SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.009315	AB	613.117798	529.780640!sample_table_end
