Subsequent data analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite of software (Partek Inc, St Louis, USA). In the absence of DNA from matched normal tissues, the 794 sample HapMap baseline, available from Partek, was used. Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) workflows were used to determine CNVs and LOH. Cross-platform normalisations were performed to adjust for local GC content and remove âGC-wavesâ (based on the regression model approach of Diskin et al.)[26] The binary logarithm was generated for all data and used in genomic segmentation (p=0.00001).!Sample_data_processing = CHP files generated using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. Copy number data generated in Partek Genomics Suite,  adjustment was made for local GC content and the log2 value of data generated prior to Genomic Segmentation P value 0.00001.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,,Lake!Sample_contact_email = s.l.lake@liv.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01517064869!Sample_contact_fax = 01517065883!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor, Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CH62 4US!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.loorg.org/dr-sarah-lake.html!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915008/suppl/GSM915008_DM7.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915008/suppl/GSM915008_DM7.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37259!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.063795	BB	2113.380127	4354.876465SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.002602	AB	691.719360	849.113892SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.006686	AB	1026.626465	637.502075SNP_A-4263484	NC	0.168524	AA	1638.526489	331.200165SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.010785	AB	1201.941040	1142.323120SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.007665	AB	1630.796509	950.421509SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.010069	AB	528.939148	466.511780SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.004998	AB	2633.986328	1464.334717SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.607362	AB	7371.425293	4049.684814SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.008823	AB	1524.369141	1976.102051SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.044885	AB	817.766113	2055.646240SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.012746	AB	1615.875977	1894.100708SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.016493	AB	260.508301	590.542236SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.003904	AB	1116.668945	1341.198975SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.007034	BB	618.977722	1234.963257SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.022247	AB	1719.272949	1944.064087SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.049892	AA	4111.182617	2217.897461SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.018043	AB	415.882935	1155.947266SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.017294	AB	931.053833	1246.572266SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.014547	AA	2047.430054	453.752228!sample_table_end
