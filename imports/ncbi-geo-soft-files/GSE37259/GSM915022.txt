Subsequent data analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite of software (Partek Inc, St Louis, USA). In the absence of DNA from matched normal tissues, the 794 sample HapMap baseline, available from Partek, was used. Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) workflows were used to determine CNVs and LOH. Cross-platform normalisations were performed to adjust for local GC content and remove âGC-wavesâ (based on the regression model approach of Diskin et al.)[26] The binary logarithm was generated for all data and used in genomic segmentation (p=0.00001).!Sample_data_processing = CHP files generated using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. Copy number data generated in Partek Genomics Suite,  adjustment was made for local GC content and the log2 value of data generated prior to Genomic Segmentation P value 0.00001.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,,Lake!Sample_contact_email = s.l.lake@liv.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01517064869!Sample_contact_fax = 01517065883!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor, Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CH62 4US!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.loorg.org/dr-sarah-lake.html!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915022/suppl/GSM915022_MS6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915022/suppl/GSM915022_MS6.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37259!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.025693	BB	2792.807861	5912.536621SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.067856	BB	447.596741	1566.281006SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.003591	AB	1152.922119	1931.206177SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.045800	AB	1566.281006	2106.417480SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.038203	AB	1716.551880	1298.677734SNP_A-4264431	BB	0.083064	BB	1380.974487	1988.576416SNP_A-1980898	NC	0.123018	BB	285.600830	642.145996SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.015104	AB	3814.440430	2564.218018SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.705084	AA	6657.833496	3439.420898SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.005337	AB	1758.829834	1589.174194SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.003595	AB	1442.601929	1928.917725SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.003499	AB	1945.357422	2344.860596SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.026508	AB	1595.160889	601.972534SNP_A-1997896	NC	0.378287	AB	1302.455200	957.002441SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.004641	AB	771.106873	672.695190SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.005559	AB	1815.634644	2569.307617SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.030163	AA	3939.570312	1992.985718SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.003863	AB	761.521362	1024.310059SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.009860	AB	1187.116577	1019.458252SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.010102	AB	980.653076	455.771332!sample_table_end
