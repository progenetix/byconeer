Subsequent data analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite of software (Partek Inc, St Louis, USA). In the absence of DNA from matched normal tissues, the 794 sample HapMap baseline, available from Partek, was used. Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) workflows were used to determine CNVs and LOH. Cross-platform normalisations were performed to adjust for local GC content and remove âGC-wavesâ (based on the regression model approach of Diskin et al.)[26] The binary logarithm was generated for all data and used in genomic segmentation (p=0.00001).!Sample_data_processing = CHP files generated using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. Copy number data generated in Partek Genomics Suite,  adjustment was made for local GC content and the log2 value of data generated prior to Genomic Segmentation P value 0.00001.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,,Lake!Sample_contact_email = s.l.lake@liv.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01517064869!Sample_contact_fax = 01517065883!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor, Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CH62 4US!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.loorg.org/dr-sarah-lake.html!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915030/suppl/GSM915030_MS14.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915030/suppl/GSM915030_MS14.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37259!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.071312	AA	5524.548340	3096.155762SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.006557	AB	611.209900	910.904663SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.008111	AB	505.640015	227.445663SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.009415	AB	1307.078125	1405.438110SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.008437	AB	1323.361694	1285.887085SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.004787	AB	923.815857	941.682922SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.012595	AB	524.588806	755.224670SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.016272	AB	3772.390869	2273.150391SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.455404	AA	5119.938477	3345.782715SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.038543	AB	2510.601318	1826.248413SNP_A-1995893	NC	0.100723	AB	623.217407	1526.454590SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.001553	AB	2294.500488	2455.028564SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.006290	AB	910.904663	491.353180SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.090821	AB	1276.020386	1031.977295SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.012864	AB	1052.316406	960.313599SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.007364	AB	1468.012451	2598.218994SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.049266	AB	3395.463379	2616.119873SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.004319	AB	981.367920	826.224060SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.001871	AB	1870.460693	1531.542969SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.192940	AA	1242.239380	380.664978!sample_table_end
