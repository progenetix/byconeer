Subsequent data analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite of software (Partek Inc, St Louis, USA). In the absence of DNA from matched normal tissues, the 794 sample HapMap baseline, available from Partek, was used. Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) workflows were used to determine CNVs and LOH. Cross-platform normalisations were performed to adjust for local GC content and remove âGC-wavesâ (based on the regression model approach of Diskin et al.)[26] The binary logarithm was generated for all data and used in genomic segmentation (p=0.00001).!Sample_data_processing = CHP files generated using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. Copy number data generated in Partek Genomics Suite,  adjustment was made for local GC content and the log2 value of data generated prior to Genomic Segmentation P value 0.00001.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,,Lake!Sample_contact_email = s.l.lake@liv.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01517064869!Sample_contact_fax = 01517065883!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor, Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CH62 4US!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.loorg.org/dr-sarah-lake.html!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915003/suppl/GSM915003_DM2.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915003/suppl/GSM915003_DM2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37259!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.022790	AA	4368.427246	1993.963501SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.020332	AB	956.466309	1033.251831SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.002041	AB	975.156921	1524.106567SNP_A-4263484	AA	0.080042	AA	2366.753662	737.219849SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.003666	AB	1274.061768	1511.753418SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.046285	AB	2190.507080	1300.524292SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.002567	AB	732.289917	706.050415SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.006017	AB	3237.778809	1830.780762SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.295751	AA	4930.561035	2612.131592SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.003375	AB	1658.460083	1511.714600SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.033547	AB	1623.926636	2697.861816SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.006483	AB	1668.072144	2765.974609SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.005640	AB	716.544983	826.951721SNP_A-1997896	BB	0.014757	BB	486.099457	1864.879761SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.020904	BB	535.477722	973.880188SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.005832	AB	1760.008911	2957.729492SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.002119	AB	2399.030273	2407.999512SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.005131	AB	660.685059	1007.340942SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.006262	AB	1424.015869	1234.974609SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.040433	AB	493.074890	163.600281!sample_table_end
