Subsequent data analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite of software (Partek Inc, St Louis, USA). In the absence of DNA from matched normal tissues, the 794 sample HapMap baseline, available from Partek, was used. Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) workflows were used to determine CNVs and LOH. Cross-platform normalisations were performed to adjust for local GC content and remove âGC-wavesâ (based on the regression model approach of Diskin et al.)[26] The binary logarithm was generated for all data and used in genomic segmentation (p=0.00001).!Sample_data_processing = CHP files generated using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. Copy number data generated in Partek Genomics Suite,  adjustment was made for local GC content and the log2 value of data generated prior to Genomic Segmentation P value 0.00001.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,,Lake!Sample_contact_email = s.l.lake@liv.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01517064869!Sample_contact_fax = 01517065883!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor, Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CH62 4US!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.loorg.org/dr-sarah-lake.html!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM914nnn/GSM914992/suppl/GSM914992_DS1.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM914nnn/GSM914992/suppl/GSM914992_DS1.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37259!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.006210	BB	1839.053955	4983.838867SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.116761	BB	557.357910	1773.852661SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.005671	AB	567.455078	483.009796SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.018905	AB	1982.629395	837.090210SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.009863	AB	1247.225464	1201.323364SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.098028	AB	2618.164307	1035.596924SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.025787	AB	428.407013	357.806915SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.003008	AB	2898.751465	1930.406250SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.738993	AB	4911.021973	4534.612793SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.012883	AB	1376.985107	2024.093750SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.033589	AB	857.679016	2044.274048SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.009806	AB	1565.351440	2079.224609SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.012877	AB	339.972412	453.391266SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.014048	AB	1031.013428	1014.957886SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.066103	BB	406.675018	814.724121SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.008544	AB	1661.244629	2498.592041SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.030829	AA	3535.308350	2071.039062SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.003941	AB	820.772827	958.193726SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.005375	AB	1539.110474	1197.922974SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.008213	AB	1247.225464	608.697144!sample_table_end
