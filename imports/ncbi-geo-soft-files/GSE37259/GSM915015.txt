Subsequent data analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite of software (Partek Inc, St Louis, USA). In the absence of DNA from matched normal tissues, the 794 sample HapMap baseline, available from Partek, was used. Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) workflows were used to determine CNVs and LOH. Cross-platform normalisations were performed to adjust for local GC content and remove âGC-wavesâ (based on the regression model approach of Diskin et al.)[26] The binary logarithm was generated for all data and used in genomic segmentation (p=0.00001).!Sample_data_processing = CHP files generated using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. Copy number data generated in Partek Genomics Suite,  adjustment was made for local GC content and the log2 value of data generated prior to Genomic Segmentation P value 0.00001.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,,Lake!Sample_contact_email = s.l.lake@liv.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01517064869!Sample_contact_fax = 01517065883!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor, Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CH62 4US!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.loorg.org/dr-sarah-lake.html!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915015/suppl/GSM915015_DM14.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915015/suppl/GSM915015_DM14.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37259!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.033155	BB	2517.508545	5679.996094SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.165444	BB	369.449554	635.903748SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.014400	AB	887.434875	430.470306SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.068806	AB	1373.080200	2324.015137SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.013533	AB	922.407288	1157.256348SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.001030	AB	1173.974731	962.240295SNP_A-1980898	AA	0.031504	AA	812.094604	302.967712SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.020559	AB	3407.373535	2059.938965SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.043789	AA	5761.912598	3463.559570SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.038740	AA	2728.992676	1734.251831SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.008592	AB	1604.155273	2092.656738SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.006114	AB	1952.539429	2320.520752SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.011953	AB	1530.110474	583.509521SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.050116	AB	1126.017944	941.066467SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.021306	AB	782.172607	1047.839844SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.011221	AB	1607.804932	2467.023926SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.037832	AA	3289.693848	1889.673706SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.035388	AB	528.512451	245.480682SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.015392	AB	1146.395874	1277.678955SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.031438	AB	344.654724	305.953979!sample_table_end
