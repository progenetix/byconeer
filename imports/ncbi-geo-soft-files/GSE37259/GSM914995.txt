Subsequent data analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite of software (Partek Inc, St Louis, USA). In the absence of DNA from matched normal tissues, the 794 sample HapMap baseline, available from Partek, was used. Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) workflows were used to determine CNVs and LOH. Cross-platform normalisations were performed to adjust for local GC content and remove âGC-wavesâ (based on the regression model approach of Diskin et al.)[26] The binary logarithm was generated for all data and used in genomic segmentation (p=0.00001).!Sample_data_processing = CHP files generated using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. Copy number data generated in Partek Genomics Suite,  adjustment was made for local GC content and the log2 value of data generated prior to Genomic Segmentation P value 0.00001.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,,Lake!Sample_contact_email = s.l.lake@liv.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01517064869!Sample_contact_fax = 01517065883!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor, Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CH62 4US!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.loorg.org/dr-sarah-lake.html!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM914nnn/GSM914995/suppl/GSM914995_DS4.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM914nnn/GSM914995/suppl/GSM914995_DS4.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37259!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.023438	BB	2751.177979	7308.224121SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.090181	AB	1081.047729	1797.750610SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.002359	AB	844.805664	938.018982SNP_A-4263484	NC	0.180557	AB	2453.111084	3364.462891SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.010809	AB	1305.617676	1221.041260SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.002817	AB	1396.237793	1080.819458SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.005429	AB	714.130737	759.859924SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.005550	AB	3201.412598	1842.873413SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.692219	AA	6500.074219	3783.186035SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.007204	AB	1743.026245	1892.350464SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.010569	AB	1281.675293	2172.502686SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.006578	AB	1662.319214	2766.746826SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.009777	AB	1181.239380	983.213501SNP_A-1997896	NC	0.280176	BB	536.108887	1544.203491SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.006421	AB	813.153931	929.779846SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.012002	AB	1493.821533	2517.681152SNP_A-2000332	NC	0.175258	AB	2776.724121	1886.674194SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.006324	AB	1412.646851	1065.251465SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.002468	AB	2340.245850	1669.672607SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.043148	AB	1974.838867	715.398499!sample_table_end
