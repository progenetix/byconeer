Subsequent data analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite of software (Partek Inc, St Louis, USA). In the absence of DNA from matched normal tissues, the 794 sample HapMap baseline, available from Partek, was used. Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) workflows were used to determine CNVs and LOH. Cross-platform normalisations were performed to adjust for local GC content and remove âGC-wavesâ (based on the regression model approach of Diskin et al.)[26] The binary logarithm was generated for all data and used in genomic segmentation (p=0.00001).!Sample_data_processing = CHP files generated using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. Copy number data generated in Partek Genomics Suite,  adjustment was made for local GC content and the log2 value of data generated prior to Genomic Segmentation P value 0.00001.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,,Lake!Sample_contact_email = s.l.lake@liv.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01517064869!Sample_contact_fax = 01517065883!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor, Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CH62 4US!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.loorg.org/dr-sarah-lake.html!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915000/suppl/GSM915000_DS9.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915000/suppl/GSM915000_DS9.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37259!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.015343	BB	2373.004883	5817.162598SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.070059	AB	447.089752	887.921082SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.018051	AB	936.918579	307.006470SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.012371	AB	1750.846802	750.415405SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.018873	AB	1267.645630	884.064514SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.020652	AB	603.979614	676.115234SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.038936	AB	483.899109	833.932373SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.030502	AB	1761.222412	867.539917SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.486003	AB	7445.392090	4128.239746SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.024130	BB	1459.702759	2201.891846SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.017193	AB	1004.853882	2066.860352SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.007800	AB	1784.377319	2938.008301SNP_A-1997709	NC	0.108555	AB	415.982391	804.629761SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.011808	AB	756.203674	1380.131592SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.007454	BB	626.066772	1254.418579SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.017049	AB	1047.030029	2776.096436SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.028584	AA	3418.365479	2074.697754SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.003353	AB	861.473022	927.001648SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.012393	AB	1163.470337	1460.379028SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.001024	AB	836.370544	706.202759!sample_table_end
