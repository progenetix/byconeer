Subsequent data analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite of software (Partek Inc, St Louis, USA). In the absence of DNA from matched normal tissues, the 794 sample HapMap baseline, available from Partek, was used. Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) workflows were used to determine CNVs and LOH. Cross-platform normalisations were performed to adjust for local GC content and remove âGC-wavesâ (based on the regression model approach of Diskin et al.)[26] The binary logarithm was generated for all data and used in genomic segmentation (p=0.00001).!Sample_data_processing = CHP files generated using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. Copy number data generated in Partek Genomics Suite,  adjustment was made for local GC content and the log2 value of data generated prior to Genomic Segmentation P value 0.00001.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,,Lake!Sample_contact_email = s.l.lake@liv.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01517064869!Sample_contact_fax = 01517065883!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor, Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CH62 4US!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.loorg.org/dr-sarah-lake.html!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915005/suppl/GSM915005_DM4.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915005/suppl/GSM915005_DM4.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37259!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.029015	BB	2333.176514	4864.650391SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.003495	AB	682.721497	572.857544SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.002963	AB	904.244080	1557.714600SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.042801	AB	2452.191162	1071.017090SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.012182	AB	1038.531860	1076.889526SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.050571	AA	1056.568604	364.572479SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.062500	AB	204.341171	330.719360SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.005843	AB	3068.073242	1681.743774SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.228704	AA	3593.794678	2340.505127SNP_A-1995832	NC	0.109565	AB	1986.925781	3870.040771SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.099610	AB	1235.438843	3105.241455SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.010761	AB	1603.547363	1996.114380SNP_A-1997709	NC	0.142113	AB	1061.817505	387.205627SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.084325	AA	446.827148	331.392944SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.011456	AB	603.636780	648.963379SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.009374	AB	1564.850586	2710.818848SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.025541	AA	3350.624023	1951.779297SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.012925	AB	574.103394	552.908081SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.005355	AB	1777.898560	1077.869873SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.026050	AB	526.228760	214.625793!sample_table_end
