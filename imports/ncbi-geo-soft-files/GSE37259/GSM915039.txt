Subsequent data analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite of software (Partek Inc, St Louis, USA). In the absence of DNA from matched normal tissues, the 794 sample HapMap baseline, available from Partek, was used. Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) workflows were used to determine CNVs and LOH. Cross-platform normalisations were performed to adjust for local GC content and remove âGC-wavesâ (based on the regression model approach of Diskin et al.)[26] The binary logarithm was generated for all data and used in genomic segmentation (p=0.00001).!Sample_data_processing = CHP files generated using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. Copy number data generated in Partek Genomics Suite,  adjustment was made for local GC content and the log2 value of data generated prior to Genomic Segmentation P value 0.00001.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,,Lake!Sample_contact_email = s.l.lake@liv.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01517064869!Sample_contact_fax = 01517065883!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor, Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CH62 4US!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.loorg.org/dr-sarah-lake.html!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915039/suppl/GSM915039_MM6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915039/suppl/GSM915039_MM6.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37259!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.016325	BB	1804.399170	4554.450684SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.051742	AB	570.621033	1160.386230SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.009350	AB	475.364441	756.762695SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.090001	BB	1141.061401	2326.553467SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.017088	AB	1216.310913	1189.394897SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.017194	AB	737.520020	787.160889SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.013386	BB	269.002106	744.756653SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.012869	AB	2777.615479	1753.866211SNP_A-4265735	BB	0.066276	BB	3039.775879	4863.279297SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.090131	AA	3187.231934	1647.617310SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.036440	AB	965.186829	2073.497559SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.007386	AB	1998.420776	2564.064697SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.020684	AB	1380.960083	559.207520SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.025466	AB	840.289490	918.980835SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.070861	BB	223.171234	729.050598SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.025769	AB	1300.563599	2449.507812SNP_A-2000332	NC	0.104058	AB	3163.300293	2102.815918SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.015200	AB	438.893799	868.258789SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.039448	AB	834.280762	1041.002197SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.031866	AB	547.769348	234.896759!sample_table_end
