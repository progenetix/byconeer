Subsequent data analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite of software (Partek Inc, St Louis, USA). In the absence of DNA from matched normal tissues, the 794 sample HapMap baseline, available from Partek, was used. Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) workflows were used to determine CNVs and LOH. Cross-platform normalisations were performed to adjust for local GC content and remove âGC-wavesâ (based on the regression model approach of Diskin et al.)[26] The binary logarithm was generated for all data and used in genomic segmentation (p=0.00001).!Sample_data_processing = CHP files generated using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. Copy number data generated in Partek Genomics Suite,  adjustment was made for local GC content and the log2 value of data generated prior to Genomic Segmentation P value 0.00001.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,,Lake!Sample_contact_email = s.l.lake@liv.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01517064869!Sample_contact_fax = 01517065883!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor, Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CH62 4US!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.loorg.org/dr-sarah-lake.html!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915027/suppl/GSM915027_MS11.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915027/suppl/GSM915027_MS11.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37259!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.006964	BB	1868.354736	5113.292480SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.003232	AB	564.575378	798.955627SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.005106	AB	477.059052	675.022400SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.020263	AB	1146.445923	1532.422729SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.035844	AB	1626.598999	1117.936401SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.009537	AB	823.786499	767.006165SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.010949	AB	449.943817	511.040497SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.009083	AB	3464.399170	1953.305420SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.564246	AA	6168.384277	2782.203613SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.041486	BB	1664.893799	2342.191162SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.003579	AB	1122.260498	1727.044922SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.006708	AB	1881.353760	2095.538818SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.002959	AB	1320.707397	747.998596SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.099364	AA	1103.137695	680.670837SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.008773	AB	670.302429	830.594238SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.008466	AB	1380.091187	2815.155762SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.010435	AA	3673.827393	1738.718018SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.005662	AB	1269.094238	881.856506SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.003299	AB	1954.666992	1267.451294SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.044205	AB	823.786499	281.894531!sample_table_end
