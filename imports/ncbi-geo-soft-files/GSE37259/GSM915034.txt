Subsequent data analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite of software (Partek Inc, St Louis, USA). In the absence of DNA from matched normal tissues, the 794 sample HapMap baseline, available from Partek, was used. Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) workflows were used to determine CNVs and LOH. Cross-platform normalisations were performed to adjust for local GC content and remove âGC-wavesâ (based on the regression model approach of Diskin et al.)[26] The binary logarithm was generated for all data and used in genomic segmentation (p=0.00001).!Sample_data_processing = CHP files generated using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. Copy number data generated in Partek Genomics Suite,  adjustment was made for local GC content and the log2 value of data generated prior to Genomic Segmentation P value 0.00001.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,,Lake!Sample_contact_email = s.l.lake@liv.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01517064869!Sample_contact_fax = 01517065883!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor, Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CH62 4US!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.loorg.org/dr-sarah-lake.html!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915034/suppl/GSM915034_MM1.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915034/suppl/GSM915034_MM1.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37259!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.038224	AB	4585.352539	3798.725830SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.015770	AB	555.902771	1037.592773SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.007564	AB	247.458984	744.553223SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.012413	AB	1326.370728	780.580566SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.056094	AB	1778.549927	1147.616821SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.043431	AB	2274.790283	1193.120728SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.011567	AB	676.892090	817.465576SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.007272	AB	3257.099121	1783.238525SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.336902	AB	8126.966309	4012.401123SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.010924	AB	1971.033691	1840.674438SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.033732	AB	852.654907	2141.443848SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.004025	AB	1921.880737	2339.221680SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.004653	AB	546.603271	642.494141SNP_A-1997896	NC	0.268851	AA	1044.634644	700.361755SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.013090	AB	891.172302	1046.823120SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.010607	AB	1379.999512	2416.058594SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.056194	AA	3501.400146	2341.751465SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.009890	AB	617.334717	1109.743408SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.009634	AB	1175.879639	1349.989990SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.004159	AB	923.610596	532.617493!sample_table_end
