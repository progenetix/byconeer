Subsequent data analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite of software (Partek Inc, St Louis, USA). In the absence of DNA from matched normal tissues, the 794 sample HapMap baseline, available from Partek, was used. Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) workflows were used to determine CNVs and LOH. Cross-platform normalisations were performed to adjust for local GC content and remove âGC-wavesâ (based on the regression model approach of Diskin et al.)[26] The binary logarithm was generated for all data and used in genomic segmentation (p=0.00001).!Sample_data_processing = CHP files generated using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. Copy number data generated in Partek Genomics Suite,  adjustment was made for local GC content and the log2 value of data generated prior to Genomic Segmentation P value 0.00001.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,,Lake!Sample_contact_email = s.l.lake@liv.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01517064869!Sample_contact_fax = 01517065883!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor, Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CH62 4US!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.loorg.org/dr-sarah-lake.html!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915044/suppl/GSM915044_MM11.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915044/suppl/GSM915044_MM11.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37259!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	NC	0.382313	BB	1934.537842	3811.421631SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.011648	AB	527.720276	910.438599SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.007659	AB	503.523438	637.733276SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.006619	AB	1664.109253	1674.190674SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.021374	AB	1193.203613	971.306152SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.025797	AB	981.393188	577.772400SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.025839	AB	358.954315	544.229736SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.005019	AB	2233.451660	1381.456787SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.149433	BB	3081.045410	4524.184570SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.006974	AB	1604.561523	1503.468506SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.007781	BB	429.406189	1694.283691SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.006120	AB	2149.386230	2221.079346SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.010788	AB	491.636475	456.191345SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.050050	AB	1232.904053	1011.839539SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.019782	AB	574.732727	742.462585SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.021457	AB	1403.455078	2226.195557SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.016768	AB	2577.533203	3284.618652SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.016580	AB	304.174591	816.091248SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.023250	AB	990.353638	1307.115356SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.012872	AB	641.768372	347.130676!sample_table_end
