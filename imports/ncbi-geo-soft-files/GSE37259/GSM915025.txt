Subsequent data analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite of software (Partek Inc, St Louis, USA). In the absence of DNA from matched normal tissues, the 794 sample HapMap baseline, available from Partek, was used. Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) workflows were used to determine CNVs and LOH. Cross-platform normalisations were performed to adjust for local GC content and remove âGC-wavesâ (based on the regression model approach of Diskin et al.)[26] The binary logarithm was generated for all data and used in genomic segmentation (p=0.00001).!Sample_data_processing = CHP files generated using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. Copy number data generated in Partek Genomics Suite,  adjustment was made for local GC content and the log2 value of data generated prior to Genomic Segmentation P value 0.00001.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,,Lake!Sample_contact_email = s.l.lake@liv.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01517064869!Sample_contact_fax = 01517065883!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor, Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CH62 4US!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.loorg.org/dr-sarah-lake.html!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915025/suppl/GSM915025_MS9.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915025/suppl/GSM915025_MS9.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37259!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.005771	AB	1234.683472	1087.614746SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.037774	BB	507.715698	1183.407593SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.003232	AB	745.446594	805.946350SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.012199	AB	2118.939453	1151.971802SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.025862	AB	1540.606323	1170.063110SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.037512	AB	1980.558838	1367.027710SNP_A-1980898	AA	0.010418	AA	1403.055908	281.470062SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.009415	AB	915.156921	1054.369263SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.385465	AA	5396.786621	3150.743408SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.024487	AB	2201.044922	1933.686890SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.024642	AB	915.156921	1996.948975SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.004673	AB	1722.551147	2531.286133SNP_A-1997709	NC	0.125126	BB	655.948853	1087.614746SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.001351	AB	982.504211	1586.108521SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.016030	AB	1020.593994	687.318481SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.006404	AB	2332.565918	2536.545654SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.022895	AB	3044.936279	2720.557861SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.003146	AB	1258.081299	1298.072266SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.005571	AB	1912.429810	1053.299072SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.007403	AB	1516.160522	950.803589!sample_table_end
