Subsequent data analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite of software (Partek Inc, St Louis, USA). In the absence of DNA from matched normal tissues, the 794 sample HapMap baseline, available from Partek, was used. Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) workflows were used to determine CNVs and LOH. Cross-platform normalisations were performed to adjust for local GC content and remove âGC-wavesâ (based on the regression model approach of Diskin et al.)[26] The binary logarithm was generated for all data and used in genomic segmentation (p=0.00001).!Sample_data_processing = CHP files generated using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. Copy number data generated in Partek Genomics Suite,  adjustment was made for local GC content and the log2 value of data generated prior to Genomic Segmentation P value 0.00001.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,,Lake!Sample_contact_email = s.l.lake@liv.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01517064869!Sample_contact_fax = 01517065883!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor, Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CH62 4US!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.loorg.org/dr-sarah-lake.html!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915018/suppl/GSM915018_MS2.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915018/suppl/GSM915018_MS2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37259!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.015180	BB	2405.243164	6700.022461SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.017405	BB	447.881012	1169.629883SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.006454	AB	362.522064	664.122498SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.003817	AB	1673.687622	1492.777344SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.012637	AB	1125.484741	1059.141113SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.001276	AB	1269.426514	1037.872803SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.031076	AB	744.964600	973.223206SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.058211	AB	3630.230713	3357.668945SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.503003	AA	5977.305664	2476.325195SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.023000	AB	1874.749023	2557.732910SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.005325	AB	1258.092773	1972.269409SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.007453	AB	1596.859009	2246.905029SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.011547	AA	1435.946289	347.023346SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.080904	AB	813.942200	840.918701SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.007610	AB	673.528564	831.538391SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.017934	AB	1355.439575	2350.453613SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.009510	AA	3310.896729	1609.491089SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.004116	AB	745.270813	1004.024231SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.006995	AB	1469.589233	1032.717163SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.119321	AB	729.152283	245.821793!sample_table_end
