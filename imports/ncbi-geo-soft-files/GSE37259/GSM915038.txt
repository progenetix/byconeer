Subsequent data analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite of software (Partek Inc, St Louis, USA). In the absence of DNA from matched normal tissues, the 794 sample HapMap baseline, available from Partek, was used. Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) workflows were used to determine CNVs and LOH. Cross-platform normalisations were performed to adjust for local GC content and remove âGC-wavesâ (based on the regression model approach of Diskin et al.)[26] The binary logarithm was generated for all data and used in genomic segmentation (p=0.00001).!Sample_data_processing = CHP files generated using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. Copy number data generated in Partek Genomics Suite,  adjustment was made for local GC content and the log2 value of data generated prior to Genomic Segmentation P value 0.00001.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,,Lake!Sample_contact_email = s.l.lake@liv.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01517064869!Sample_contact_fax = 01517065883!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor, Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CH62 4US!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.loorg.org/dr-sarah-lake.html!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915038/suppl/GSM915038_MM5.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915038/suppl/GSM915038_MM5.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37259!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.033144	BB	2308.871094	5938.568848SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.004343	AB	576.594055	749.362305SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.009566	AB	570.266541	639.041016SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.090996	AB	1709.085083	2259.091797SNP_A-1978185	NC	0.114126	AB	1938.396973	1384.352783SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.018041	AB	708.536560	800.290100SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.087707	AB	602.645874	1021.048096SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.049682	AB	3467.346436	2232.036377SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.089903	AA	6503.526367	3485.526367SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.005729	AB	1490.766602	1348.448486SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.040381	AB	830.690857	1911.557495SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.006423	AB	2263.206055	2341.154297SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.018802	AB	694.708130	409.184021SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.026293	AB	885.360962	907.493225SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.051035	AB	666.134460	951.175232SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.019753	AB	1377.860352	2614.998535SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.016007	AB	2852.213379	2797.304688SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.013475	AB	498.795776	883.168518SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.032405	AB	934.781860	1039.521729SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.022325	AB	884.025330	357.739746!sample_table_end
