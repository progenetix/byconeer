Subsequent data analysis was performed using the Partek Genomics Suite of software (Partek Inc, St Louis, USA). In the absence of DNA from matched normal tissues, the 794 sample HapMap baseline, available from Partek, was used. Copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) workflows were used to determine CNVs and LOH. Cross-platform normalisations were performed to adjust for local GC content and remove âGC-wavesâ (based on the regression model approach of Diskin et al.)[26] The binary logarithm was generated for all data and used in genomic segmentation (p=0.00001).!Sample_data_processing = CHP files generated using Affymetrix Genotyping Console software. Copy number data generated in Partek Genomics Suite,  adjustment was made for local GC content and the log2 value of data generated prior to Genomic Segmentation P value 0.00001.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,,Lake!Sample_contact_email = s.l.lake@liv.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 01517064869!Sample_contact_fax = 01517065883!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor, Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CH62 4US!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.loorg.org/dr-sarah-lake.html!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915029/suppl/GSM915029_MS13.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM915nnn/GSM915029/suppl/GSM915029_MS13.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37259!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.018246	AB	3212.224609	4436.068359SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.002679	AB	545.029663	713.189941SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.003640	AB	769.965820	725.124390SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.037667	AB	1274.938721	2058.866943SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.003566	AB	1271.497559	1490.704346SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.045686	AB	407.562958	513.371887SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.027712	AB	311.261505	495.856110SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.008007	AB	3370.707520	1947.352905SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.440199	AA	5693.614258	2744.999268SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.016011	AA	3166.601318	1647.713501SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.014371	AB	985.341370	1972.648071SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.003437	AB	1938.907471	2681.518311SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.002931	AB	682.706238	612.318970SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.056674	AA	965.050720	504.386627SNP_A-1997922	NC	0.286541	BB	516.855042	845.681946SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.007552	AB	1445.222290	2891.075195SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.039764	AA	4022.443604	2319.967529SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.020114	AB	261.185272	954.838867SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.013151	AB	904.892883	1143.243286SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.008873	AB	434.609314	381.117249!sample_table_end
