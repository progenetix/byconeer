A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771110/suppl/GSM771110_GN-980327N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771110/suppl/GSM771110_GN-980327N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-1.021008	1.629401	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	0.004603	1.629502	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.116050	1.629522	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.196446	1.631034	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.065920	1.631058	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.556456	1.644625	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.189702	1.662662	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.273381	1.662747	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.133247	1.663190	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.370912	1.663213	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	-0.359303	1.679697	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.257781	1.518181	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.515377	1.518209	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.197985	1.518215	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-1.157774	1.518217	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.116085	1.518250	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.012254	1.518708	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.319629	1.518713	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.129872	2.020993	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.146618	2.020993	nan	nan!sample_table_end
