A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770925/suppl/GSM770925_GC-73813499T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770925/suppl/GSM770925_GC-73813499T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	4.000000	1	51586	0.496385	3.460768	nan	nanCN_473964	4.000000	1	51659	-0.139674	3.460977	nan	nanCN_473965	4.000000	1	51674	0.123490	3.461020	nan	nanCN_473981	4.000000	1	52771	-0.036666	3.464167	nan	nanCN_473982	4.000000	1	52788	0.768934	3.464216	nan	nanCN_497981	4.000000	1	62627	1.200255	3.492559	nan	nanCN_502615	4.000000	1	75787	-0.097762	3.530710	nan	nanCN_502613	4.000000	1	75849	0.462630	3.530890	nan	nanCN_502614	4.000000	1	76175	0.445224	3.531837	nan	nanCN_502616	4.000000	1	76192	0.954935	3.531886	nan	nanCN_502843	4.000000	1	88453	0.754807	3.567534	nan	nanCN_466171	4.000000	1	218557	0.114210	2.443868	nan	nanCN_468414	4.000000	1	218926	0.563882	2.443386	nan	nanCN_468412	4.000000	1	219009	0.620624	2.443277	nan	nanCN_468413	4.000000	1	219024	1.155110	2.443258	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.560080	2.442675	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.019919	2.434753	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.759576	2.434677	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.391101	2.404633	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.095609	2.404632	nan	nan!sample_table_end
