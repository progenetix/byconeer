A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770562/suppl/GSM770562_GC-2001135T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770562/suppl/GSM770562_GC-2001135T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	3.000000	1	51586	0.473499	3.042298	nan	nanCN_473964	3.000000	1	51659	0.143186	3.042401	nan	nanCN_473965	3.000000	1	51674	-0.153631	3.042422	nan	nanCN_473981	3.000000	1	52771	0.201145	3.043957	nan	nanCN_473982	3.000000	1	52788	0.165879	3.043981	nan	nanCN_497981	3.000000	1	62627	1.232826	3.057475	nan	nanCN_502615	3.000000	1	75787	0.304152	3.074674	nan	nanCN_502613	3.000000	1	75849	0.122210	3.074753	nan	nanCN_502614	3.000000	1	76175	0.497562	3.075166	nan	nanCN_502616	3.000000	1	76192	0.325269	3.075187	nan	nanCN_502843	3.000000	1	88453	0.418735	3.090209	nan	nanCN_466171	3.000000	1	218557	-0.229932	2.345941	nan	nanCN_468414	3.000000	1	218926	0.463773	2.345995	nan	nanCN_468412	3.000000	1	219009	0.184591	2.346008	nan	nanCN_468413	3.000000	1	219024	0.425237	2.346010	nan	nanCN_470565	3.000000	1	219470	-0.350329	2.346075	nan	nanCN_468424	3.000000	1	225521	0.185324	2.346968	nan	nanCN_468425	3.000000	1	225579	0.218242	2.346977	nan	nanCN_460512	3.000000	1	346294	0.323494	2.246738	nan	nanCN_460513	3.000000	1	346393	-0.136926	2.246737	nan	nan!sample_table_end
