A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM772nnn/GSM772530/suppl/GSM772530_GN-990111N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM772nnn/GSM772530/suppl/GSM772530_GN-990111N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.306377	2.240569	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	0.099776	2.240573	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.028375	2.240574	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.139088	2.240640	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.009156	2.240641	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.127049	2.241258	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.179697	2.242145	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.106070	2.242149	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.044198	2.242171	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.330406	2.242172	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.035866	2.243035	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.067984	2.116370	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.292702	2.116422	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.372851	2.116434	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.127508	2.116436	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.206347	2.116499	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.046541	2.117362	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.203141	2.117370	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.161074	2.143354	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.272094	2.143355	nan	nan!sample_table_end
