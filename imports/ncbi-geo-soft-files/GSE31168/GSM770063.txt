A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770063/suppl/GSM770063_GC-052GC_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770063/suppl/GSM770063_GC-052GC_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	1.000000	1	51586	-1.518223	0.905664	nan	nanCN_473964	1.000000	1	51659	-0.434254	0.905699	nan	nanCN_473965	1.000000	1	51674	-0.366478	0.905706	nan	nanCN_473981	1.000000	1	52771	-0.837003	0.906230	nan	nanCN_473982	1.000000	1	52788	-0.973133	0.906238	nan	nanCN_497981	1.000000	1	62627	0.500273	0.910916	nan	nanCN_502615	1.000000	1	75787	-0.149766	0.917111	nan	nanCN_502613	1.000000	1	75849	0.305620	0.917140	nan	nanCN_502614	1.000000	1	76175	-1.792790	0.917292	nan	nanCN_502616	1.000000	1	76192	-1.409484	0.917300	nan	nanCN_502843	1.000000	1	88453	-0.257686	0.923003	nan	nanCN_466171	1.000000	1	218557	-0.812112	1.620683	nan	nanCN_468414	1.000000	1	218926	0.797700	1.620637	nan	nanCN_468412	1.000000	1	219009	-0.067443	1.620627	nan	nanCN_468413	1.000000	1	219024	-0.550834	1.620625	nan	nanCN_470565	1.000000	1	219470	-0.005258	1.620569	nan	nanCN_468424	1.000000	1	225521	-0.051675	1.619811	nan	nanCN_468425	1.000000	1	225579	-0.492832	1.619804	nan	nanCN_460512	1.000000	1	346294	0.037267	1.881646	nan	nanCN_460513	1.000000	1	346393	-0.135097	1.881645	nan	nan!sample_table_end
