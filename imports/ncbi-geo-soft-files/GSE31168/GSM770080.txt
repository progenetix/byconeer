A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770080/suppl/GSM770080_GC-2000169T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770080/suppl/GSM770080_GC-2000169T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.104926	2.596561	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.072117	2.596784	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.188393	2.596830	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.009882	2.600184	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.041807	2.600236	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.885811	2.630546	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.247553	2.671584	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.490849	2.671778	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.325791	2.672800	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.157677	2.672853	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.539846	2.711399	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.288456	1.914603	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.622659	1.914490	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.219382	1.914464	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.214290	1.914459	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.629686	1.914322	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.324147	1.912452	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.062099	1.912434	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.101099	1.919052	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.034839	1.919052	nan	nan!sample_table_end
