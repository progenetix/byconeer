A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771124/suppl/GSM771124_GN-980436N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771124/suppl/GSM771124_GN-980436N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_relation = Reanalyzed by: GSE85466!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.388401	1.443973	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.309061	1.444068	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.416500	1.444088	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.121728	1.445515	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.835899	1.445537	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.517835	1.458599	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.035259	1.476742	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	-0.178728	1.476830	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.173021	1.477288	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.105372	1.477312	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.026499	1.494845	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.195749	1.655166	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.123951	1.655220	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.249905	1.655232	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.424801	1.655234	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.065489	1.655299	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.026566	1.656178	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.105095	1.656187	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.382439	1.436550	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.148249	1.436550	nan	nan!sample_table_end
