A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770602/suppl/GSM770602_GC-47149013T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770602/suppl/GSM770602_GC-47149013T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.427224	2.759622	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.070645	2.759754	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	0.196319	2.759782	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.097761	2.761774	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.158511	2.761805	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.476442	2.779687	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.183767	2.803528	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.587679	2.803640	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.278188	2.804228	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.846303	2.804259	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.291449	2.826197	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.019928	2.305862	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.430249	2.305898	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.042547	2.305907	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.230580	2.305908	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.318137	2.305953	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.096896	2.306554	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.207482	2.306560	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.162073	1.582986	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.537087	1.582985	nan	nan!sample_table_end
