A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771145/suppl/GSM771145_GN-990071N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771145/suppl/GSM771145_GN-990071N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	4.000000	1	51586	1.042467	3.700628	nan	nanCN_473964	4.000000	1	51659	0.309840	3.700568	nan	nanCN_473965	4.000000	1	51674	0.293800	3.700556	nan	nanCN_473981	4.000000	1	52771	0.524586	3.699660	nan	nanCN_473982	4.000000	1	52788	0.326773	3.699646	nan	nanCN_497981	4.000000	1	62627	0.633194	3.691309	nan	nanCN_502615	4.000000	1	75787	0.374373	3.679317	nan	nanCN_502613	4.000000	1	75849	0.148322	3.679258	nan	nanCN_502614	4.000000	1	76175	0.755425	3.678949	nan	nanCN_502616	4.000000	1	76192	0.682676	3.678932	nan	nanCN_502843	4.000000	1	88453	0.291598	3.666885	nan	nanCN_466171	4.000000	1	218557	0.292103	2.574820	nan	nanCN_468414	4.000000	1	218926	-0.159164	2.574900	nan	nanCN_468412	4.000000	1	219009	0.700411	2.574918	nan	nanCN_468413	4.000000	1	219024	0.225206	2.574921	nan	nanCN_470565	4.000000	1	219470	-0.257999	2.575017	nan	nanCN_468424	4.000000	1	225521	0.238007	2.576329	nan	nanCN_468425	4.000000	1	225579	0.381533	2.576341	nan	nanCN_460512	4.000000	1	346294	1.631317	11.895401	nan	nanCN_460513	4.000000	1	346393	1.228189	11.895393	nan	nan!sample_table_end
