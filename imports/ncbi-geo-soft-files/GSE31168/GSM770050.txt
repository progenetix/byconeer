A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770050/suppl/GSM770050_GC-032TKK_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770050/suppl/GSM770050_GC-032TKK_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	3.000000	1	51586	0.226243	3.409139	nan	nanCN_473964	3.000000	1	51659	0.167246	3.409331	nan	nanCN_473965	3.000000	1	51674	0.145421	3.409370	nan	nanCN_473981	3.000000	1	52771	0.130939	3.412244	nan	nanCN_473982	3.000000	1	52788	0.419654	3.412288	nan	nanCN_497981	3.000000	1	62627	1.169706	3.437804	nan	nanCN_502615	3.000000	1	75787	0.084463	3.471026	nan	nanCN_502613	3.000000	1	75849	0.564193	3.471179	nan	nanCN_502614	3.000000	1	76175	0.429673	3.471987	nan	nanCN_502616	3.000000	1	76192	0.980393	3.472029	nan	nanCN_502843	3.000000	1	88453	0.449802	3.501744	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.444652	1.422940	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.520489	1.422806	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.200077	1.422776	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.259530	1.422770	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.446222	1.422608	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.473970	1.420404	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.612151	1.420383	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.158236	2.040761	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.125880	2.040760	nan	nan!sample_table_end
