A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771036/suppl/GSM771036_GC-990203T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771036/suppl/GSM771036_GC-990203T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	3.000000	1	51586	0.296487	3.251870	nan	nanCN_473964	3.000000	1	51659	0.351066	3.252015	nan	nanCN_473965	3.000000	1	51674	0.049217	3.252045	nan	nanCN_473981	3.000000	1	52771	0.271567	3.254225	nan	nanCN_473982	3.000000	1	52788	0.320305	3.254259	nan	nanCN_497981	3.000000	1	62627	0.629823	3.273716	nan	nanCN_502615	3.000000	1	75787	0.145517	3.299314	nan	nanCN_502613	3.000000	1	75849	0.422712	3.299433	nan	nanCN_502614	3.000000	1	76175	0.782710	3.300058	nan	nanCN_502616	3.000000	1	76192	0.714651	3.300091	nan	nanCN_502843	3.000000	1	88453	0.360817	3.323253	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.019000	1.972853	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.034620	1.972782	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.149505	1.972767	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.360072	1.972764	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.367996	1.972678	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.062922	1.971519	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.141571	1.971508	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.239513	1.742475	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.460577	1.742474	nan	nan!sample_table_end
