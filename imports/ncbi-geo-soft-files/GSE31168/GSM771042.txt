A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771042/suppl/GSM771042_GC-990396T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771042/suppl/GSM771042_GC-990396T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	3.000000	1	51586	0.457000	2.855847	nan	nanCN_473964	3.000000	1	51659	-0.134974	2.856008	nan	nanCN_473965	3.000000	1	51674	-0.157582	2.856041	nan	nanCN_473981	3.000000	1	52771	-0.064561	2.858462	nan	nanCN_473982	3.000000	1	52788	0.121958	2.858500	nan	nanCN_497981	3.000000	1	62627	1.446816	2.880067	nan	nanCN_502615	3.000000	1	75787	-0.065796	2.908401	nan	nanCN_502613	3.000000	1	75849	0.225019	2.908533	nan	nanCN_502614	3.000000	1	76175	0.456377	2.909226	nan	nanCN_502616	3.000000	1	76192	0.410309	2.909262	nan	nanCN_502843	3.000000	1	88453	0.518984	2.934976	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.189158	1.721606	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.394084	1.721765	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.567830	1.721801	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.271795	1.721807	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.255205	1.721999	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.070738	1.724612	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.227619	1.724638	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.532603	2.308821	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.302321	2.308818	nan	nan!sample_table_end
