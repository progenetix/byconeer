A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771134/suppl/GSM771134_GN-990005N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771134/suppl/GSM771134_GN-990005N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.023011	2.122600	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	0.356800	2.122418	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	0.520567	2.122381	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.400454	2.119657	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.199893	2.119615	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.500040	2.095443	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.051909	2.063960	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	-0.050035	2.063814	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.506954	2.063049	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.079367	2.063009	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	-0.068519	2.034771	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.263151	1.985177	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.133794	1.985137	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.230955	1.985128	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.145598	1.985126	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.448533	1.985078	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.159655	1.984410	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.339959	1.984404	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.501904	2.173117	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.368769	2.173115	nan	nan!sample_table_end
