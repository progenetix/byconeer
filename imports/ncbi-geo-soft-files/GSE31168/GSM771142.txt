A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771142/suppl/GSM771142_GN-990068N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771142/suppl/GSM771142_GN-990068N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_relation = Reanalyzed by: GSE85466!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.215464	1.980086	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.242662	1.980039	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	0.081172	1.980030	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.641968	1.979322	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.228892	1.979311	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.602113	1.972927	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.117087	1.964271	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.004522	1.964230	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.000261	1.964014	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.121604	1.964002	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	-0.268683	1.955820	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.349717	2.038215	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.458823	2.037999	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.059972	2.037951	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.238105	2.037942	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.518893	2.037681	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.185320	2.034128	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.422449	2.034094	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.421759	1.529332	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.008555	1.529332	nan	nan!sample_table_end
