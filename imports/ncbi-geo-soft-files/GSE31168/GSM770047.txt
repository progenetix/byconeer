A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770047/suppl/GSM770047_GC-025PHW_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770047/suppl/GSM770047_GC-025PHW_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	3.000000	1	51586	0.371672	2.978519	nan	nanCN_473964	3.000000	1	51659	-0.051157	2.978571	nan	nanCN_473965	3.000000	1	51674	0.157225	2.978581	nan	nanCN_473981	3.000000	1	52771	0.424486	2.979352	nan	nanCN_473982	3.000000	1	52788	0.289434	2.979364	nan	nanCN_497981	3.000000	1	62627	0.761842	2.986162	nan	nanCN_502615	3.000000	1	75787	0.464096	2.994896	nan	nanCN_502613	3.000000	1	75849	0.408480	2.994936	nan	nanCN_502614	3.000000	1	76175	-0.045780	2.995147	nan	nanCN_502616	3.000000	1	76192	0.347074	2.995158	nan	nanCN_502843	3.000000	1	88453	0.404001	3.002887	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.472296	1.710427	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.623708	1.710433	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.082515	1.710434	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.214542	1.710434	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.975302	1.710441	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.000275	1.710536	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.185266	1.710537	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.410195	2.638241	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.033990	2.638240	nan	nan!sample_table_end
