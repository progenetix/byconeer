A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771094/suppl/GSM771094_GN-65256293N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771094/suppl/GSM771094_GN-65256293N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.615065	1.884933	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.091693	1.885013	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	0.090619	1.885029	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.014156	1.886220	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.064825	1.886238	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.125111	1.896972	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.303115	1.911412	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	-0.007566	1.911480	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.487081	1.911837	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.437901	1.911856	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	-0.008478	1.925283	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.234420	2.058263	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.049727	2.058079	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.121356	2.058037	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.059671	2.058029	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.400375	2.057806	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.076002	2.054765	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.414756	2.054736	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.079264	1.587285	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.291401	1.587285	nan	nan!sample_table_end
