A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770543/suppl/GSM770543_GC-2000521T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770543/suppl/GSM770543_GC-2000521T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.440160	2.777285	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.210428	2.777505	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.136482	2.777550	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.012530	2.780859	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.026738	2.780910	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.798542	2.810632	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.274261	2.850335	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.247224	2.850522	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.705699	2.851502	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.479885	2.851553	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.370800	2.888187	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.091228	1.394430	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.389081	1.394316	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.259904	1.394290	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.400626	1.394285	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.669116	1.394146	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.271963	1.392259	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.748154	1.392241	nan	nanCN_460512	3.000000	1	346294	0.905389	6.210362	nan	nanCN_460513	3.000000	1	346393	0.911784	6.210362	nan	nan!sample_table_end
