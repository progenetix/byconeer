A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770924/suppl/GSM770924_GC-73291145T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770924/suppl/GSM770924_GC-73291145T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.303669	1.866310	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.160481	1.866443	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.105901	1.866471	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.977754	1.868474	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.058668	1.868505	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.924009	1.886628	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.222981	1.911247	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.458638	1.911364	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.052226	1.911978	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.625964	1.912011	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.413824	1.935275	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.121860	1.428367	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.120633	1.428465	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.616748	1.428487	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.284636	1.428491	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.906347	1.428610	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.065370	1.430230	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.141498	1.430245	nan	nanCN_460512	3.000000	1	346294	0.531398	3.185785	nan	nanCN_460513	3.000000	1	346393	0.215233	3.185783	nan	nan!sample_table_end
