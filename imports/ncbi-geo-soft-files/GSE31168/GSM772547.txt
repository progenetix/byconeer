A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM772nnn/GSM772547/suppl/GSM772547_GN-990424N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM772nnn/GSM772547/suppl/GSM772547_GN-990424N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.009967	2.060917	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.005081	2.060946	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	0.114256	2.060952	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.458763	2.061385	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.241047	2.061392	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.679129	2.065467	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.205111	2.071411	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	-0.005462	2.071440	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.326139	2.071594	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.117759	2.071602	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.003396	2.077599	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.013518	1.837556	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.224452	1.837741	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.491101	1.837783	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.216976	1.837790	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.001115	1.838014	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.023359	1.841061	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.426995	1.841090	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.037150	1.648992	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.346648	1.648992	nan	nan!sample_table_end
