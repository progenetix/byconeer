A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771035/suppl/GSM771035_GC-990172T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771035/suppl/GSM771035_GC-990172T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	3.000000	1	51586	0.333774	2.834320	nan	nanCN_473964	3.000000	1	51659	-0.105652	2.834412	nan	nanCN_473965	3.000000	1	51674	0.003817	2.834431	nan	nanCN_473981	3.000000	1	52771	0.175781	2.835823	nan	nanCN_473982	3.000000	1	52788	0.076158	2.835845	nan	nanCN_497981	3.000000	1	62627	1.483002	2.848194	nan	nanCN_502615	3.000000	1	75787	0.119578	2.864341	nan	nanCN_502613	3.000000	1	75849	0.446915	2.864416	nan	nanCN_502614	3.000000	1	76175	0.376787	2.864810	nan	nanCN_502616	3.000000	1	76192	-0.404294	2.864831	nan	nanCN_502843	3.000000	1	88453	0.611343	2.879493	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.504918	1.971458	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.056505	1.971773	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.385121	1.971844	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.319792	1.971857	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.344592	1.972239	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.209020	1.977443	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.690603	1.977493	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.456994	3.182519	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.287993	3.182519	nan	nan!sample_table_end
