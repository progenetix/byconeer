A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770044/suppl/GSM770044_GC-021LAH_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770044/suppl/GSM770044_GC-021LAH_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.043297	1.923885	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.348078	1.923982	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.593563	1.924001	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.319212	1.925444	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.028683	1.925467	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	1.102749	1.938431	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.020236	1.955813	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.052553	1.955894	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.133485	1.956326	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.521819	1.956348	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.404722	1.972567	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.281481	1.973294	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.201561	1.973252	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.166842	1.973243	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.343646	1.973241	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.368331	1.973190	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.157865	1.972497	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.019013	1.972490	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.190740	2.445469	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.131760	2.445469	nan	nan!sample_table_end
