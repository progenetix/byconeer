A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771104/suppl/GSM771104_GN-980021N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771104/suppl/GSM771104_GN-980021N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.292115	2.222889	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.049226	2.223024	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.386720	2.223052	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.436682	2.225074	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.019003	2.225105	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.622200	2.243215	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.217986	2.267236	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.273678	2.267348	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.219736	2.267938	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.520734	2.267969	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.157992	2.289948	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.642496	1.695505	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.487089	1.695423	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.233420	1.695405	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.127391	1.695402	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.320596	1.695303	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.156444	1.693958	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.403578	1.693945	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.459059	1.273748	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.264530	1.273748	nan	nan!sample_table_end
