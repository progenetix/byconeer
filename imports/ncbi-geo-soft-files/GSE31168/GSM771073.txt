A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771073/suppl/GSM771073_GN-2000201N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771073/suppl/GSM771073_GN-2000201N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.004463	2.150690	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	0.153558	2.150680	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	0.047404	2.150678	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.178079	2.150525	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.188459	2.150523	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.201828	2.148957	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.013668	2.146294	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.141132	2.146280	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.120722	2.146206	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.357331	2.146202	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	-0.140077	2.143089	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.484350	2.142056	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.307514	2.142184	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.078689	2.142213	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.388044	2.142218	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.477302	2.142373	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.230151	2.144480	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.166751	2.144500	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.942166	0.926414	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.292055	0.926415	nan	nan!sample_table_end
