A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770065/suppl/GSM770065_GC-068JW_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770065/suppl/GSM770065_GC-068JW_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	4.000000	1	51586	0.569764	3.609962	nan	nanCN_473964	4.000000	1	51659	0.117997	3.610128	nan	nanCN_473965	4.000000	1	51674	0.095104	3.610162	nan	nanCN_473981	4.000000	1	52771	0.038941	3.612659	nan	nanCN_473982	4.000000	1	52788	0.576877	3.612698	nan	nanCN_497981	4.000000	1	62627	1.284588	3.634766	nan	nanCN_502615	4.000000	1	75787	0.178842	3.663222	nan	nanCN_502613	4.000000	1	75849	0.514009	3.663352	nan	nanCN_502614	4.000000	1	76175	0.482911	3.664040	nan	nanCN_502616	4.000000	1	76192	0.894557	3.664075	nan	nanCN_502843	4.000000	1	88453	0.502876	3.689234	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.407486	2.180154	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.443366	2.180185	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.298774	2.180192	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.208864	2.180193	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.274645	2.180230	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.098646	2.180732	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.117332	2.180737	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.114308	1.677361	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.396451	1.677360	nan	nan!sample_table_end
