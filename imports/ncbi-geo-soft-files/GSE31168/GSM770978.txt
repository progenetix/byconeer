A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770978/suppl/GSM770978_GC-980011T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770978/suppl/GSM770978_GC-980011T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.428090	2.030324	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.366484	2.030468	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.248004	2.030498	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.219158	2.032662	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.301755	2.032695	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.729307	2.052304	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.528980	2.079043	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.328710	2.079170	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.112519	2.079839	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.104500	2.079875	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.470394	2.105257	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.101060	3.023600	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	1.391624	3.022981	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.411528	3.022842	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.575666	3.022816	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.369766	3.022068	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.188176	3.011888	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.353231	3.011791	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.740626	2.977012	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.102696	2.977009	nan	nan!sample_table_end
