A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771091/suppl/GSM771091_GN-57701999N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771091/suppl/GSM771091_GN-57701999N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.321294	1.596847	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.300266	1.596888	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.323537	1.596897	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.021661	1.597517	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.109592	1.597527	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.313048	1.603246	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.040779	1.611316	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	-0.064405	1.611355	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.171115	1.611561	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.346730	1.611572	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.044278	1.619519	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.245558	1.983456	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.002591	1.983401	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.037346	1.983389	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.088545	1.983386	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.091673	1.983319	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.155939	1.982410	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.002673	1.982402	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.030741	2.041857	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.063959	2.041857	nan	nan!sample_table_end
