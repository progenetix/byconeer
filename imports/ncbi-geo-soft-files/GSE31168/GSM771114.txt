A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771114/suppl/GSM771114_GN-980390N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771114/suppl/GSM771114_GN-980390N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.385577	2.268950	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	0.083319	2.268928	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	0.185262	2.268923	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.036328	2.268590	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.255085	2.268584	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.554274	2.265755	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.434985	2.262423	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	-0.076592	2.262408	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.143154	2.262332	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.191283	2.262328	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.027753	2.259690	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.042082	1.916830	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.422129	1.916875	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.042013	1.916885	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.010705	1.916887	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.136132	1.916942	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.096418	1.917691	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.036951	1.917698	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.118120	3.030636	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.548443	3.030638	nan	nan!sample_table_end
