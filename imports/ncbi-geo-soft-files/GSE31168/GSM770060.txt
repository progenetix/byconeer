A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770060/suppl/GSM770060_GC-047LAK_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770060/suppl/GSM770060_GC-047LAK_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	4.000000	1	51586	0.612792	3.818114	nan	nanCN_473964	4.000000	1	51659	0.199798	3.818303	nan	nanCN_473965	4.000000	1	51674	0.140141	3.818342	nan	nanCN_473981	4.000000	1	52771	0.798239	3.821183	nan	nanCN_473982	4.000000	1	52788	0.113574	3.821227	nan	nanCN_497981	4.000000	1	62627	0.796571	3.846602	nan	nanCN_502615	4.000000	1	75787	0.550316	3.880081	nan	nanCN_502613	4.000000	1	75849	0.497129	3.880237	nan	nanCN_502614	4.000000	1	76175	0.727669	3.881057	nan	nanCN_502616	4.000000	1	76192	0.815939	3.881099	nan	nanCN_502843	4.000000	1	88453	0.516404	3.911510	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.031058	1.846140	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.169500	1.846105	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.058632	1.846097	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.218949	1.846095	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.180447	1.846053	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.018944	1.845477	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.248607	1.845471	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.311652	2.409909	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.012645	2.409908	nan	nan!sample_table_end
