A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771001/suppl/GSM771001_GC-980369T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771001/suppl/GSM771001_GC-980369T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.309749	2.521627	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.114971	2.521607	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	0.101665	2.521602	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.146714	2.521298	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.367812	2.521293	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.822026	2.518624	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.015677	2.515328	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.321430	2.515314	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.424494	2.515238	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.014395	2.515234	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.512414	2.512602	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.033201	2.551476	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.787926	2.551483	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.120585	2.551484	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.028220	2.551485	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.022843	2.551493	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.295671	2.551613	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.124424	2.551615	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.436179	1.741250	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.658370	1.741248	nan	nan!sample_table_end
