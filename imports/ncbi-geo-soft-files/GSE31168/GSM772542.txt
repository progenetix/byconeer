A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM772nnn/GSM772542/suppl/GSM772542_GN-990339N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM772nnn/GSM772542/suppl/GSM772542_GN-990339N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	1.000000	1	51586	-0.619431	1.294294	nan	nanCN_473964	1.000000	1	51659	-0.040326	1.294435	nan	nanCN_473965	1.000000	1	51674	-0.594610	1.294464	nan	nanCN_473981	1.000000	1	52771	-1.043687	1.296589	nan	nanCN_473982	1.000000	1	52788	-0.723627	1.296622	nan	nanCN_497981	1.000000	1	62627	-0.314109	1.315904	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.061155	1.342198	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.368571	1.342322	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.306267	1.342980	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.133378	1.343014	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	-0.191629	1.367854	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.065630	1.468764	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.528522	1.468839	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.415452	1.468856	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.196094	1.468859	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.495855	1.468950	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.070061	1.470191	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.089359	1.470203	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.120024	1.785159	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.302275	1.785158	nan	nan!sample_table_end
