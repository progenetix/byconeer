A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770597/suppl/GSM770597_GC-31231321T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770597/suppl/GSM770597_GC-31231321T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.096338	2.486711	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.006848	2.486800	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.259409	2.486818	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.159516	2.488151	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.342064	2.488172	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.549705	2.500143	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.424707	2.516139	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.274259	2.516214	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.358734	2.516609	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.561650	2.516630	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.324647	2.531443	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.242091	1.848594	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.042101	1.848626	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.440054	1.848634	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.320258	1.848635	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.005790	1.848674	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.195190	1.849209	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.152363	1.849214	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.293222	1.376694	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.305721	1.376694	nan	nan!sample_table_end
