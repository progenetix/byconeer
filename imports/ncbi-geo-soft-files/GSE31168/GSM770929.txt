A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770929/suppl/GSM770929_GC-77263387T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770929/suppl/GSM770929_GC-77263387T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.149980	1.854902	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.003596	1.854957	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	0.126670	1.854968	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.086824	1.855803	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.263968	1.855816	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.784365	1.863611	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.328343	1.874876	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	-0.128470	1.874931	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.037983	1.875222	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.076110	1.875237	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.090842	1.886562	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.197548	1.648412	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.243968	1.648489	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.145815	1.648507	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.368409	1.648510	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.084345	1.648604	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.043928	1.649882	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.086468	1.649894	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.236157	2.195114	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.086869	2.195113	nan	nan!sample_table_end
