A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770563/suppl/GSM770563_GC-2001190T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770563/suppl/GSM770563_GC-2001190T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	3.000000	1	51586	0.558951	3.538720	nan	nanCN_473964	3.000000	1	51659	0.015819	3.538868	nan	nanCN_473965	3.000000	1	51674	0.063807	3.538899	nan	nanCN_473981	3.000000	1	52771	-0.184081	3.541120	nan	nanCN_473982	3.000000	1	52788	0.870035	3.541154	nan	nanCN_497981	3.000000	1	62627	1.584182	3.560995	nan	nanCN_502615	3.000000	1	75787	0.239775	3.587279	nan	nanCN_502613	3.000000	1	75849	0.573862	3.587402	nan	nanCN_502614	3.000000	1	76175	0.442836	3.588049	nan	nanCN_502616	3.000000	1	76192	0.116047	3.588083	nan	nanCN_502843	3.000000	1	88453	0.811540	3.612275	nan	nanCN_466171	3.000000	1	218557	-0.141044	2.543985	nan	nanCN_468414	3.000000	1	218926	0.295786	2.543869	nan	nanCN_468412	3.000000	1	219009	0.361792	2.543843	nan	nanCN_468413	3.000000	1	219024	0.372484	2.543839	nan	nanCN_470565	3.000000	1	219470	0.377139	2.543699	nan	nanCN_468424	3.000000	1	225521	-0.335029	2.541796	nan	nanCN_468425	3.000000	1	225579	0.416455	2.541778	nan	nanCN_460512	3.000000	1	346294	0.139997	3.013359	nan	nanCN_460513	3.000000	1	346393	0.517397	3.013361	nan	nan!sample_table_end
