A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770592/suppl/GSM770592_GC-20021007T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770592/suppl/GSM770592_GC-20021007T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_relation = Reanalyzed by: GSE85466!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	4.000000	1	51586	1.030664	4.419314	nan	nanCN_473964	4.000000	1	51659	0.025522	4.419396	nan	nanCN_473965	4.000000	1	51674	0.311935	4.419413	nan	nanCN_473981	4.000000	1	52771	0.174634	4.420638	nan	nanCN_473982	4.000000	1	52788	0.914653	4.420657	nan	nanCN_497981	4.000000	1	62627	1.667349	4.431220	nan	nanCN_502615	4.000000	1	75787	-0.160290	4.444139	nan	nanCN_502613	4.000000	1	75849	1.072625	4.444196	nan	nanCN_502614	4.000000	1	76175	0.715087	4.444498	nan	nanCN_502616	4.000000	1	76192	0.477765	4.444514	nan	nanCN_502843	4.000000	1	88453	0.772235	4.455273	nan	nanCN_466171	3.000000	1	218557	-0.100544	1.757609	nan	nanCN_468414	3.000000	1	218926	-0.350968	1.757749	nan	nanCN_468412	3.000000	1	219009	-0.931038	1.757780	nan	nanCN_468413	3.000000	1	219024	0.956412	1.757786	nan	nanCN_470565	3.000000	1	219470	-0.580169	1.757955	nan	nanCN_468424	3.000000	1	225521	0.082605	1.760258	nan	nanCN_468425	3.000000	1	225579	0.203258	1.760280	nan	nanCN_460512	3.000000	1	346294	0.772489	3.500690	nan	nanCN_460513	3.000000	1	346393	0.125314	3.500687	nan	nan!sample_table_end
