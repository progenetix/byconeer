A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770557/suppl/GSM770557_GC-2000963T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770557/suppl/GSM770557_GC-2000963T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	3.000000	1	51586	0.560165	3.820859	nan	nanCN_473964	3.000000	1	51659	-0.165257	3.820980	nan	nanCN_473965	3.000000	1	51674	0.285231	3.821005	nan	nanCN_473981	3.000000	1	52771	0.559586	3.822824	nan	nanCN_473982	3.000000	1	52788	0.647859	3.822853	nan	nanCN_497981	3.000000	1	62627	1.250965	3.838902	nan	nanCN_502615	3.000000	1	75787	0.139690	3.859541	nan	nanCN_502613	3.000000	1	75849	0.436258	3.859636	nan	nanCN_502614	3.000000	1	76175	0.788699	3.860134	nan	nanCN_502616	3.000000	1	76192	0.618658	3.860160	nan	nanCN_502843	3.000000	1	88453	0.620837	3.878410	nan	nanCN_466171	3.000000	1	218557	0.094349	2.373772	nan	nanCN_468414	3.000000	1	218926	0.402802	2.373599	nan	nanCN_468412	3.000000	1	219009	-0.056261	2.373559	nan	nanCN_468413	3.000000	1	219024	0.883409	2.373553	nan	nanCN_470565	3.000000	1	219470	-0.239210	2.373343	nan	nanCN_468424	3.000000	1	225521	-0.028585	2.370489	nan	nanCN_468425	3.000000	1	225579	-0.098735	2.370462	nan	nanCN_460512	3.000000	1	346294	0.085109	1.956210	nan	nanCN_460513	3.000000	1	346393	-0.120614	1.956210	nan	nan!sample_table_end
