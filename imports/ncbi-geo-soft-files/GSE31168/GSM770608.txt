A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770608/suppl/GSM770608_GC-57701999T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770608/suppl/GSM770608_GC-57701999T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	3.000000	1	51586	0.696783	3.061301	nan	nanCN_473964	3.000000	1	51659	0.051784	3.061398	nan	nanCN_473965	3.000000	1	51674	-0.143753	3.061418	nan	nanCN_473981	3.000000	1	52771	0.155672	3.062881	nan	nanCN_473982	3.000000	1	52788	0.250309	3.062904	nan	nanCN_497981	3.000000	1	62627	1.234220	3.076138	nan	nanCN_502615	3.000000	1	75787	0.072420	3.094189	nan	nanCN_502613	3.000000	1	75849	0.453311	3.094275	nan	nanCN_502614	3.000000	1	76175	0.087293	3.094728	nan	nanCN_502616	3.000000	1	76192	0.187125	3.094751	nan	nanCN_502843	3.000000	1	88453	0.769166	3.111989	nan	nanCN_466171	3.000000	1	218557	0.002843	3.027259	nan	nanCN_468414	3.000000	1	218926	0.731394	3.027074	nan	nanCN_468412	3.000000	1	219009	0.635829	3.027032	nan	nanCN_468413	3.000000	1	219024	0.908132	3.027025	nan	nanCN_470565	3.000000	1	219470	-0.285620	3.026801	nan	nanCN_468424	3.000000	1	225521	0.059639	3.023757	nan	nanCN_468425	3.000000	1	225579	0.271204	3.023728	nan	nanCN_460512	3.000000	1	346294	0.709896	4.336274	nan	nanCN_460513	3.000000	1	346393	0.531201	4.336273	nan	nan!sample_table_end
