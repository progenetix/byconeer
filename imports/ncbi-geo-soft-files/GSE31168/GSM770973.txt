A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770973/suppl/GSM770973_GC-970017T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770973/suppl/GSM770973_GC-970017T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.067275	2.576984	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	0.010523	2.577096	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	0.068297	2.577118	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.225311	2.578792	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.254890	2.578817	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.881708	2.593708	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.272582	2.613217	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.725978	2.613307	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.143477	2.613783	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.615247	2.613808	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.307176	2.631426	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.218907	1.657616	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.682142	1.657418	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.145722	1.657373	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.150543	1.657365	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.563275	1.657125	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.174045	1.653859	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.791245	1.653828	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.096890	1.591777	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.463022	1.591776	nan	nan!sample_table_end
