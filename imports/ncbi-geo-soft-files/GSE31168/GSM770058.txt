A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770058/suppl/GSM770058_GC-045TSL_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770058/suppl/GSM770058_GC-045TSL_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.025610	2.554799	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.130043	2.554776	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	0.101970	2.554771	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.471010	2.554422	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.406340	2.554416	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.849571	2.551290	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.381475	2.547225	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.106792	2.547207	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.153930	2.547109	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.064333	2.547104	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.481566	2.543593	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.250603	2.067383	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.064916	2.067336	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.085126	2.067326	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.529869	2.067323	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.593817	2.067267	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.080529	2.066496	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.102219	2.066489	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.369572	2.838184	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.191771	2.838183	nan	nan!sample_table_end
