A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771040/suppl/GSM771040_GC-990339T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771040/suppl/GSM771040_GC-990339T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.504270	2.084526	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.419110	2.084805	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.216602	2.084863	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.474536	2.089066	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.086012	2.089131	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.710225	2.127117	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.160365	2.178494	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.678540	2.178737	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.174896	2.180015	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.296833	2.180082	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.242748	2.228170	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.252822	1.427926	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.153634	1.427941	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.036643	1.427945	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.015279	1.427945	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-1.009882	1.427964	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.111516	1.428218	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.310394	1.428221	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.322994	2.031975	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.348432	2.031977	nan	nan!sample_table_end
