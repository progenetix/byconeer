A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771080/suppl/GSM771080_GN-2000403N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771080/suppl/GSM771080_GN-2000403N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.337925	1.549797	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.361880	1.549829	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	0.010712	1.549836	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.125800	1.550319	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.162301	1.550327	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.722894	1.554775	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.069786	1.561011	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	-0.367591	1.561041	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.078144	1.561199	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.077766	1.561207	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	-0.204985	1.567263	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.323651	2.292023	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.147688	2.292022	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.194830	2.292021	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.043125	2.292021	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.126609	2.292019	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.052115	2.291993	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.172425	2.291993	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.004256	2.147814	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.110097	2.147814	nan	nan!sample_table_end
