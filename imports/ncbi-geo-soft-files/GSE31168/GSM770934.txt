A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770934/suppl/GSM770934_GC-87622942T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770934/suppl/GSM770934_GC-87622942T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.412662	2.110067	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.058524	2.110304	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.254929	2.110353	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.611732	2.113921	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-1.067131	2.113976	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	1.062106	2.146237	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.626721	2.189965	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.463455	2.190172	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.330977	2.191261	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.618743	2.191318	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.378761	2.232399	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.212282	2.355894	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.712666	2.355824	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.390259	2.355808	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.001799	2.355805	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.060275	2.355721	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.019505	2.354564	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.065878	2.354553	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.011485	1.836901	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.147912	1.836901	nan	nan!sample_table_end
