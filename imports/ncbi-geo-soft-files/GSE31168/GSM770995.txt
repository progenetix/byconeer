A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770995/suppl/GSM770995_GC-980255T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770995/suppl/GSM770995_GC-980255T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	1.000000	1	51586	-0.059256	1.116702	nan	nanCN_473964	1.000000	1	51659	-0.486186	1.116611	nan	nanCN_473965	1.000000	1	51674	-0.434187	1.116592	nan	nanCN_473981	1.000000	1	52771	-1.136623	1.115225	nan	nanCN_473982	1.000000	1	52788	0.400901	1.115204	nan	nanCN_497981	1.000000	1	62627	0.738760	1.103183	nan	nanCN_502615	1.000000	1	75787	-1.251441	1.087916	nan	nanCN_502613	1.000000	1	75849	-0.026081	1.087847	nan	nanCN_502614	1.000000	1	76175	-1.153420	1.087482	nan	nanCN_502616	1.000000	1	76192	-2.182796	1.087463	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.365904	1.074325	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.174513	2.292702	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.599174	2.292303	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.345644	2.292213	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.687176	2.292197	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.285198	2.291714	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.505243	2.285151	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.258969	2.285088	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	1.706284	11.690166	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	1.125311	11.690160	nan	nan!sample_table_end
