A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770040/suppl/GSM770040_GC-007LKB_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770040/suppl/GSM770040_GC-007LKB_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.398205	1.734268	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.333629	1.734334	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.142067	1.734347	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.161439	1.735332	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.420365	1.735348	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.846839	1.744107	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.257092	1.755586	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.166373	1.755639	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.427744	1.755919	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.729644	1.755934	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.133748	1.766345	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.865355	2.188516	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.849062	2.188580	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.366342	2.188594	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.177612	2.188597	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.075077	2.188674	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.067462	2.189728	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.326731	2.189738	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.025011	1.880028	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.124220	1.880027	nan	nan!sample_table_end
