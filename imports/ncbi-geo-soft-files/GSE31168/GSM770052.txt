A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770052/suppl/GSM770052_GC-035PCC_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770052/suppl/GSM770052_GC-035PCC_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.391605	2.118739	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	0.242975	2.118730	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	0.228937	2.118728	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.635797	2.118594	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.114738	2.118593	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.601608	2.117476	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.290317	2.116185	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.099087	2.116179	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.289215	2.116150	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.503951	2.116149	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	-0.093081	2.115126	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.016628	2.136513	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.329031	2.136462	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.039877	2.136451	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.427091	2.136449	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.593175	2.136387	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.183620	2.135551	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.253278	2.135543	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.145573	1.344518	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.491299	1.344517	nan	nan!sample_table_end
