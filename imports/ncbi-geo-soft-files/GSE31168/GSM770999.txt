A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770999/suppl/GSM770999_GC-980319T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770999/suppl/GSM770999_GC-980319T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_relation = Reanalyzed by: GSE85466!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	3.000000	1	51586	0.754733	3.099368	nan	nanCN_473964	3.000000	1	51659	-0.154705	3.099671	nan	nanCN_473965	3.000000	1	51674	-0.273997	3.099733	nan	nanCN_473981	3.000000	1	52771	-0.271133	3.104292	nan	nanCN_473982	3.000000	1	52788	0.349226	3.104363	nan	nanCN_497981	3.000000	1	62627	1.012332	3.145715	nan	nanCN_502615	3.000000	1	75787	-0.056980	3.202170	nan	nanCN_502613	3.000000	1	75849	0.710629	3.202438	nan	nanCN_502614	3.000000	1	76175	0.664998	3.203851	nan	nanCN_502616	3.000000	1	76192	0.525840	3.203925	nan	nanCN_502843	3.000000	1	88453	0.768431	3.257468	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.282115	2.337748	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.555512	2.337898	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.116680	2.337931	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.252106	2.337937	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.150002	2.338118	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.223437	2.340585	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.397204	2.340608	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.169285	2.362197	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.097652	2.362197	nan	nan!sample_table_end
