A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771031/suppl/GSM771031_GC-990090T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771031/suppl/GSM771031_GC-990090T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.257799	1.717222	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.237543	1.717343	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.160859	1.717368	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.509742	1.719194	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.021142	1.719222	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.479965	1.735855	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.101896	1.758755	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	-0.210468	1.758864	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.401264	1.759440	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.128224	1.759470	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.032920	1.781347	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.070435	2.198974	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.501164	2.198896	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.457795	2.198878	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.014501	2.198875	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.590073	2.198780	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.061732	2.197482	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.039921	2.197469	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	1.338668	6.487436	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.548505	6.487430	nan	nan!sample_table_end
