A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770921/suppl/GSM770921_GC-66811693T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770921/suppl/GSM770921_GC-66811693T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	4.000000	1	51586	1.143025	5.228673	nan	nanCN_473964	4.000000	1	51659	0.359219	5.228631	nan	nanCN_473965	4.000000	1	51674	0.489509	5.228623	nan	nanCN_473981	4.000000	1	52771	0.912733	5.227998	nan	nanCN_473982	4.000000	1	52788	0.682872	5.227989	nan	nanCN_497981	4.000000	1	62627	1.443267	5.221869	nan	nanCN_502615	4.000000	1	75787	0.054540	5.212296	nan	nanCN_502613	4.000000	1	75849	0.579782	5.212248	nan	nanCN_502614	4.000000	1	76175	0.936243	5.211991	nan	nanCN_502616	4.000000	1	76192	1.090608	5.211977	nan	nanCN_502843	4.000000	1	88453	0.751669	5.201704	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.033245	2.107462	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.235558	2.107453	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.079167	2.107451	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.700740	2.107451	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.880657	2.107441	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.066642	2.107302	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.059373	2.107301	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.505892	3.213692	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.254727	3.213691	nan	nan!sample_table_end
