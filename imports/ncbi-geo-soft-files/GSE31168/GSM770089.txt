A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770089/suppl/GSM770089_GC-2000346T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770089/suppl/GSM770089_GC-2000346T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	3.000000	1	51586	0.330186	3.282792	nan	nanCN_473964	3.000000	1	51659	-0.008721	3.282961	nan	nanCN_473965	3.000000	1	51674	0.155087	3.282995	nan	nanCN_473981	3.000000	1	52771	0.494735	3.285532	nan	nanCN_473982	3.000000	1	52788	0.230758	3.285572	nan	nanCN_497981	3.000000	1	62627	0.929882	3.308428	nan	nanCN_502615	3.000000	1	75787	0.016048	3.339200	nan	nanCN_502613	3.000000	1	75849	0.570010	3.339345	nan	nanCN_502614	3.000000	1	76175	0.582051	3.340109	nan	nanCN_502616	3.000000	1	76192	0.508447	3.340149	nan	nanCN_502843	3.000000	1	88453	0.645059	3.368898	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.336875	2.082208	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.891943	2.082234	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.446510	2.082239	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.124167	2.082241	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.835259	2.082272	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.129890	2.082700	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.055120	2.082705	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.022567	2.007525	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.028590	2.007525	nan	nan!sample_table_end
