A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770919/suppl/GSM770919_GC-6412929T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770919/suppl/GSM770919_GC-6412929T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.348948	2.250228	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.328946	2.250360	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.357211	2.250386	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.117223	2.252366	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.065363	2.252397	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.936818	2.270275	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.213508	2.294493	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.358758	2.294608	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.371756	2.295212	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.291103	2.295243	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.495376	2.318065	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.490747	1.768102	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.249211	1.768159	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.461981	1.768172	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.087843	1.768174	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.038725	1.768243	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.104609	1.769179	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.140407	1.769188	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.143905	1.984226	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.131206	1.984227	nan	nan!sample_table_end
