A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771098/suppl/GSM771098_GN-87622942N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771098/suppl/GSM771098_GN-87622942N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.573472	1.496454	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.165949	1.496486	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.393388	1.496493	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.124480	1.496969	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.278298	1.496977	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.437664	1.501282	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.233722	1.507085	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	-0.436316	1.507113	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.074285	1.507257	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.286726	1.507264	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	-0.235241	1.512670	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.021781	2.084544	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.116784	2.084490	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.028384	2.084477	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.334662	2.084475	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.630094	2.084409	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.010246	2.083502	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.141749	2.083493	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.215567	1.681795	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.493476	1.681793	nan	nan!sample_table_end
