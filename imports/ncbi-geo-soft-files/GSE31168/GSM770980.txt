A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770980/suppl/GSM770980_GC-980025T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770980/suppl/GSM770980_GC-980025T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.062146	2.713333	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.073212	2.713491	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	0.008147	2.713524	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.250430	2.715899	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.013821	2.715936	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	1.078224	2.737411	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.414508	2.766574	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.371183	2.766713	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.520608	2.767441	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.308016	2.767479	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.665879	2.795052	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.048737	2.408123	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.193124	2.407982	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.201692	2.407950	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.386355	2.407945	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.268448	2.407774	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.016929	2.405457	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.076371	2.405434	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.655740	1.428477	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.116015	1.428479	nan	nan!sample_table_end
