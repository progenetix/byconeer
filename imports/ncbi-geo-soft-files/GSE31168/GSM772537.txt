A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM772nnn/GSM772537/suppl/GSM772537_GN-990205N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM772nnn/GSM772537/suppl/GSM772537_GN-990205N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.381498	1.580494	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	0.221162	1.580455	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	0.060828	1.580447	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.313505	1.579856	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.331656	1.579847	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.150959	1.574482	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.055490	1.567157	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.223071	1.567122	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.609327	1.566939	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.472543	1.566929	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	-0.315721	1.559982	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.179941	1.599102	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.366175	1.599142	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.262814	1.599151	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.300985	1.599153	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.325796	1.599202	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.178416	1.599870	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.000289	1.599876	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.266728	1.516718	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.176869	1.516718	nan	nan!sample_table_end
