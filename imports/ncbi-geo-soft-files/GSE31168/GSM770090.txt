A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770090/suppl/GSM770090_GC-2000362T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770090/suppl/GSM770090_GC-2000362T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.076797	2.725310	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.286659	2.725582	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	0.092891	2.725638	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.278878	2.729742	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.247454	2.729805	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.849261	2.767071	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.108272	2.818081	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.517384	2.818324	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.310047	2.819602	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.501029	2.819669	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.701593	2.868206	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.365937	1.889764	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.196660	1.889806	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.175918	1.889816	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.343104	1.889817	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.358269	1.889868	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.177956	1.890564	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.134586	1.890571	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.778626	0.778917	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.733714	0.778917	nan	nan!sample_table_end
