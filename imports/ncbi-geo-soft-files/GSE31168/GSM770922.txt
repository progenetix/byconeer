A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770922/suppl/GSM770922_GC-68334421T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770922/suppl/GSM770922_GC-68334421T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	4.000000	1	51586	0.627213	4.038488	nan	nanCN_473964	4.000000	1	51659	-0.073148	4.038445	nan	nanCN_473965	4.000000	1	51674	0.115462	4.038436	nan	nanCN_473981	4.000000	1	52771	0.588247	4.037791	nan	nanCN_473982	4.000000	1	52788	1.252138	4.037781	nan	nanCN_497981	4.000000	1	62627	1.558002	4.031605	nan	nanCN_502615	4.000000	1	75787	0.182342	4.022390	nan	nanCN_502613	4.000000	1	75849	0.139835	4.022345	nan	nanCN_502614	4.000000	1	76175	0.709151	4.022104	nan	nanCN_502616	4.000000	1	76192	0.332347	4.022091	nan	nanCN_502843	4.000000	1	88453	0.732264	4.012724	nan	nanCN_466171	4.000000	1	218557	-0.122040	3.122553	nan	nanCN_468414	4.000000	1	218926	0.945689	3.122153	nan	nanCN_468412	4.000000	1	219009	0.897316	3.122063	nan	nanCN_468413	4.000000	1	219024	0.750010	3.122047	nan	nanCN_470565	4.000000	1	219470	0.063272	3.121563	nan	nanCN_468424	4.000000	1	225521	0.018938	3.114984	nan	nanCN_468425	4.000000	1	225579	-0.059857	3.114921	nan	nanCN_460512	4.000000	1	346294	0.113379	2.486361	nan	nanCN_460513	4.000000	1	346393	0.235716	2.486362	nan	nan!sample_table_end
