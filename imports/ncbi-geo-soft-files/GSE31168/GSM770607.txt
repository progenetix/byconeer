A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770607/suppl/GSM770607_GC-57689477T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770607/suppl/GSM770607_GC-57689477T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.101099	1.343180	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.380063	1.343054	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.384668	1.343028	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.426824	1.341134	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.072363	1.341105	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	1.070109	1.324277	nan	nanCN_502615	1.000000	1	75787	-0.557076	1.302398	nan	nanCN_502613	1.000000	1	75849	-0.766935	1.302297	nan	nanCN_502614	1.000000	1	76175	-1.226589	1.301767	nan	nanCN_502616	1.000000	1	76192	-1.413827	1.301739	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.270576	1.282296	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.074584	2.055707	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.216994	2.055799	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.039813	2.055819	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.676913	2.055823	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.777747	2.055934	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.052760	2.057451	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.307869	2.057466	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	1.833550	12.095233	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	1.052674	12.095222	nan	nan!sample_table_end
