A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771133/suppl/GSM771133_GN-980447N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771133/suppl/GSM771133_GN-980447N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_relation = Reanalyzed by: GSE85466!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.097855	1.815059	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.117442	1.815033	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	0.089084	1.815028	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.025330	1.814633	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.051575	1.814627	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.095251	1.811189	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.233141	1.806919	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	-0.129258	1.806900	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.269207	1.806799	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.041428	1.806794	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.055753	1.803229	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.013843	2.168799	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.082757	2.168898	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.176641	2.168921	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.192702	2.168925	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.025317	2.169044	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.179309	2.170675	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.218438	2.170691	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.053472	1.644014	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.260875	1.644013	nan	nan!sample_table_end
