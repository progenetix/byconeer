A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771095/suppl/GSM771095_GN-66811693N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771095/suppl/GSM771095_GN-66811693N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	3.000000	1	51586	0.630327	2.920708	nan	nanCN_473964	3.000000	1	51659	0.165354	2.920370	nan	nanCN_473965	3.000000	1	51674	0.274071	2.920300	nan	nanCN_473981	3.000000	1	52771	0.556496	2.915203	nan	nanCN_473982	3.000000	1	52788	0.551607	2.915124	nan	nanCN_497981	3.000000	1	62627	0.717603	2.868328	nan	nanCN_502615	3.000000	1	75787	-0.001084	2.802910	nan	nanCN_502613	3.000000	1	75849	0.177711	2.802595	nan	nanCN_502614	3.000000	1	76175	0.314292	2.800936	nan	nanCN_502616	3.000000	1	76192	0.606126	2.800849	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	-0.953347	2.737254	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.012332	1.968661	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.398650	1.968569	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.080600	1.968548	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.314107	1.968545	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.446644	1.968433	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.231413	1.966922	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.032779	1.966907	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.043580	1.700684	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.303576	1.700683	nan	nan!sample_table_end
