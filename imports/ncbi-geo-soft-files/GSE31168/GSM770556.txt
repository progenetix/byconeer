A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770556/suppl/GSM770556_GC-2000887T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770556/suppl/GSM770556_GC-2000887T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.076418	2.011842	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.562097	2.012142	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.526215	2.012204	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.754774	2.016722	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.028146	2.016793	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.511783	2.058127	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.144113	2.115558	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.241986	2.115834	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.346812	2.117287	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.109763	2.117363	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.708305	2.172950	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.031482	1.502156	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-1.166587	1.502299	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.494671	1.502331	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.664669	1.502337	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.704140	1.502510	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.079967	1.504866	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.051168	1.504888	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.444847	2.900652	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.151412	2.900651	nan	nan!sample_table_end
