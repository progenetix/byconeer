A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770970/suppl/GSM770970_GC-970001T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770970/suppl/GSM770970_GC-970001T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.594130	2.041433	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	0.079495	2.041528	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.060424	2.041547	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.245522	2.042973	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.012916	2.042995	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.117648	2.055936	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.326942	2.073622	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.031297	2.073707	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.081727	2.074149	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.096343	2.074172	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.163084	2.090947	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.093973	1.702450	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.166612	1.702574	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.831945	1.702602	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.053334	1.702607	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.123268	1.702757	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.000816	1.704799	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.180477	1.704819	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.274295	1.506667	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.179965	1.506667	nan	nan!sample_table_end
