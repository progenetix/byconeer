A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771137/suppl/GSM771137_GN-990024N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771137/suppl/GSM771137_GN-990024N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.102340	2.161104	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	0.398273	2.161078	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	0.156311	2.161073	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.507479	2.160691	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.184898	2.160686	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.673497	2.157342	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.550840	2.153078	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.274105	2.153059	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.190769	2.152956	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.052143	2.152950	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	-0.116958	2.149166	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.039021	1.457301	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.192116	1.457165	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.278008	1.457135	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.184095	1.457129	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.129183	1.456966	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.369597	1.454740	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.668087	1.454719	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.524072	1.641569	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.207340	1.641570	nan	nan!sample_table_end
