A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770086/suppl/GSM770086_GC-2000256T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770086/suppl/GSM770086_GC-2000256T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	3.000000	1	51586	0.651134	3.761378	nan	nanCN_473964	3.000000	1	51659	0.113791	3.761491	nan	nanCN_473965	3.000000	1	51674	0.280214	3.761514	nan	nanCN_473981	3.000000	1	52771	0.441654	3.763209	nan	nanCN_473982	3.000000	1	52788	0.521098	3.763236	nan	nanCN_497981	3.000000	1	62627	0.884094	3.778341	nan	nanCN_502615	3.000000	1	75787	0.396686	3.798196	nan	nanCN_502613	3.000000	1	75849	0.843355	3.798289	nan	nanCN_502614	3.000000	1	76175	0.420394	3.798774	nan	nanCN_502616	3.000000	1	76192	0.473172	3.798800	nan	nanCN_502843	3.000000	1	88453	0.585414	3.816808	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.264946	2.212197	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.636906	2.212222	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.412319	2.212227	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.098357	2.212228	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.573795	2.212259	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.184999	2.212673	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.073031	2.212677	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.600823	2.892159	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.009268	2.892156	nan	nan!sample_table_end
