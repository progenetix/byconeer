A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770043/suppl/GSM770043_GC-017TPC_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770043/suppl/GSM770043_GC-017TPC_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	1.000000	1	51586	-0.988048	0.941224	nan	nanCN_473964	1.000000	1	51659	-0.382730	0.941234	nan	nanCN_473965	1.000000	1	51674	-0.764160	0.941236	nan	nanCN_473981	1.000000	1	52771	-1.109242	0.941394	nan	nanCN_473982	1.000000	1	52788	-0.241729	0.941396	nan	nanCN_497981	1.000000	1	62627	0.401030	0.942862	nan	nanCN_502615	1.000000	1	75787	-0.028890	0.945022	nan	nanCN_502613	1.000000	1	75849	-0.292956	0.945033	nan	nanCN_502614	1.000000	1	76175	-1.103810	0.945090	nan	nanCN_502616	1.000000	1	76192	-2.082929	0.945092	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	-0.018532	0.947378	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.311167	2.437060	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	1.088762	2.436935	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.685809	2.436906	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.566069	2.436901	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.216732	2.436749	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.023012	2.434680	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.030807	2.434660	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.703851	4.220528	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.493856	4.220527	nan	nan!sample_table_end
