A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770593/suppl/GSM770593_GC-20263644T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770593/suppl/GSM770593_GC-20263644T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	3.000000	1	51586	0.405002	3.491281	nan	nanCN_473964	3.000000	1	51659	0.059858	3.491424	nan	nanCN_473965	3.000000	1	51674	0.189334	3.491453	nan	nanCN_473981	3.000000	1	52771	0.337898	3.493607	nan	nanCN_473982	3.000000	1	52788	0.475155	3.493640	nan	nanCN_497981	3.000000	1	62627	1.212278	3.512996	nan	nanCN_502615	3.000000	1	75787	0.135668	3.538972	nan	nanCN_502613	3.000000	1	75849	0.344648	3.539094	nan	nanCN_502614	3.000000	1	76175	0.552570	3.539739	nan	nanCN_502616	3.000000	1	76192	0.513172	3.539772	nan	nanCN_502843	3.000000	1	88453	0.754067	3.564013	nan	nanCN_466171	3.000000	1	218557	-0.285627	2.050521	nan	nanCN_468414	3.000000	1	218926	0.674290	2.050265	nan	nanCN_468412	3.000000	1	219009	0.329428	2.050208	nan	nanCN_468413	3.000000	1	219024	0.338941	2.050197	nan	nanCN_470565	3.000000	1	219470	-0.238374	2.049888	nan	nanCN_468424	3.000000	1	225521	-0.442746	2.045685	nan	nanCN_468425	3.000000	1	225579	-0.242929	2.045645	nan	nanCN_460512	3.000000	1	346294	0.042699	1.780897	nan	nanCN_460513	3.000000	1	346393	-0.228783	1.780897	nan	nan!sample_table_end
