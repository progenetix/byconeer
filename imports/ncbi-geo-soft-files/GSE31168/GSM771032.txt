A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771032/suppl/GSM771032_GC-990111T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771032/suppl/GSM771032_GC-990111T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	3.000000	1	51586	0.546384	3.106590	nan	nanCN_473964	3.000000	1	51659	0.129325	3.106700	nan	nanCN_473965	3.000000	1	51674	-0.074231	3.106723	nan	nanCN_473981	3.000000	1	52771	0.384288	3.108378	nan	nanCN_473982	3.000000	1	52788	0.133119	3.108404	nan	nanCN_497981	3.000000	1	62627	0.820856	3.123140	nan	nanCN_502615	3.000000	1	75787	0.162693	3.142447	nan	nanCN_502613	3.000000	1	75849	0.765986	3.142537	nan	nanCN_502614	3.000000	1	76175	0.022874	3.143008	nan	nanCN_502616	3.000000	1	76192	0.616169	3.143032	nan	nanCN_502843	3.000000	1	88453	0.421683	3.160460	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.012812	1.897467	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.372851	1.897535	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.047723	1.897551	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.281722	1.897554	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.521444	1.897637	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.182576	1.898771	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.010353	1.898782	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.184114	2.031465	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.159079	2.031465	nan	nan!sample_table_end
