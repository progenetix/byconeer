A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771096/suppl/GSM771096_GN-73291145N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771096/suppl/GSM771096_GN-73291145N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.478705	1.472209	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.278273	1.472255	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.313740	1.472264	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.941436	1.472943	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.157455	1.472953	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.542234	1.479122	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.227956	1.487609	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.149212	1.487649	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.640809	1.487863	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.807548	1.487874	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.198401	1.496058	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.240638	1.797215	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.347115	1.797359	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.780377	1.797391	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.517366	1.797397	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.573364	1.797570	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.032980	1.799940	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.314761	1.799963	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.180547	2.069920	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.235657	2.069921	nan	nan!sample_table_end
