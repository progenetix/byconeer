A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770605/suppl/GSM770605_GC-49375233T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770605/suppl/GSM770605_GC-49375233T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.546471	1.789145	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.345857	1.789253	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.449212	1.789275	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.228301	1.790894	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.055511	1.790919	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.732017	1.805374	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.152117	1.824466	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.255977	1.824555	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.277623	1.825024	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.359577	1.825048	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.108329	1.842469	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.307051	1.727389	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.608069	1.727371	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.296796	1.727367	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.467876	1.727366	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.055379	1.727344	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.162152	1.727045	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.142008	1.727042	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.091005	1.914933	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.160711	1.914933	nan	nan!sample_table_end
