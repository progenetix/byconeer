A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770061/suppl/GSM770061_GC-047WPK_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770061/suppl/GSM770061_GC-047WPK_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.403098	2.180573	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.092276	2.180655	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.004524	2.180671	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.124918	2.181891	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.015195	2.181910	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.601355	2.192645	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.093842	2.206341	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.300865	2.206403	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.044445	2.206732	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.209891	2.206749	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.024862	2.218680	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.621064	1.210173	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.086175	1.210176	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.520455	1.210177	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.184863	1.210177	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.810472	1.210181	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.298537	1.210238	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.470448	1.210239	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.276952	2.801059	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.263275	2.801059	nan	nan!sample_table_end
