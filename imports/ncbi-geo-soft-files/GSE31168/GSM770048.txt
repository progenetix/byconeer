A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770048/suppl/GSM770048_GC-028LGL_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770048/suppl/GSM770048_GC-028LGL_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	1.000000	1	51586	-0.325613	1.351872	nan	nanCN_473964	1.000000	1	51659	-0.946780	1.352090	nan	nanCN_473965	1.000000	1	51674	-0.896589	1.352135	nan	nanCN_473981	1.000000	1	52771	-0.791010	1.355423	nan	nanCN_473982	1.000000	1	52788	-0.675800	1.355474	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.715360	1.385623	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.388190	1.427752	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.340158	1.427955	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.120804	1.429025	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.784576	1.429080	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.723507	1.470181	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.021470	2.631956	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.916051	2.631883	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.013512	2.631866	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.629695	2.631863	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.274054	2.631774	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.130562	2.630567	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.172600	2.630556	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.737542	3.352159	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.090730	3.352156	nan	nan!sample_table_end
