A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771105/suppl/GSM771105_GN-980029N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771105/suppl/GSM771105_GN-980029N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.246637	1.674811	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.141049	1.674832	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.333826	1.674837	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.037089	1.675154	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.118984	1.675159	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.670833	1.677985	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.271768	1.681660	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.136964	1.681677	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.215208	1.681766	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.093008	1.681770	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	-0.341113	1.685003	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.028193	1.390130	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.312134	1.390149	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.606224	1.390153	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.504908	1.390154	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.091370	1.390177	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.107653	1.390488	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.390486	1.390491	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.166790	3.128483	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.550733	3.128485	nan	nan!sample_table_end
