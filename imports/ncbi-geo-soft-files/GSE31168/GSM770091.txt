A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770091/suppl/GSM770091_GC-2000403T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770091/suppl/GSM770091_GC-2000403T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.020445	2.446920	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.420387	2.447302	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.297402	2.447381	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.270312	2.453135	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.276846	2.453224	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.870543	2.505557	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.104724	2.577352	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.494541	2.577695	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.528382	2.579496	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.666985	2.579590	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.612463	2.647982	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.221080	2.338338	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.661956	2.338302	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.039787	2.338294	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.180746	2.338293	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.066396	2.338250	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.084165	2.337663	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.064335	2.337657	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.240684	1.637869	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.561037	1.637867	nan	nan!sample_table_end
