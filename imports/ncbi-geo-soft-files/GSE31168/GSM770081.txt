A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770081/suppl/GSM770081_GC-2000175T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770081/suppl/GSM770081_GC-2000175T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.166333	1.898250	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.666129	1.898366	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.448158	1.898390	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.382473	1.900131	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.112136	1.900158	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	1.001194	1.916025	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.370725	1.937958	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.084495	1.938063	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.112351	1.938617	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.368929	1.938646	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.644944	1.959860	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.410540	1.983711	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.023232	1.983792	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.125828	1.983810	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.492795	1.983813	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.184099	1.983911	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.021941	1.985238	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.185205	1.985251	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.913038	4.040039	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.214575	4.040035	nan	nan!sample_table_end
