A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770039/suppl/GSM770039_GC-006LTE_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770039/suppl/GSM770039_GC-006LTE_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.551346	2.581229	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.143487	2.581153	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.198247	2.581137	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.277408	2.579998	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.637587	2.579980	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	1.023503	2.569903	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.439836	2.556993	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.198226	2.556934	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.003280	2.556625	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.342152	2.556609	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.659412	2.545460	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.220365	2.758334	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.570326	2.758376	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.015431	2.758386	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.432760	2.758388	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.477841	2.758438	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.325082	2.759128	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.234768	2.759134	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.348027	1.855513	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.468287	1.855511	nan	nan!sample_table_end
