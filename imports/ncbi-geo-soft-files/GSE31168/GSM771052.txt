A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771052/suppl/GSM771052_GN-2000088N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771052/suppl/GSM771052_GN-2000088N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.091720	1.439681	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.017470	1.439631	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.219038	1.439621	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.383620	1.438878	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.300628	1.438866	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.247948	1.432127	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.001386	1.422941	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	-0.417519	1.422898	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.360848	1.422668	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.478151	1.422656	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	-0.451849	1.413960	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.594736	1.990648	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.372042	1.990828	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.236196	1.990868	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.585783	1.990876	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.578026	1.991093	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.183189	1.994055	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.261631	1.994084	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.218344	1.837509	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.354241	1.837508	nan	nan!sample_table_end
