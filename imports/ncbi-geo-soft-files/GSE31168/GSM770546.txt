A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770546/suppl/GSM770546_GC-2000618T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770546/suppl/GSM770546_GC-2000618T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.462929	1.950069	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	0.193382	1.950076	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	0.083417	1.950077	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.084412	1.950185	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.103597	1.950186	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.194285	1.951182	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.011806	1.952622	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.083698	1.952629	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.120103	1.952666	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.296304	1.952668	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.119643	1.954152	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.058928	2.811094	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.449128	2.811143	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.399452	2.811154	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.210418	2.811156	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.148256	2.811216	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.388196	2.812028	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.257433	2.812036	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.169882	2.012951	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.159531	2.012950	nan	nan!sample_table_end
