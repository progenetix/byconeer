A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771077/suppl/GSM771077_GN-2000303N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771077/suppl/GSM771077_GN-2000303N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.419521	2.092763	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	0.133065	2.092648	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	0.106341	2.092624	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.030375	2.090887	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.004102	2.090860	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.451448	2.075312	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.784967	2.054726	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	-0.218637	2.054630	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.167479	2.054125	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.019658	2.054098	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.092586	2.035331	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.089695	2.735545	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.174437	2.735553	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.264581	2.735555	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.404497	2.735555	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.326318	2.735564	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.038310	2.735685	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.460124	2.735687	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.440754	1.568244	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.050735	1.568244	nan	nan!sample_table_end
