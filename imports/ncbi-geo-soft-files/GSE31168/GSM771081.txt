A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771081/suppl/GSM771081_GN-2000433N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771081/suppl/GSM771081_GN-2000433N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.521769	2.599224	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	0.087935	2.599281	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.001997	2.599292	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.229705	2.600147	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.312931	2.600160	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.447062	2.607847	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.078114	2.618154	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.307004	2.618203	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.177852	2.618458	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.504574	2.618471	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.297477	2.628045	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.337972	2.494514	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.198661	2.494488	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.013153	2.494483	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.474701	2.494481	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.109402	2.494450	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.165743	2.494026	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.159051	2.494022	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.086359	1.997101	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.084032	1.997101	nan	nan!sample_table_end
