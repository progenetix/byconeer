A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770568/suppl/GSM770568_GC-20020846T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770568/suppl/GSM770568_GC-20020846T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	4.000000	1	51586	0.127797	3.697653	nan	nanCN_473964	4.000000	1	51659	0.303379	3.697803	nan	nanCN_473965	4.000000	1	51674	0.176554	3.697833	nan	nanCN_473981	4.000000	1	52771	0.475263	3.700078	nan	nanCN_473982	4.000000	1	52788	0.731226	3.700113	nan	nanCN_497981	4.000000	1	62627	0.746137	3.719896	nan	nanCN_502615	4.000000	1	75787	0.508021	3.745175	nan	nanCN_502613	4.000000	1	75849	0.403142	3.745291	nan	nanCN_502614	4.000000	1	76175	0.817278	3.745897	nan	nanCN_502616	4.000000	1	76192	0.829955	3.745929	nan	nanCN_502843	4.000000	1	88453	0.338595	3.767934	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.073418	2.152421	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.044576	2.152409	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.051698	2.152406	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.189658	2.152406	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.041096	2.152392	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.057205	2.152200	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.036556	2.152198	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.356474	1.296304	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.338964	1.296304	nan	nan!sample_table_end
