A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770931/suppl/GSM770931_GC-7847924T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770931/suppl/GSM770931_GC-7847924T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.019137	2.201300	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.212954	2.201461	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.121218	2.201494	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.373060	2.203915	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.126752	2.203953	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.607871	2.225950	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.513549	2.256094	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.693151	2.256238	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.040484	2.256994	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.330986	2.257034	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.499636	2.285779	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.256683	1.984042	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	1.057345	1.983967	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.021686	1.983950	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.300062	1.983947	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.310676	1.983856	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.020488	1.982620	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.194735	1.982609	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.756918	4.331447	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.482392	4.331446	nan	nan!sample_table_end
