A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770555/suppl/GSM770555_GC-2000778T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770555/suppl/GSM770555_GC-2000778T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.439064	2.436765	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.230818	2.436930	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.379455	2.436964	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.043773	2.439451	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.096694	2.439489	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.856071	2.461822	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.264045	2.491673	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.071692	2.491813	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.291628	2.492550	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.308499	2.492589	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.361362	2.520194	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.259477	1.677470	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.227261	1.677576	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.707595	1.677600	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.364978	1.677604	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.733881	1.677733	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.028924	1.679486	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.154398	1.679503	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.369688	2.679794	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.099560	2.679793	nan	nan!sample_table_end
