A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770057/suppl/GSM770057_GC-043WKF_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770057/suppl/GSM770057_GC-043WKF_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	3.000000	1	51586	0.381251	3.032456	nan	nanCN_473964	3.000000	1	51659	-0.048035	3.032743	nan	nanCN_473965	3.000000	1	51674	-0.209328	3.032803	nan	nanCN_473981	3.000000	1	52771	-0.070619	3.037125	nan	nanCN_473982	3.000000	1	52788	0.209514	3.037192	nan	nanCN_497981	3.000000	1	62627	1.023530	3.076140	nan	nanCN_502615	3.000000	1	75787	0.090984	3.128529	nan	nanCN_502613	3.000000	1	75849	0.646328	3.128776	nan	nanCN_502614	3.000000	1	76175	0.458126	3.130075	nan	nanCN_502616	3.000000	1	76192	0.779586	3.130142	nan	nanCN_502843	3.000000	1	88453	0.551144	3.178910	nan	nanCN_466171	3.000000	1	218557	-0.196160	3.071381	nan	nanCN_468414	3.000000	1	218926	1.236446	3.071171	nan	nanCN_468412	3.000000	1	219009	0.577818	3.071124	nan	nanCN_468413	3.000000	1	219024	0.194783	3.071115	nan	nanCN_470565	3.000000	1	219470	0.328657	3.070861	nan	nanCN_468424	3.000000	1	225521	0.037255	3.067405	nan	nanCN_468425	3.000000	1	225579	0.225028	3.067371	nan	nanCN_460512	3.000000	1	346294	0.455293	2.364199	nan	nanCN_460513	3.000000	1	346393	-0.186998	2.364197	nan	nan!sample_table_end
