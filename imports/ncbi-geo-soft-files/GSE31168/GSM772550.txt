A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM772nnn/GSM772550/suppl/GSM772550_GN-990489N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM772nnn/GSM772550/suppl/GSM772550_GN-990489N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_relation = Reanalyzed by: GSE85466!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.265218	1.614602	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	0.171482	1.614602	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.117798	1.614602	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.887596	1.614601	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.211488	1.614601	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.080050	1.614637	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.304991	1.614820	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	-0.042195	1.614821	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.358166	1.614828	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.124379	1.614828	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	-0.083935	1.615159	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.087397	1.777988	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.023111	1.777854	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.097086	1.777824	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.021798	1.777819	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.046855	1.777657	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.194579	1.775460	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.434320	1.775439	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.113723	2.020660	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.130204	2.020660	nan	nan!sample_table_end
