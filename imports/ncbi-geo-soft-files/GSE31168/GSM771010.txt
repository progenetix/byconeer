A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771010/suppl/GSM771010_GC-98748381T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771010/suppl/GSM771010_GC-98748381T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	4.000000	1	51586	0.747820	3.744869	nan	nanCN_473964	4.000000	1	51659	-0.138794	3.744961	nan	nanCN_473965	4.000000	1	51674	0.144863	3.744980	nan	nanCN_473981	4.000000	1	52771	0.983584	3.746362	nan	nanCN_473982	4.000000	1	52788	0.337514	3.746384	nan	nanCN_497981	4.000000	1	62627	0.825483	3.758588	nan	nanCN_502615	4.000000	1	75787	0.553443	3.774288	nan	nanCN_502613	4.000000	1	75849	0.471776	3.774360	nan	nanCN_502614	4.000000	1	76175	0.591239	3.774739	nan	nanCN_502616	4.000000	1	76192	0.526146	3.774759	nan	nanCN_502843	4.000000	1	88453	0.515164	3.788611	nan	nanCN_466171	4.000000	1	218557	-0.047629	3.414213	nan	nanCN_468414	4.000000	1	218926	0.721564	3.414022	nan	nanCN_468412	4.000000	1	219009	0.403297	3.413979	nan	nanCN_468413	4.000000	1	219024	0.686729	3.413971	nan	nanCN_470565	4.000000	1	219470	0.758689	3.413740	nan	nanCN_468424	4.000000	1	225521	0.069132	3.410596	nan	nanCN_468425	4.000000	1	225579	0.406512	3.410566	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.176890	1.500069	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.638189	1.500068	nan	nan!sample_table_end
