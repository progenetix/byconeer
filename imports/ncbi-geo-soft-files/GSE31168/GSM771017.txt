A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771017/suppl/GSM771017_GC-990041T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771017/suppl/GSM771017_GC-990041T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	4.000000	1	51586	0.644914	4.701196	nan	nanCN_473964	4.000000	1	51659	0.358381	4.701302	nan	nanCN_473965	4.000000	1	51674	0.405792	4.701323	nan	nanCN_473981	4.000000	1	52771	0.611115	4.702896	nan	nanCN_473982	4.000000	1	52788	0.906227	4.702920	nan	nanCN_497981	4.000000	1	62627	1.150450	4.716668	nan	nanCN_502615	4.000000	1	75787	0.212397	4.733950	nan	nanCN_502613	4.000000	1	75849	0.552643	4.734028	nan	nanCN_502614	4.000000	1	76175	0.906098	4.734439	nan	nanCN_502616	4.000000	1	76192	1.141647	4.734460	nan	nanCN_502843	4.000000	1	88453	0.665872	4.749251	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.300317	1.492556	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.463671	1.492740	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.732056	1.492781	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.225499	1.492788	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.634867	1.493010	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.041116	1.496039	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.228702	1.496068	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.008775	2.185703	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.133624	2.185704	nan	nan!sample_table_end
