A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771015/suppl/GSM771015_GC-990017T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771015/suppl/GSM771015_GC-990017T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	3.000000	1	51586	0.330743	3.108094	nan	nanCN_473964	3.000000	1	51659	0.080889	3.108259	nan	nanCN_473965	3.000000	1	51674	0.188974	3.108293	nan	nanCN_473981	3.000000	1	52771	0.079188	3.110768	nan	nanCN_473982	3.000000	1	52788	0.204779	3.110806	nan	nanCN_497981	3.000000	1	62627	0.997239	3.133068	nan	nanCN_502615	3.000000	1	75787	0.165030	3.162939	nan	nanCN_502613	3.000000	1	75849	0.368114	3.163080	nan	nanCN_502614	3.000000	1	76175	0.351237	3.163820	nan	nanCN_502616	3.000000	1	76192	0.612114	3.163859	nan	nanCN_502843	3.000000	1	88453	0.592735	3.191649	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.643991	1.644593	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.354278	1.644710	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.129023	1.644736	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.451027	1.644741	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.310493	1.644881	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.114766	1.646802	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.028891	1.646820	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	1.153908	6.088060	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.631366	6.088057	nan	nan!sample_table_end
