A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771151/suppl/GSM771151_GN-990108N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771151/suppl/GSM771151_GN-990108N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.489465	1.440491	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.150170	1.440586	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.335524	1.440605	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.491345	1.442024	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.493516	1.442046	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.423930	1.454934	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.354793	1.472549	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	-0.203146	1.472633	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.160926	1.473074	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.261523	1.473097	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	-0.123932	1.489790	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.046543	2.187893	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.061064	2.187713	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.300593	2.187672	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.102897	2.187665	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.481082	2.187447	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.178115	2.184478	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.192860	2.184449	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.047351	1.733469	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.182023	1.733469	nan	nan!sample_table_end
