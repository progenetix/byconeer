A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770992/suppl/GSM770992_GC-980211T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770992/suppl/GSM770992_GC-980211T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.379719	2.821676	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.558887	2.822073	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.330151	2.822155	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.236278	2.828145	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.286089	2.828238	nan	nanCN_497981	3.000000	1	62627	1.215019	2.882951	nan	nanCN_502615	3.000000	1	75787	0.036862	2.958804	nan	nanCN_502613	3.000000	1	75849	0.137966	2.959168	nan	nanCN_502614	3.000000	1	76175	0.741635	2.961084	nan	nanCN_502616	3.000000	1	76192	0.532714	2.961185	nan	nanCN_502843	3.000000	1	88453	1.087398	3.034491	nan	nanCN_466171	3.000000	1	218557	0.245486	3.695923	nan	nanCN_468414	3.000000	1	218926	0.814506	3.695543	nan	nanCN_468412	3.000000	1	219009	0.558820	3.695458	nan	nanCN_468413	3.000000	1	219024	1.244465	3.695442	nan	nanCN_470565	3.000000	1	219470	0.189128	3.694983	nan	nanCN_468424	3.000000	1	225521	0.105664	3.688730	nan	nanCN_468425	3.000000	1	225579	0.283080	3.688669	nan	nanCN_460512	3.000000	1	346294	0.488849	3.421309	nan	nanCN_460513	3.000000	1	346393	0.372170	3.421309	nan	nan!sample_table_end
