A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771103/suppl/GSM771103_GN-980011N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771103/suppl/GSM771103_GN-980011N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.067895	1.837933	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.249546	1.838030	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.274111	1.838050	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.752872	1.839508	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.117126	1.839530	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.524258	1.852854	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.379677	1.871357	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.206573	1.871446	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.233251	1.871914	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.108227	1.871939	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.445174	1.889893	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.172874	2.701648	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	1.284961	2.701366	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.051487	2.701303	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.110282	2.701292	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.574625	2.700950	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	0.032487	2.696307	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.199275	2.696263	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.238885	1.760619	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.034435	1.760619	nan	nan!sample_table_end
