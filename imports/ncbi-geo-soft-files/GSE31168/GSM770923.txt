A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770923/suppl/GSM770923_GC-69245824T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770923/suppl/GSM770923_GC-69245824T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.125807	2.600865	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	0.149484	2.600950	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.070789	2.600967	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.508390	2.602245	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.294790	2.602265	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.774195	2.613664	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.089546	2.628698	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.202981	2.628768	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.024124	2.629137	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.550433	2.629156	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.350629	2.642865	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.649586	2.069395	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.925498	2.069340	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.226420	2.069328	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.209292	2.069326	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.031905	2.069260	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.179223	2.068365	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.043928	2.068356	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.798021	4.284467	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.423800	4.284465	nan	nan!sample_table_end
