A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771079/suppl/GSM771079_GN-2000362N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771079/suppl/GSM771079_GN-2000362N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.718124	1.672006	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.061720	1.672099	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.116082	1.672119	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.095121	1.673521	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.312045	1.673543	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.700398	1.686203	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.327627	1.703252	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.262757	1.703332	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.231998	1.703755	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.225953	1.703777	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	-0.263739	1.719604	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.288647	1.525375	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.033920	1.525394	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.228846	1.525398	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.550338	1.525399	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.044035	1.525422	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.044748	1.525735	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.329526	1.525738	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.934351	0.914410	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.320786	0.914411	nan	nan!sample_table_end
