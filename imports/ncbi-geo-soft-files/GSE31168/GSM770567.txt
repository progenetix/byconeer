A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770567/suppl/GSM770567_GC-20020455T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770567/suppl/GSM770567_GC-20020455T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	3.000000	1	51586	0.403278	3.087738	nan	nanCN_473964	3.000000	1	51659	0.150140	3.087836	nan	nanCN_473965	3.000000	1	51674	0.029930	3.087856	nan	nanCN_473981	3.000000	1	52771	0.173607	3.089333	nan	nanCN_473982	3.000000	1	52788	0.320471	3.089356	nan	nanCN_497981	3.000000	1	62627	0.915695	3.102422	nan	nanCN_502615	3.000000	1	75787	0.363586	3.119314	nan	nanCN_502613	3.000000	1	75849	0.408814	3.119392	nan	nanCN_502614	3.000000	1	76175	0.209842	3.119801	nan	nanCN_502616	3.000000	1	76192	0.489514	3.119822	nan	nanCN_502843	3.000000	1	88453	0.400736	3.134825	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.118855	1.965655	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.143897	1.965560	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.259733	1.965538	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.325046	1.965534	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.419777	1.965418	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.098723	1.963843	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.191145	1.963827	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.176908	1.711795	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.426461	1.711794	nan	nan!sample_table_end
