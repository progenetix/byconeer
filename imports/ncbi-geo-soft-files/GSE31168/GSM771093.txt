A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771093/suppl/GSM771093_GN-61669256N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771093/suppl/GSM771093_GN-61669256N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.024015	1.971662	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.011404	1.971688	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.270280	1.971693	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.172190	1.972083	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.085333	1.972089	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.695522	1.975555	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.244977	1.980108	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.135592	1.980130	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.236359	1.980241	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.152655	1.980247	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.210863	1.984433	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.438715	1.743079	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.323656	1.743189	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.341805	1.743214	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.435558	1.743219	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.000077	1.743352	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.054258	1.745167	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.178361	1.745184	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.213136	1.585911	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.158917	1.585911	nan	nan!sample_table_end
