A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770553/suppl/GSM770553_GC-2000734T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770553/suppl/GSM770553_GC-2000734T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	4.000000	1	51586	0.835754	4.284925	nan	nanCN_473964	4.000000	1	51659	0.042797	4.284965	nan	nanCN_473965	4.000000	1	51674	0.359350	4.284973	nan	nanCN_473981	4.000000	1	52771	0.820063	4.285562	nan	nanCN_473982	4.000000	1	52788	0.469906	4.285571	nan	nanCN_497981	4.000000	1	62627	1.443501	4.290396	nan	nanCN_502615	4.000000	1	75787	-0.137256	4.295565	nan	nanCN_502613	4.000000	1	75849	0.559182	4.295585	nan	nanCN_502614	4.000000	1	76175	0.975749	4.295694	nan	nanCN_502616	4.000000	1	76192	0.693615	4.295700	nan	nanCN_502843	4.000000	1	88453	0.650199	4.299169	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.257696	2.050116	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.588978	2.050060	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.143218	2.050048	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.404014	2.050045	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.347768	2.049978	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.215716	2.049066	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.108890	2.049058	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.524396	2.882758	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.061938	2.882757	nan	nan!sample_table_end
