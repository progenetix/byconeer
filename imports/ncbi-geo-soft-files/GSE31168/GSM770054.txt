A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770054/suppl/GSM770054_GC-039TSC_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770054/suppl/GSM770054_GC-039TSC_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	4.000000	1	51586	0.604612	4.164182	nan	nanCN_473964	4.000000	1	51659	0.344799	4.164336	nan	nanCN_473965	4.000000	1	51674	0.204925	4.164368	nan	nanCN_473981	4.000000	1	52771	0.809699	4.166686	nan	nanCN_473982	4.000000	1	52788	0.204535	4.166721	nan	nanCN_497981	4.000000	1	62627	1.159232	4.187074	nan	nanCN_502615	4.000000	1	75787	0.587372	4.212911	nan	nanCN_502613	4.000000	1	75849	0.793865	4.213029	nan	nanCN_502614	4.000000	1	76175	0.390386	4.213646	nan	nanCN_502616	4.000000	1	76192	0.880259	4.213678	nan	nanCN_502843	4.000000	1	88453	0.520318	4.236024	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.497922	1.992259	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.489880	1.992180	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.104875	1.992162	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.502297	1.992159	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.156103	1.992063	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.173922	1.990760	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.083557	1.990747	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.456323	3.060708	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.226074	3.060707	nan	nan!sample_table_end
