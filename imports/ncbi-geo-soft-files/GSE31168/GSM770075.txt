A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770075/suppl/GSM770075_GC-2000068T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770075/suppl/GSM770075_GC-2000068T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	1.000000	1	51586	-0.625490	1.244255	nan	nanCN_473964	1.000000	1	51659	-0.657855	1.244323	nan	nanCN_473965	1.000000	1	51674	-0.727807	1.244337	nan	nanCN_473981	1.000000	1	52771	-0.493232	1.245357	nan	nanCN_473982	1.000000	1	52788	-0.326894	1.245372	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.403349	1.254547	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.210712	1.266879	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	-0.030541	1.266937	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.670979	1.267244	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.723607	1.267259	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	-0.036352	1.278775	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.146894	2.303902	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.317437	2.303756	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	0.625026	2.303724	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.205416	2.303718	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.064199	2.303542	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.163331	2.301149	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.016948	2.301126	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.100322	1.635077	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.222767	1.635077	nan	nan!sample_table_end
