A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771082/suppl/GSM771082_GN-2000434N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771082/suppl/GSM771082_GN-2000434N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.354656	2.305693	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	0.197842	2.305743	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.011393	2.305753	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.683867	2.306491	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.380239	2.306503	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.226324	2.313118	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.028961	2.321887	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.267470	2.321929	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	0.220325	2.322144	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.193628	2.322155	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.111077	2.330164	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.152370	2.119310	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.400857	2.119303	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.322046	2.119301	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.081818	2.119300	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.078903	2.119291	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.155484	2.119169	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.246623	2.119168	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.159931	1.830597	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.017990	1.830598	nan	nan!sample_table_end
