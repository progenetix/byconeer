A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770984/suppl/GSM770984_GC-980048T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770984/suppl/GSM770984_GC-980048T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	3.000000	1	51586	0.246525	3.190755	nan	nanCN_473964	3.000000	1	51659	0.019938	3.190870	nan	nanCN_473965	3.000000	1	51674	-0.048687	3.190894	nan	nanCN_473981	3.000000	1	52771	0.523693	3.192629	nan	nanCN_473982	3.000000	1	52788	0.424607	3.192656	nan	nanCN_497981	3.000000	1	62627	1.075838	3.208121	nan	nanCN_502615	3.000000	1	75787	0.183331	3.228507	nan	nanCN_502613	3.000000	1	75849	0.705757	3.228602	nan	nanCN_502614	3.000000	1	76175	0.222668	3.229102	nan	nanCN_502616	3.000000	1	76192	0.229706	3.229128	nan	nanCN_502843	3.000000	1	88453	0.585925	3.247738	nan	nanCN_466171	3.000000	1	218557	0.150175	2.332585	nan	nanCN_468414	3.000000	1	218926	0.308247	2.332478	nan	nanCN_468412	3.000000	1	219009	0.084083	2.332454	nan	nanCN_468413	3.000000	1	219024	0.267785	2.332450	nan	nanCN_470565	3.000000	1	219470	0.063433	2.332321	nan	nanCN_468424	3.000000	1	225521	-0.036966	2.330568	nan	nanCN_468425	3.000000	1	225579	0.024192	2.330551	nan	nanCN_460512	3.000000	1	346294	0.539101	3.269101	nan	nanCN_460513	3.000000	1	346393	0.248934	3.269100	nan	nan!sample_table_end
