A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771113/suppl/GSM771113_GN-980386N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771113/suppl/GSM771113_GN-980386N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.197693	1.675586	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	0.063379	1.675489	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	0.139237	1.675469	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.190378	1.674010	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	-0.157890	1.673987	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	-0.513971	1.660840	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	0.024264	1.643134	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	-0.038492	1.643051	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.184185	1.642611	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.506001	1.642588	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	-0.487827	1.626041	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.470716	2.895507	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.179853	2.895148	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	2.298252	2.895067	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	-0.303239	2.895052	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.963188	2.894618	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.100033	2.888698	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.138606	2.888641	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.017886	1.633365	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.306883	1.633365	nan	nan!sample_table_end
