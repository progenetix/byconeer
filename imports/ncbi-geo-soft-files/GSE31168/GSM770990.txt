A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770990/suppl/GSM770990_GC-980161T_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM770nnn/GSM770990/suppl/GSM770990_GC-980161T_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	-0.266911	1.659199	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.159760	1.659312	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	-0.618801	1.659335	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	-0.954334	1.661038	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.086893	1.661064	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.965168	1.676539	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.291872	1.697806	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.209619	1.697907	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.516610	1.698442	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	-0.481687	1.698470	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.508446	1.718882	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.045478	2.116594	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.311525	2.116534	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.045725	2.116520	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.381512	2.116518	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.329773	2.116445	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.021388	2.115455	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.024962	2.115446	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.574645	2.660014	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.117280	2.660012	nan	nan!sample_table_end
