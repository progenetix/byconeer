A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771102/suppl/GSM771102_GN-970017N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM771nnn/GSM771102/suppl/GSM771102_GN-970017N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	4.000000	1	51586	0.595162	3.541718	nan	nanCN_473964	4.000000	1	51659	0.196181	3.541721	nan	nanCN_473965	4.000000	1	51674	0.256325	3.541722	nan	nanCN_473981	4.000000	1	52771	0.191437	3.541760	nan	nanCN_473982	4.000000	1	52788	0.693066	3.541761	nan	nanCN_497981	4.000000	1	62627	0.941278	3.541552	nan	nanCN_502615	4.000000	1	75787	0.011304	3.539679	nan	nanCN_502613	4.000000	1	75849	1.436869	3.539666	nan	nanCN_502614	4.000000	1	76175	0.178524	3.539596	nan	nanCN_502616	4.000000	1	76192	0.261784	3.539592	nan	nanCN_502843	4.000000	1	88453	0.244565	3.536094	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	-0.162068	1.884052	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	0.046032	1.884055	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.243692	1.884055	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.363331	1.884055	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	-0.257454	1.884058	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.047483	1.884098	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	-0.033776	1.884098	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	0.482103	2.699751	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	-0.000956	2.699749	nan	nan!sample_table_end
