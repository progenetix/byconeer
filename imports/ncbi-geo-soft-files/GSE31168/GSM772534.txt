A reference Model File was created based on 98 non-malignant samples (included as Gastric Normal.REF in the submission). Gastric non-malignant samples and tumors samples were then processed separately using this referenece file by median normalization and GC correlation to obtain the CHP files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Niantao,,Deng!Sample_contact_institute = Duke NUS Graduate Medical School!Sample_contact_address = Center for Computational Biology, level 6, 8 College Road!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169857!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM772nnn/GSM772534/suppl/GSM772534_GN-990172N_V6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM772nnn/GSM772534/suppl/GSM772534_GN-990172N_V6.def.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31168!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	51586	0.175626	2.293471	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	51659	-0.067408	2.293452	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	51674	0.071537	2.293448	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	52771	0.069487	2.293168	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	52788	0.337156	2.293164	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	62627	0.319448	2.290678	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	75787	-0.031817	2.287474	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	75849	0.059743	2.287460	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	76175	-0.035380	2.287383	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	76192	0.071384	2.287379	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	88453	0.229384	2.284592	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	218557	0.236468	2.059779	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	218926	-0.169692	2.059823	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	219009	-0.311894	2.059833	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	219024	0.183357	2.059835	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	219470	0.045872	2.059889	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	225521	-0.010219	2.060618	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	225579	0.192750	2.060625	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	346294	-0.060263	2.050569	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	346393	0.100309	2.050569	nan	nan!sample_table_end
