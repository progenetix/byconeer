Briefly, 21 Î¼l solution containing 500 ng normal DNA (reference DNA) or tumor DNA (test DNA), 20 Î¼l BioPrime DNA Labeling System random primers solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and water were combined and incubated for 5 min at 95 Â°C, and subsequently cooled on ice. After the addition of 5 Î¼l 10x dNTPs labeling mix (1 mM dCTP, 2 mM dATP, 2 mM dGTP, 2 mM dTTP), 3 Î¼l 1 mM Cy-3 or Cy-5 dCTP (GeneChem Inc., Daejeon, Korea), and 40 U BioPrime DNA Labeling System Klenow fragment (Invitrogen), the mixture was gently mixed and incubated overnight at 37 Â°C. The addition of 5 Î¼l BioPrime DNA Labeling System Stop Buffer (Invitrogen) ended the reaction. After labeling, unincorporated fluorescent nucleotides were removed using QIAquick Spin columns (Qiagen, Germany). In one tube, Cy3-labeled sample and Cy5-labeled reference DNAs were mixed together, and 50 Î¼g human Cot I DNA (Invitrogen), 20 Î¼l 3M sodium acetate, and 600 Î¼l cold 100% ethanol were added for DNA precipitation.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Normal human female whole blood!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Normal human female whole blood!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = DNA was extracted from each breast cancer tissue sample using the PureGene kit (Gentra Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = The labeling and hybridization protocols described by Pinkel et al. were used with some modification to the labeling procedure.

The hybridization solution was denatured for 10 min at 72 Â°C and was subsequently incubated for 1 hour at 37 Â°C to allow blocking of repetitive sequences. Hybridization was performed in slide chambers for 48 hours at 37 Â°C. After post-hybridization washes, arrays were rinsed, spin-dried.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned into two 16-bit TIFF image files using a GenePix 4200A two-color fluorescent scanner (Axon Instruments), and individual spots were analyzed with GenePix Pro 3.0 imaging software (Axon Instruments).!Sample_description = SNU_Breast_CGH_S31!Sample_data_processing = The log2-transformed fluorescent ratios were calculated from background-subtracted median intensity values, and these ratios were used to perform normalization according to intensity normalization methods. We applied LOWESS normalization, a smoothing adjustment that removes intensity-dependent variation in dye bias.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5772!Sample_contact_name = Wonshik,,Han!Sample_contact_email = hanw@snu.ac.kr!Sample_contact_phone = 82-2-2072-1958!Sample_contact_fax = 82-2-766-3975!Sample_contact_laboratory = Lab of Breast Cancer Biology!Sample_contact_department = Dept. of Surgery!Sample_contact_institute = Seoul National University College of Medicine!Sample_contact_address = 28 Yongon-dong, Chongno-gu!Sample_contact_city = Seoul!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 110-744!Sample_contact_country = South Korea!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM225nnn/GSM225184/suppl/GSM225184.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE10128!Sample_series_id = GSE10181!Sample_data_row_count = 4044#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 median ratio#Linear_Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Linear_Ratio5784	0.797	1.73745771	-0.0612	0.95852485	0.0805	1.05745706	0.2117	1.158705	-0.1566	0.8971323	-0.1986	0.87141391	0.0779	1.0555122	0.2019	1.1503452	0.0031	1.00222557	0.3321	1.25882492	0.085	1.06071379	-0.2312	0.85192054	0.1297	1.09412887	-0.2227	0.85692974	-0.2215	0.85772533	-0.0359	0.97543027	0.1687	1.12414568	-0.0795	0.94642730	-0.2256	0.8552296	-0.3794	0.7688!sample_table_end
