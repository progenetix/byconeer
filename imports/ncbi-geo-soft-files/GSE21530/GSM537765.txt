Subsequently, the FE files were analyzed using the Agilent Genomic Workbench Standard Edition 5.0.14 software. It allowed applying different algorithms and statistical methods for reporting copy number aberrations (CNA).  The ADM-2 algorithm was chosen for all the samples. The threshold, the nesting level and the aberration filter values were adjusted case by case due to differen  ces in the standard deviation of the log2 ratios of individual cases.  Regions with a log2 ratio > 2 were considered as amplified, regions with a log2 ratio < -1 were considered as homozygously deleted.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Julio,,Finalet!Sample_contact_email = julio.finaletferreiro@med.kuleuven.be!Sample_contact_institute = KULeuven!Sample_contact_address = Herestraat 49!Sample_contact_city = Leuven!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 3000!Sample_contact_country = Belgium!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM537nnn/GSM537765/suppl/GSM537765.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21530!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	6.225129326e-0022	-8.496343130e-0013	-8.744763206e-0014	-9.769737981e-0025	2.241132417e-0016	9.235993748e-0027	-1.164240926e-0018	-1.317879441e-0019	-5.455236698e-00210	1.138420656e-00111	-1.297485887e+00012	2.774847382e-00113	-6.312838814e-00214	-3.387050966e-00215	1.664071399e-00116	-3.272844747e-00217	-1.882765459e-00118	-4.738135773e-00119	-1.661599676e-00120	4.173047219e-003!sample_table_end
