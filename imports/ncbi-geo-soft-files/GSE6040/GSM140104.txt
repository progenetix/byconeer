Microarrays were pre-hybridized with hybridization solution containing 0.5 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 42â for 6 hr. Fluorescent probe mixtures were denatured at 95â for 5 min, and the denatured probe mixtures were applied onto the pre-hybridized chip. And then put a cover glass on it. Chips were hybridized at 42â for 15â17 hr. The hybridized chips were then washed at 60â for 10 min each in solutions of 2Ð¥SSC and 0.2% SDS, 0.1Ð¥SSC and 0.2% SDS, and 0.1Ð¥SSC, and then dried at room temperature.!Sample_scan_protocol = Every slide was scanned by ScanArray 4000B scanner (General Scanning, Watertown, MA).
