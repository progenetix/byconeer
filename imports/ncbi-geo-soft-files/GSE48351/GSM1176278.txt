DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer and Q-Bit fluoremtric assay.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.  The array image was acquired using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Command Console.!Sample_description = hybridized to Affymetrix SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = Copy number values for individual SNP and CNV probes were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Partek Genomics Suite (v6.6) software.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number data was estimated from signal intensity on Affmetrix SNP 6.0 arrays. Copy number ratio values (ratio of the intensity readings from the raw data file to a control) were generated in Partek Genomics Suite (v 6.6) using a Partek corporation distributed baseline (control) file of normal (2N) genomic DNA and default parameters. Post import values were corrected for localized GC content using the inbuilt Partek feature based on methods described in Diskin et al.
