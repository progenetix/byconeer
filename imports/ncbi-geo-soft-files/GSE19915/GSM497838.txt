Probes were heated at 70Â°C for 15 minutes and at 37Â°C for 30 minutes before hybridization to micro arrays for 48-72 hours at 37Â°C. Prior to hybridization, micro arrays were UV-cross linked at 500 mJ/cm2 and pretreated using the Universal Micro array Hybridization Kit (Corning, Acton, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The slides were washed in 2 x SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min, followed by 2 x SSC, 50% formamide (pH 7.0) for 15 min at 45Â°C, 2 x SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 45Â°C, and 0.2 x SSC for 15 min at room temperature.!Sample_scan_protocol = Fluorescence was recorded using an Agilent G2565AA microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies). Image analysis on scanned arrays was performed with GenePix 4.0 (Axon Instruments)!Sample_description = UC_0187_1_BAC_32k_h1!Sample_data_processing = Data was processed in the BioArray Software Environment (BASE). For each channel, the Mean FG - Median BG intensity value was used. Features flagged bad/missing or saturated during image analysis were removed. Poorly measured features with Ch1 or Ch2 signal to noise ratio (SNR) <5 were removed. Data was normalized using the popLowess method (Staaf, et al, BMC Genomics, 2007, 8:382)!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = David,,Lindgren!Sample_contact_email = david.lindgren@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Cancer Research!Sample_contact_department = Dept of Laboratory Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Building 404 A3, ScheelevÃ¤gen 2, Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM497nnn/GSM497838/suppl/GSM497838.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19915!Sample_data_row_count = 31935#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (Cy3/Cy5) representing test/reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	0.5016011642	-0.3058349133	-0.1214319694	-0.735544275	-0.1272961866	-1.1536744277	-0.2221478758	0.0002929	-0.05603919510	-0.19650765611	0.05844018812	0.25674207213	0.2245496214	0.17312155815	0.08167856416	-0.13459487617	0.10225159618	0.14602472919	-0.67015161220	-0.348389789!sample_table_end
