Probes were heated at 70Â°C for 15 minutes and at 37Â°C for 30 minutes before hybridization to micro arrays for 48-72 hours at 37Â°C. Prior to hybridization, micro arrays were UV-cross linked at 500 mJ/cm2 and pretreated using the Universal Micro array Hybridization Kit (Corning, Acton, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The slides were washed in 2 x SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min, followed by 2 x SSC, 50% formamide (pH 7.0) for 15 min at 45Â°C, 2 x SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 45Â°C, and 0.2 x SSC for 15 min at room temperature.!Sample_scan_protocol = Fluorescence was recorded using an Agilent G2565AA microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies). Image analysis on scanned arrays was performed with GenePix 4.0 (Axon Instruments)!Sample_description = UC_0267_3_BAC_32k_h1!Sample_data_processing = Data was processed in the BioArray Software Environment (BASE). For each channel, the Mean FG - Median BG intensity value was used. Features flagged bad/missing or saturated during image analysis were removed. Poorly measured features with Ch1 or Ch2 signal to noise ratio (SNR) <5 were removed. Data was normalized using the popLowess method (Staaf, et al, BMC Genomics, 2007, 8:382)!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = David,,Lindgren!Sample_contact_email = david.lindgren@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Cancer Research!Sample_contact_department = Dept of Laboratory Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Building 404 A3, ScheelevÃ¤gen 2, Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM497nnn/GSM497860/suppl/GSM497860.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19915!Sample_data_row_count = 31935#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (Cy3/Cy5) representing test/reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	0.2775869952	-0.1256176793	0.1087570864	-0.6639547655	0.1295904236	-0.6191549217	0.0399531968	-0.0703239549	-0.08464810	0.23361559611	0.14882155712	-0.09725817213	-0.05230986114	-0.10451937415	-0.12117384216	0.02957024917	-0.06470905418	0.123161719	0.05876313720	0.028852988!sample_table_end
