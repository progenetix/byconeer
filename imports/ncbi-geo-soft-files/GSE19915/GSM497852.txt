Probes were heated at 70Â°C for 15 minutes and at 37Â°C for 30 minutes before hybridization to micro arrays for 48-72 hours at 37Â°C. Prior to hybridization, micro arrays were UV-cross linked at 500 mJ/cm2 and pretreated using the Universal Micro array Hybridization Kit (Corning, Acton, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The slides were washed in 2 x SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min, followed by 2 x SSC, 50% formamide (pH 7.0) for 15 min at 45Â°C, 2 x SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 45Â°C, and 0.2 x SSC for 15 min at room temperature.!Sample_scan_protocol = Fluorescence was recorded using an Agilent G2565AA microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies). Image analysis on scanned arrays was performed with GenePix 4.0 (Axon Instruments)!Sample_description = UC_0231_1_BAC_32k_h1!Sample_data_processing = Data was processed in the BioArray Software Environment (BASE). For each channel, the Mean FG - Median BG intensity value was used. Features flagged bad/missing or saturated during image analysis were removed. Poorly measured features with Ch1 or Ch2 signal to noise ratio (SNR) <5 were removed.
