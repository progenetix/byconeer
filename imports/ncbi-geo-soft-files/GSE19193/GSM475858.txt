We incubated the DNA and the random primers in a volume of 42 ul at 100Â°C for 10-15 min, placed the reaction on ice and added the dNTP solution, labeled nucleotides and Klenow fragment. We incubated the random priming reaction overnight at 37Â°C.

We incubated the random priming reaction overnight at 37Â°C. We removed unincorporated nucleotides using a Sephadex spin-column.!Sample_hyb_protocol = We combined and precipitated 50 ml Cy3 labeled test DNA, 50 ml Cy5 labeled reference DNA and 100 mg human Cot-1 DNA by adding 0.1 volumes of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 2 volumes of ice-cold ethanol. We collected the precipitate by centrifugation and dissolved the pellet in a final hybridization mixture containing 50% formamide, 2xSSC and 4% SDS. We denatured the hybridization mixture at 75Â¬âC for 10-15 min and then incubated the samples at 37Â¬âC for 1 hour to block repetitive DNA sequences. We applied a ring of rubber cement closely around the array to form a well, into which we added 50 ml of a pre-incubation solution containing 250 mg salmon sperm DNA, 50% formamide, 2xSSC and 4% SDS.  After a 30 min incubation at room temperature, we removed ~30 ml of the pre-incubation solution and added the denatured and re-annealed hybridization mixture.  We placed a silicone gasket around each hybridization area, placed a microscope slide on top of the gasket, which was thick enough to prevent the microscope slide from contacting the hybridization solution and clamped the whole unit together using binder clips to create an air tight environment.  We carried out the hybridization to the arrays for ~48 hrs on a slowly rocking table at 37Â¬âC.  After disassembling the hybridization chamber, we rinsed off the excess hybridization fluid with PN buffer (PN: 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 0.1% nonidet P40, pH 8), then washed the arrays once in a solution containing 50% formamide in 2xSSC for 15 min. at 45Â¬âC and finally in PN buffer at room temperature for 15 min.  Subsequently, we removed the ring of rubber cement, drained excess liquid from the arrays, mounted them in a solution containing 90% glycerol, 10% PBS and 1 mM DAPI, and sealed them with a cover slip.!Sample_scan_protocol = We acquired 16 bit 1024x1024 pixel DAPI, Cy3 and Cy5 images using a custom built CCD camera system. We used SPOT2.0 software to automatically segment the spots based on the DAPI images, perform local background correction and to calculate various measurement parameters, including log2ratios of the total integrated Cy3 and Cy5 intensities for each spot.  We used a second custom program SPROC to associate clone identities and a mapping information file with each spot!Sample_description = Bladder tumor sample against normal reference DNA.!Sample_data_processing = SPROC also implements a filtering procedure to reject data based on a number of criteria, including low reference/DAPI signal intensity and low correlation of the Cy3 and Cy5 intensities with a spot.  The SPROC output consists of averaged ratios of the triplicate spots for each clone, standard deviations of the triplicates and plotting position for each clone on the array, as well as other clone information stored in the database, such as STS content.  We edited the data files to remove ratios on clones for which only one of the triplicates remained after SPROC analysis and/or the standard deviation of the log2ratios of the triplicates was > 0.2.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4999!Sample_contact_name = Eric,,LetouzÃ©!Sample_contact_email = Eric.letouze@inserm.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers!Sample_contact_institute = Ligue Contre Le Cancer!Sample_contact_address = 15 rue de l'Ã©cole de mÃ©decine!Sample_contact_city = Paris!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75006!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM475nnn/GSM475858/suppl/GSM475858_407_scan_data.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19193!Sample_series_id = GSE19195!Sample_data_row_count = 2464#ID_REF = Unique row identifier, genome position order#VALUE = aka LOG2RATIO, mean of log base 2 of LINEAR_RATIO#LINEAR_RATIO = Mean of replicate Cy5/Cy3 ratios#LOG2STDDEV = Standard deviation of VALUE#NO_REPLICATES = Number of replicate spot measurements!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	LINEAR_RATIO	LOG2STDDEV	NO_REPLICATESHumArray2H11_N30				0HumArray2H11_C9	-0.105761	0.929315	0.002438	3HumArray2H10_N30	0.081726	1.058283	0.002587	3HumArray2H10_B18	0.047431	1.033423	0.004385	3HumArray2H10_Q30	0.148164	1.108158	0.002474	3HumArray2H10_T30	0.049537	1.034933	0.004748	3HumArray2H10_B19	0.081476	1.0581	0.005932	3HumArray2H10_W30	0.133686	1.097093	0.016739	3HumArray2H9_C14	0.031147	1.021825	0.006493	3HumArray2H9_F14	0.029249	1.020481	0.006543	3HumArray2H9_I14	0.084002	1.059954	0.004702	3HumArray2H9_A23	0.171524	1.126248	0.00943	3HumArray2H9_L14	0.081483	1.058105	0.004991	3HumArray2H9_O14	0.138502	1.100761	0.004484	3HumArray2H11_L8	0.085542	1.061087	0.010156	3HumArray2H9_B4	0.078291	1.055766	0.001575	3HumArray2H10_E19	0.066597	1.047243	0.015607	3HumArray2H9_U14	0.114518	1.082614	0.006471	3HumArray2H9_R14	0.115425	1.083294	0.005065	3HumArray2H9_C17	0.04274	1.030068	0.003441	3!sample_table_end
