RNA was qualityâcontrolled and quantified using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent). DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions using 50ng of DNA.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScanHD array!Sample_data_processing = Arrays were scanned with the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G and copy number analysis was done with Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite software version 2.1.0.16(r6634) and Annotation Net Affx Build 33. Interpretation was based on human reference sequence GRCh37/hg19, February 2009. The complete data set was visually analyzed. Gains and losses had to meet three criteria to be reported: A minimum of 25 markers per segment, 100 kb minimum genomic length, and less than 50% overlap with known CN variants from the Database of Genomic Variants and/or in-house data obtained from analyzing family trios with a non-cancerous phenotype. Copy number aberrations located at 2p11.2 (IgK@), 14q32.33 (IgH@), and 22q11.22 (IgL@) which might stem from rearrangements of the B-cell receptor gene were excluded from further analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Granzow!Sample_contact_email = granzow@uni-heidelberg.de!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Heidelberg!Sample_contact_address = INF 366!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2385nnn/GSM2385461/suppl/GSM2385461_AL47.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2385nnn/GSM2385461/suppl/GSM2385461_AL47.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2385nnn/GSM2385461/suppl/GSM2385461_AL47.cyhd.cychp.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE89616!Sample_data_row_count = 0
