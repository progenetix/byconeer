Genomic DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and  with ethanol.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Random prime probe labeling was performed to label sample and reference genomic DNA (250ng each).  Each reaction was labeled with either 2 nmol of cyanine-3 or cyanine-5 dCTP.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Normal male!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Novagen pooled normal male genomic DNA.!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Purchased genomic DNA.!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Random prime probe labeling was performed to label sample and reference genomic DNA (250ng each). Each reaction was labeled with either 2 nmol of cyanine-3 or cyanine-5 dCTP.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Probes were combined, denatured and annealed in a solution containing 100 ug human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen) and 48 ul DIG Easy hybridization solution (Roche) containing sheared herring sperm DNA (Sigma-Aldrich) and yeast tRNA (Calbiochem). Probe was denautred at 85Â°C for 5 minutes, and repetitive sequences were blocked at 45Â°C for 1 hour prior to hybridization. The probe mixture was applied to the slide surface and hybridized for 36 hrs at 45Â°C. The arrays were washed 5 times in 0.1X SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature with agitation. Each array was then rinsed repeatedly in 0.1X SSC and dried by centrifugation.!Sample_scan_protocol = A charge-coupled device (CCD) scanner system (ARrayworx eAuto, API, Issaquah, WA) was used to determine the signal intensities of the Cyanine 5/Cyanine3 channels. Arrays were scanned at a 9.75um resolution; exposure times for each image wavelength were usually between 0.2 to 2 sec. Images were analyzed by SoftWoRx Tracker analysis software (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA, USA).!Sample_description = N/A!Sample_data_processing = A three-step normalization procedure [Khojasteh et al.
