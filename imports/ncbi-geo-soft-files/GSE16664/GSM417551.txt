Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This sample was hybridized to a single array (two color-reversals not performed).!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8720!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM417nnn/GSM417551/suppl/GSM417551_MR2403.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16664!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 346769#ID_REF = #F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Normalized Channels (Cy5 and Cy3)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	579.467	642.151	617.78	606.087	.704689	.636254	1.10756	0.1474	1.107562	4121.29	4518.45	4094.33	4388.43	3.42121	3.96906	.861971	-0.2143	.8619713	155.324	239.044	194.572	198.458	.18426	.190058	.969492	-0.0447	.9694924	4931.68	4982.92	4878.77	4830.96	4.23577	4.43767	.954504	-0.0672	.9545045	280.333	290.471	318.64	250.836	.263299	.216852	1.21419	0.2800	1.214196	171.898	234.924	210.879	194.327	.22357	.201644	1.10874	0.1489	1.108747	1542.38	1583.49	1575.15	1543.71	1.99809	1.82049	1.09756	0.1343	1.097568	2134.65	1849.85	2156.25	1804.29	2.02066	1.66686	1.21226	0.2777	1.212269	117.6	149.253	157.994	116.19	.144334	.10467	1.37894	0.4636	1.3789410	728.404	781.733	767.151	747.27	.795721	.763676	1.04196	0.0593	1.0419611	1726.33	1577.42	1755.48	1537.73	1.83269	1.693	1.08251	0.1144	1.0825112	912.791	992.067	950.165	956.676	.925813	.925453	1.00039	0.0006	1.0003913	5569.83	4169.63	5490.86	4053.31	4.5817	3.57428	1.28185	0.3582	1.2818514	946.822	1126.88	983.887	1090.33	.929426	1.02489	.906851	-0.1411	.90685115	2937.39	2398.62	2942.4	2338.47	3.28659	2.54935	1.28919	0.3665	1.2891916	531.236	718.969	569.269	683.715	.575918	.678849	.848373	-0.2372	.84837317	311.356	314.031	349.639	274.644	.431631	.334077	1.29201	0.3696	1.2920118	5232.98	5537.43	5168.07	5355.63	4.16738	4.54551	.916813	-0.1253	.91681319	4713.48	6706.56	4668.9	6456.33	4.80733	6.62619	.725505	-0.4629	.72550520	3801.46	5671.96	3782.77	5482.57	4.38249	6.13436	.714417	-0.4852	.714417!sample_table_end
