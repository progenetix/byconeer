The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM877nnn/GSM877963/suppl/GSM877963_448.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31277#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	0.042596	9502.0560000	12143.5880000	0.9700002	0.530033	5223.3680000	8829.5140000	0.9100003	0.106679	7049.8720000	8971.3430000	0.9200004	0.051845	7791.9230000	9649.4360000	0.8100005	-0.230031	12758.2900000	14143.1280000	0.8300006	-0.228263	12032.6320000	13171.4460000	0.8300007	0.212613	8274.7350000	11743.2740000	0.8000008	0.185849	10859.7400000	16040.1910000	0.9100009	0.366662	6447.4490000	9813.1980000	0.86000010	0.302583	770.1470000	875.9810000	0.08000011	0.201487	13556.6480000	21670.0020000	0.84000012	0.080005	6107.7250000	7557.6150000	0.90000013	-0.047152	5719.1630000	6463.8490000	0.87000014	-0.019987	5195.4110000	6018.3430000	0.86000015	0.256821	10063.0180000	15318.0090000	0.87000016	0.168234	9534.6620000	13434.5630000	0.79000017	-0.148794	16501.5840000	21346.8220000	0.89000018	-0.193388	9378.2050000	9995.9220000	0.90000019	-0.142548	8479.1260000	9210.5070000	0.82000020	-0.338872	17267.6640000	19467.7300000	0.790000!sample_table_end
