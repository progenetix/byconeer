The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878048/suppl/GSM878048_587.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	0.246725	713.7600000	180.2370000	0.0700002	0.471966	1635.3960000	610.9160000	0.4800003	1.043150	535.7600000	232.4420000	0.1300004	-0.015610	5151.0420000	1420.9670000	0.6800005	0.216403	1525.0420000	464.3440000	0.4000006	0.212672	4040.1810000	1307.9780000	0.8300007	0.235741	7969.6270000	2594.9210000	0.8700008	0.389735	10965.0500000	3899.0670000	0.9000009	0.534822	1331.8830000	502.1560000	0.29000010	-0.169594	7088.5290000	1750.9710000	0.75000011	0.299570	12486.0680000	4144.4540000	0.67000012	-0.005892	5060.7660000	1400.7770000	0.81000013	0.141448	1453.4320000	411.7290000	0.25000014	0.734880	777.2620000	296.2210000	0.14000015	0.290196	1428.3820000	451.4620000	0.38000016	0.108958	2408.4070000	723.1430000	0.49000017	0.189908	1282.4590000	366.2070000	0.30000018	0.061470	2781.9400000	807.9650000	0.37000019	0.057446	2010.3950000	570.6510000	0.23000020	0.017609	10878.5180000	3013.5550000	0.650000!sample_table_end
