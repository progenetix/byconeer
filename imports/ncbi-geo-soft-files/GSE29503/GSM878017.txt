The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878017/suppl/GSM878017_360.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	0.410773	488.2340000	296.4760000	0.0100002	0.010028	2540.8880000	1511.5530000	0.4000003	0.001299	13806.0580000	7928.2980000	0.7000004	0.064139	5730.8140000	3534.8310000	0.9100005	-0.113712	13067.8700000	6981.4250000	0.9500006	0.140128	20783.9860000	12993.1700000	0.8600007	0.335828	17308.4630000	12407.9460000	0.9000008	-0.027011	1237.8930000	685.9760000	0.0100009	-0.125293	6352.5440000	3439.0460000	0.89000010	0.087505	28655.3690000	17143.3160000	0.84000011	0.037588	28040.3010000	16255.3950000	0.89000012	0.091366	16730.1500000	10171.1530000	0.96000013	0.082605	9415.1260000	5809.6270000	0.95000014	0.217056	3346.2800000	2298.3920000	0.79000015	0.359208	623.1720000	397.8960000	0.03000016	0.088807	10678.0600000	6568.1550000	0.78000017	0.150824	7232.3760000	4726.6160000	0.90000018	0.234176	9233.4600000	6300.6330000	0.82000019	0.294131	13229.4960000	9283.8440000	0.83000020	0.044842	14639.6960000	8648.7190000	0.910000!sample_table_end
