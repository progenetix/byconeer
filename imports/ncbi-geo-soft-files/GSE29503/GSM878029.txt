The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878029/suppl/GSM878029_486.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	-1.722876	914.6790000	130.4050000	0.0500002	0.072820	2320.1660000	2079.9920000	0.5100003	-0.362621	6333.3280000	4053.7500000	0.7700004	-0.316015	6783.5040000	4465.9430000	0.7800005	-0.447234	3957.2910000	2434.0090000	0.7400006	-0.196856	5602.6580000	4037.8830000	0.8000007	0.143473	7749.7220000	6930.3070000	0.7300008	-0.385905	15862.7640000	9262.4560000	0.6800009	0.020254	2118.6230000	1835.3710000	0.43000010	-0.226337	11216.5810000	7608.5170000	0.69000011	0.178709	15822.4400000	13332.4330000	0.66000012	-0.325890	8056.3650000	5241.9350000	0.82000013	0.375872	2260.2560000	2490.2100000	0.55000014	0.013025	1295.9530000	1056.5740000	0.22000015	-0.199643	2305.0540000	1710.9940000	0.57000016	-0.220490	3469.5630000	2510.1290000	0.70000017	0.097486	2573.4770000	2333.9590000	0.61000018	-0.158497	4225.5650000	3153.7950000	0.77000019	0.001020	3289.2950000	2768.4230000	0.69000020	-0.299794	11263.1500000	7299.4260000	0.820000!sample_table_end
