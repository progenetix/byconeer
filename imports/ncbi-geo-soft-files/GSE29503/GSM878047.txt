The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878047/suppl/GSM878047_586.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	0.075068	662.7460000	506.5000000	0.0800002	0.621245	1235.2000000	1616.3280000	0.2200003	0.263800	10002.5170000	10926.7520000	0.8500004	0.131000	12077.6190000	11981.3070000	0.8200005	0.322624	3643.8710000	4088.2660000	0.6400006	0.314431	7118.3330000	8138.2390000	0.9100007	0.285592	13183.8680000	14497.5120000	0.9000008	0.018024	25817.8650000	23994.1040000	0.8600009	0.325960	1332.8790000	1417.0110000	0.23000010	0.068115	11647.6930000	11088.8950000	0.59000011	0.474662	22978.2170000	29481.8220000	0.73000012	-0.039878	6421.6210000	5710.4810000	0.52000013	0.261450	1686.9030000	1759.2690000	0.26000014	0.014739	1225.8740000	1023.2010000	0.24000015	0.464187	2171.5930000	2646.2910000	0.59000016	0.222663	3767.0430000	3945.2680000	0.65000017	0.056647	2067.5350000	1889.9000000	0.22000018	0.403609	4357.2230000	5197.6110000	0.47000019	0.012887	4023.4970000	3644.9250000	0.70000020	-0.056123	17393.1800000	15153.4860000	0.650000!sample_table_end
