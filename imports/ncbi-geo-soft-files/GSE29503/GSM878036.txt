The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878036/suppl/GSM878036_512.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	-0.213562	488.4860000	304.0520000	0.1000002	0.600514	2311.3840000	3096.6640000	0.6000003	0.093128	11991.6030000	11005.1550000	0.8500004	0.026054	12549.0760000	11012.8950000	0.8200005	0.050556	6292.4170000	5580.3010000	0.8400006	-0.298683	13502.0480000	9498.7920000	0.9600007	0.402228	15918.7790000	17639.5100000	0.9300008	0.219382	21102.3110000	20583.4820000	0.8400009	0.543108	1586.1270000	2100.0260000	0.58000010	0.309730	24472.5840000	25583.7110000	0.71000011	0.450824	22862.5960000	26431.6310000	0.76000012	0.015071	8111.3620000	7083.4870000	0.70000013	0.468471	3703.7320000	4411.2830000	0.71000014	0.319196	2518.7110000	2779.6540000	0.78000015	0.570659	2834.1620000	3653.7350000	0.73000016	0.361503	5549.7380000	6107.9000000	0.84000017	0.258396	2349.8970000	2491.1370000	0.42000018	0.340521	8045.4300000	8867.5120000	0.83000019	0.034164	4884.6430000	4281.5150000	0.78000020	0.130546	21073.4000000	19386.6460000	0.580000!sample_table_end
