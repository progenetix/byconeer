The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878033/suppl/GSM878033_526.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	-0.163510	373.3860000	193.5240000	0.0200002	0.406607	1957.3800000	2112.3500000	0.4900003	-0.411146	37461.4960000	22261.5860000	0.5000004	0.197604	14144.2910000	12747.7550000	0.8100005	0.140261	6517.1040000	5641.8160000	0.9300006	0.099188	11739.4890000	10009.3370000	0.9300007	0.211481	14636.1430000	13277.0170000	0.9000008	0.180371	19818.7090000	17392.2420000	0.9100009	0.170823	1850.4180000	1701.0950000	0.43000010	0.600164	16540.2890000	19314.6150000	0.85000011	0.698850	23244.3440000	29513.8590000	0.83000012	0.019484	8051.2200000	6392.3940000	0.66000013	0.341617	2980.9940000	3009.6810000	0.70000014	0.331938	1804.1250000	1848.7190000	0.38000015	0.372245	2200.9600000	2300.9160000	0.70000016	0.242250	4762.0100000	4448.3240000	0.86000017	-0.090192	1961.6580000	1510.0410000	0.40000018	0.170019	8883.7050000	7915.7460000	0.79000019	0.254757	5113.6310000	4787.1990000	0.65000020	0.178185	21942.3570000	19160.2910000	0.780000!sample_table_end
