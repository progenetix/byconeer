The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878039/suppl/GSM878039_519.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	0.468011	381.8000000	271.8210000	0.0400002	0.383313	1537.4850000	1534.4660000	0.4200003	-0.117691	11832.4420000	8048.9810000	0.8600004	-0.354678	11111.0070000	6389.3810000	0.9100005	-0.760848	6487.7670000	2862.8170000	0.8600006	-0.835506	13665.7140000	5639.8070000	0.9200007	-0.088322	15090.6350000	10366.7030000	0.8700008	-0.547490	14941.1150000	7533.0460000	0.8700009	-0.249824	1768.6060000	1138.3700000	0.26000010	0.198349	20900.3540000	17003.7870000	0.84000011	0.255404	19830.2770000	16863.2750000	0.86000012	-0.304618	10886.1590000	6482.7950000	0.78000013	0.328121	4371.7210000	4112.3870000	0.70000014	-0.225195	1861.1690000	1217.4980000	0.34000015	0.259742	1373.1970000	1249.8600000	0.31000016	0.026141	5570.0250000	4231.1480000	0.65000017	0.079990	3159.9890000	2554.5560000	0.47000018	-0.066311	7831.4130000	5516.0150000	0.57000019	-0.524088	5674.7330000	2954.8550000	0.60000020	-0.377578	30581.0020000	16479.2250000	0.910000!sample_table_end
