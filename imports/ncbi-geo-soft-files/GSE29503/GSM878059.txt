The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878059/suppl/GSM878059_593.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	0.048516	881.4950000	1049.2640000	0.4600002	1.268395	572.1670000	1589.8180000	0.3200003	-0.038287	2958.9430000	3358.5540000	0.5600004	0.131790	2534.0210000	3219.9090000	0.6500005	0.201628	2993.6540000	4047.1120000	0.4600006	1.106227	3355.2270000	8584.2610000	0.7400007	0.280867	4157.9240000	6038.2310000	0.5900008	-0.013657	5337.5610000	6247.9840000	0.5300009	0.377352	404.7310000	530.4590000	0.08000010	0.520836	6888.8370000	11127.5980000	0.50000011	0.606808	4324.6020000	7761.0930000	0.69000012	-0.436284	1966.0630000	1643.7610000	0.51000013	0.769759	1046.1130000	2027.1710000	0.45000014	0.349924	833.9720000	1225.4110000	0.34000015	0.602929	557.5730000	965.6730000	0.29000016	0.173657	1545.5680000	1976.5650000	0.57000017	-0.352356	801.5780000	719.5770000	0.26000018	0.333454	2328.6020000	3395.2360000	0.63000019	-0.005891	1217.4550000	1381.5690000	0.39000020	0.434991	5706.7890000	8886.4060000	0.610000!sample_table_end
