The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878053/suppl/GSM878053_589.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	2.185946	156.6580000	557.5800000	0.1200002	0.604504	1397.5620000	2150.1420000	0.6100003	0.206641	6559.7580000	7063.7470000	0.9300004	-0.207504	5914.6880000	4785.9180000	0.9000005	-0.465131	2638.4700000	1854.7800000	0.6200006	-0.594304	5140.8220000	3174.9500000	0.8200007	-0.107348	6369.7720000	5547.0800000	0.7700008	-0.198534	9760.2610000	7841.1890000	0.8200009	-0.146727	1027.0410000	1074.4380000	0.37000010	-0.327160	5945.5500000	4419.3980000	0.77000011	0.341412	6887.2880000	8084.0250000	0.81000012	-0.195471	2929.1720000	2440.8020000	0.62000013	-0.057152	1401.8730000	1437.2290000	0.55000014	-0.493032	655.6190000	599.9470000	0.16000015	0.058734	398.7110000	452.4610000	0.15000016	-1.709118	1188.6070000	458.2420000	0.28000017	-0.905675	837.7450000	568.7910000	0.19000018	-2.105814	3563.4610000	841.5200000	0.25000019	-0.955104	20865.0490000	9996.5120000	0.46000020	-0.785519	5131.5160000	2778.5110000	0.360000!sample_table_end
