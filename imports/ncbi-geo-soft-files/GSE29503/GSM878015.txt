The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878015/suppl/GSM878015_444.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31277#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	-0.521225	18903.3180000	13029.1970000	0.7500002	0.470488	8536.0320000	10695.9170000	0.8400003	0.229631	12152.3200000	13578.0210000	0.9100004	-0.413721	16921.0040000	12360.0180000	0.8700005	0.409384	21136.9840000	30401.1070000	0.7900006	-0.022306	18073.0450000	18262.3610000	0.8700007	0.167269	11695.4660000	12348.5000000	0.9300008	0.025523	19051.9320000	20181.2340000	0.9500009	0.392387	10630.1090000	13090.6660000	0.87000010	0.182877	2722.2610000	2632.6670000	0.42000011	0.147780	23486.1070000	28327.4880000	0.74000012	-0.111703	13767.2600000	12108.2050000	0.91000013	0.136742	7350.8710000	7060.0880000	0.70000014	0.203801	10110.5590000	10676.3050000	0.94000015	0.153296	13595.6660000	14661.0920000	0.80000016	-0.172763	15960.1350000	13860.9260000	0.86000017	-0.242181	21450.4960000	19014.8590000	0.95000018	0.189056	15128.9630000	17158.7440000	0.91000019	-0.334448	15515.4510000	11795.9820000	0.88000020	-0.354256	28762.1000000	24520.5390000	0.780000!sample_table_end
