The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878046/suppl/GSM878046_518.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	-0.585989	591.4190000	175.8270000	0.0700002	0.502420	2761.9270000	2813.9020000	0.6600003	0.149189	17491.3260000	12970.3970000	0.8400004	-0.148005	12957.4790000	8239.1180000	0.9100005	-0.359958	8024.6540000	4331.0570000	0.7700006	-0.427851	15130.8010000	7938.3810000	0.9000007	0.259981	21004.5900000	16256.3290000	0.8500008	-0.019593	32811.6330000	20739.2130000	0.8600009	-0.099936	2432.0950000	1657.2350000	0.54000010	-0.207455	19331.1050000	11251.6000000	0.70000011	0.382870	18424.7600000	15688.7030000	0.78000012	-0.217467	12885.8250000	7809.1730000	0.75000013	0.244310	4155.0630000	3480.9570000	0.57000014	-0.092154	3576.3330000	2417.7800000	0.74000015	0.569661	3196.3810000	3382.4870000	0.80000016	0.275803	8072.3940000	6793.4940000	0.89000017	-0.276262	4948.4130000	2888.8910000	0.62000018	0.092472	11612.9830000	8723.2770000	0.76000019	-0.268164	10500.6710000	6082.7260000	0.61000020	0.014843	35636.6520000	23154.9120000	0.730000!sample_table_end
