The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878019/suppl/GSM878019_364.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	1.956866	176.7210000	405.9870000	0.0100002	-0.035834	1689.8340000	1650.9210000	0.4500003	0.200208	12113.3010000	12826.3940000	0.9300004	-0.046203	5403.3340000	5050.4160000	0.9200005	-0.214684	12811.1340000	10257.8510000	0.9500006	0.246000	16343.5190000	17317.2290000	0.9200007	0.244929	12281.5860000	13342.7590000	0.8600008	-1.049629	704.4750000	256.5830000	0.0100009	0.059485	3022.5700000	3091.8810000	0.71000010	-0.252907	26633.3830000	19545.8790000	0.86000011	0.250926	23739.9040000	24646.7070000	0.91000012	0.139969	13986.7040000	13986.9100000	0.93000013	0.705967	8168.3730000	12596.4010000	0.88000014	-0.061462	3647.9040000	3417.2460000	0.80000015	0.534784	579.7450000	760.0630000	0.10000016	-0.012133	8586.4050000	8127.9340000	0.93000017	0.109901	6210.7020000	6433.3150000	0.89000018	0.560039	8168.0100000	11449.1600000	0.94000019	0.271490	11231.9250000	12553.7260000	0.95000020	-0.269360	13447.4130000	10386.6870000	0.910000!sample_table_end
