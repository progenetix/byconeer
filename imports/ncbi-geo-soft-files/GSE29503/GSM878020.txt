The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878020/suppl/GSM878020_356.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	-1.527934	1002.7580000	379.3530000	0.0900002	-0.128386	1474.8910000	1512.1670000	0.3700003	0.387258	9185.8650000	12738.6180000	0.9500004	-0.392589	4502.7910000	3623.0800000	0.8600005	-0.281769	9934.9190000	8653.2570000	0.9400006	-0.648511	14721.7580000	9890.2070000	0.9100007	-0.132297	11353.1070000	10925.4970000	0.9600008	-0.825327	384.0010000	198.9220000	0.0100009	0.082753	2920.5260000	3300.0500000	0.72000010	-0.558437	21712.3460000	15265.8610000	0.97000011	-0.142116	20514.8630000	19142.2540000	0.95000012	-0.223166	10522.3980000	9552.5060000	0.90000013	0.126477	6058.3930000	6953.2150000	0.75000014	0.067437	3154.8270000	3529.3510000	0.77000015	0.429212	476.8570000	694.5630000	0.06000016	-0.022734	6167.1550000	6373.3700000	0.85000017	-0.331658	6225.6630000	5193.4150000	0.87000018	-0.084946	6894.8130000	6860.7240000	0.92000019	-0.330083	9471.5020000	7955.3260000	0.96000020	-0.091283	11414.1650000	11343.5020000	0.840000!sample_table_end
