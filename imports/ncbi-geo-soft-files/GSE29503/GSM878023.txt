The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878023/suppl/GSM878023_411.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	1.698363	262.4920000	473.6290000	0.0100002	0.353880	1174.8740000	1110.7290000	0.3900003	-0.071295	10873.8800000	6673.2670000	0.8200004	0.228547	4756.9710000	3741.7720000	0.9300005	-0.366283	12580.6680000	6239.3400000	0.9500006	-0.413263	13063.2910000	6292.7040000	0.9300007	0.069038	6051.0070000	4211.4150000	0.6300008	-0.472571	312.4420000	61.9350000	0.0100009	-0.094574	1202.8340000	842.8180000	0.05000010	-0.599641	21654.1250000	8802.7930000	0.65000011	0.738404	11348.9900000	11808.0770000	0.76000012	-0.285128	7296.2410000	3974.6110000	0.79000013	0.018178	5072.3340000	3456.9970000	0.67000014	0.182393	3715.9380000	2850.0660000	0.72000015	0.869218	435.4110000	535.3820000	0.02000016	0.033738	7209.0620000	4855.5210000	0.96000017	-0.205363	7080.9750000	4074.5450000	0.94000018	0.190492	7374.5080000	5535.0680000	0.95000019	0.191309	10149.1540000	7454.6190000	0.90000020	-0.047407	11159.9270000	6913.8700000	0.850000!sample_table_end
