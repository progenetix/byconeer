The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878026/suppl/GSM878026_627.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	-1.526776	2277.9290000	97.8820000	0.0700002	-0.760934	1772.1340000	140.2400000	0.0600003	0.504071	3815.3820000	3357.5920000	0.6300004	-0.026112	5662.3670000	3474.5620000	0.5400005	0.057227	2839.0560000	1952.5950000	0.3900006	-0.225045	6434.1880000	3469.5570000	0.4900007	0.493625	5048.2710000	4499.4860000	0.6600008	0.832879	5729.7540000	6643.8810000	0.6100009	0.284705	1710.5990000	1158.8860000	0.17000010	1.001483	4037.1860000	5060.5430000	0.64000011	0.353674	8379.1360000	7211.0750000	0.60000012	1.539611	1214.1210000	2156.5830000	0.26000013	0.384713	1926.9750000	1602.4210000	0.25000014	1.327134	957.7340000	608.4060000	0.07000015	-0.035527	4630.4810000	2808.6180000	0.53000016	0.576769	2011.9060000	1971.9700000	0.41000017	0.415388	1568.5680000	1090.8340000	0.19000018	0.789783	1848.2990000	2098.9950000	0.38000019	0.409749	2917.4190000	2518.2250000	0.44000020	0.768803	5675.3540000	6257.4860000	0.620000!sample_table_end
