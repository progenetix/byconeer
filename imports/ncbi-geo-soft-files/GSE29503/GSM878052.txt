The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878052/suppl/GSM878052_603.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	0.208356	266.3130000	172.6480000	0.0500002	0.270526	1511.9850000	1321.8560000	0.6700003	0.099455	4729.6790000	3472.2590000	0.8900004	-0.258629	5166.1120000	2964.0380000	0.7100005	-0.331898	3528.5600000	1932.9220000	0.5400006	-0.527205	7284.3260000	3511.3790000	0.6900007	-0.127740	10234.6070000	6432.4150000	0.7900008	-0.393162	21455.9100000	11189.7290000	0.7800009	0.142140	659.9200000	566.4810000	0.17000010	0.054271	14461.5790000	10124.8970000	0.50000011	-0.328439	17310.8380000	9306.2550000	0.54000012	-0.428504	6320.4740000	3252.9910000	0.70000013	0.361582	2249.8370000	2008.8250000	0.73000014	0.149211	890.9730000	765.6810000	0.37000015	0.082142	2093.5630000	1563.1410000	0.75000016	0.036157	3987.3380000	2789.1120000	0.67000017	-0.413805	1567.8670000	872.6460000	0.39000018	0.040999	4700.6840000	3306.5550000	0.50000019	-0.416671	4027.6100000	2065.7000000	0.47000020	-0.249714	17139.3950000	9762.3000000	0.500000!sample_table_end
