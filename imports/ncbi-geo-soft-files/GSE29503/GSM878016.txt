The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878016/suppl/GSM878016_443.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31277#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	-0.247405	18834.3570000	15704.6920000	0.8900002	0.192263	9496.3170000	10567.3620000	0.8900003	0.092243	10987.1080000	11376.3450000	0.8600004	-0.181658	9427.7580000	8070.8120000	0.7800005	-0.189240	18652.1040000	16254.5170000	0.8700006	-0.074186	17324.5880000	16248.7340000	0.9300007	-0.549843	22553.8360000	15412.6700000	0.9200008	-0.079499	16751.5370000	15635.8680000	0.8800009	0.302137	10351.9630000	12397.0750000	0.86000010	-0.448809	1268.5970000	778.3600000	0.08000011	0.160587	21492.4060000	24634.3550000	0.85000012	-0.188026	10473.8960000	8956.5110000	0.86000013	-0.057963	8007.1250000	7521.2900000	0.85000014	-0.108237	12493.1640000	11280.9330000	0.89000015	0.199785	11977.0160000	13353.0740000	0.83000016	0.000036	12742.5950000	12377.6110000	0.78000017	0.188663	17596.2870000	20072.5100000	0.91000018	-0.149510	13232.9010000	11623.2570000	0.86000019	-0.117583	11353.5640000	10188.7290000	0.86000020	-0.633083	40445.4340000	27308.2380000	0.420000!sample_table_end
