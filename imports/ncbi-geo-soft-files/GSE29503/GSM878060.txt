The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878060/suppl/GSM878060_602.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	-0.851429	180.1870000	196.4940000	0.0100002	-0.223332	1073.6140000	953.6260000	0.3800003	-0.026215	3879.1480000	3956.7260000	0.7400004	0.310763	3629.7630000	4652.7830000	0.6300005	0.567413	2783.9210000	4346.5540000	0.4700006	0.139745	3554.7460000	4083.8220000	0.7400007	0.145191	6406.2770000	7268.4450000	0.6300008	-0.107681	9215.7270000	8843.2710000	0.5000009	-0.476948	1299.7070000	982.9100000	0.27000010	0.362748	8252.2230000	11020.8900000	0.50000011	-0.325625	13050.2890000	10719.9460000	0.50000012	-0.355439	3731.4380000	3089.3490000	0.50000013	-0.429171	1586.4580000	1259.2410000	0.38000014	0.285952	693.8550000	863.0490000	0.38000015	-0.408242	1557.6220000	1253.6190000	0.72000016	-0.324673	2444.2210000	2092.9860000	0.67000017	0.000748	1122.7690000	1182.9630000	0.28000018	-0.366539	4677.7820000	3746.3080000	0.55000019	0.360141	1422.3020000	1958.8980000	0.51000020	0.033562	8192.1580000	8679.7090000	0.570000!sample_table_end
