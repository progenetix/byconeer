The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878032/suppl/GSM878032_513.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	-0.165743	159.6460000	37.2110000	0.0100002	0.310220	1667.5510000	1564.1920000	0.0100003	-0.057450	9845.2780000	7110.6070000	0.3300004	0.483694	19283.7500000	19920.6370000	0.7400005	0.544637	25569.5350000	28471.5640000	0.8100006	-0.222705	13294.0500000	8573.9290000	0.4600007	0.282381	45460.9380000	47043.9340000	0.6900008	0.075225	17114.1310000	13315.8510000	0.6400009	0.207250	2239.1630000	1952.4530000	0.01000010	0.039722	31043.3890000	24342.4940000	0.85000011	0.665039	21117.5250000	24948.6540000	0.87000012	-0.017596	9770.4640000	7289.4850000	0.35000013	0.364438	4233.5630000	4110.1050000	0.13000014	0.258619	2358.4550000	2122.7620000	0.01000015	0.504541	2762.7820000	2955.3220000	0.03000016	0.203712	8441.9450000	7336.8170000	0.41000017	0.524560	2751.6170000	2974.2390000	0.01000018	0.201960	9292.7700000	8075.9130000	0.34000019	0.105127	7301.7720000	5897.9220000	0.26000020	-0.180103	33444.1520000	22564.9690000	0.830000!sample_table_end
