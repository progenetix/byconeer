The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878051/suppl/GSM878051_596.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	1.123749	552.6250000	989.7720000	0.0200002	0.415636	1194.0370000	2003.4260000	0.2900003	-0.037995	5523.8710000	5818.5110000	0.6900004	0.162174	5012.1880000	6072.6630000	0.8300005	-0.053003	3109.4780000	3337.8180000	0.5500006	-0.108527	5206.9260000	5224.1880000	0.8100007	-0.040079	7573.4310000	8100.1610000	0.7800008	-0.293560	13479.2990000	11780.7880000	0.7700009	1.930057	376.5270000	874.6510000	0.04000010	-0.175255	11611.2520000	11181.3810000	0.71000011	0.520510	8359.4470000	13147.9120000	0.68000012	-0.269423	3444.1780000	3154.4490000	0.52000013	0.085533	1846.4840000	2355.4410000	0.32000014	0.639941	725.7360000	1318.3200000	0.16000015	0.490055	832.5750000	1467.8430000	0.23000016	0.152682	2253.4990000	2880.2280000	0.35000017	0.100703	1197.9310000	1635.4200000	0.19000018	-0.123834	3736.5780000	3754.2180000	0.60000019	-0.234042	3107.5900000	2962.3770000	0.53000020	-0.031303	14504.0380000	14853.6810000	0.500000!sample_table_end
