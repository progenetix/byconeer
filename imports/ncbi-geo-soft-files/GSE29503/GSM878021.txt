The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878021/suppl/GSM878021_368.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	-1.276475	316.7070000	24.6220000	0.0100002	0.590029	2032.2070000	2698.4970000	0.4200003	-0.054706	14367.7000000	13032.6520000	0.7600004	0.199108	6360.1610000	6626.7050000	0.8600005	0.001633	10241.9510000	9378.8850000	0.8600006	0.035588	17179.5490000	16751.3960000	0.8800007	0.049305	14699.8030000	14387.3940000	0.9100008	0.429470	504.4060000	332.6230000	0.0100009	-0.242132	5429.6460000	4129.4350000	0.86000010	0.414785	25504.3280000	33264.4840000	0.96000011	0.020976	26229.9530000	26081.9790000	0.92000012	-0.087020	16507.3550000	14705.4210000	0.97000013	0.087773	7338.1210000	7094.5420000	0.93000014	0.106619	5006.3110000	4852.5640000	0.78000015	0.556244	697.0740000	666.2430000	0.13000016	0.249356	8569.3190000	9278.2080000	0.64000017	0.105975	7800.9370000	7629.7700000	0.81000018	0.316483	7128.7990000	8055.4490000	0.89000019	0.244701	11903.7530000	13223.3720000	0.89000020	0.151878	12627.3590000	13131.2480000	0.890000!sample_table_end
