The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878062/suppl/GSM878062_609.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	-3.179674	183.5700000	44.8940000	0.0100002	0.134102	893.6510000	515.2860000	0.2500003	-0.045921	5935.0690000	2415.6910000	0.8500004	0.225612	4984.8950000	2485.9840000	0.6000005	-0.774276	5294.8890000	1355.8700000	0.7900006	-0.269926	6776.0830000	2337.4360000	0.8900007	-0.191694	5196.9410000	1963.1360000	0.8300008	-0.188223	16838.9630000	5080.9270000	0.8100009	-0.249789	1434.2030000	588.8110000	0.50000010	-0.064903	9472.6210000	3374.6000000	0.65000011	0.055383	8606.5260000	3397.1760000	0.83000012	-0.229668	6463.6030000	2317.9800000	0.74000013	0.616614	1877.2360000	1326.3030000	0.64000014	-0.469386	1371.7760000	494.7690000	0.49000015	0.357267	1199.5480000	747.3400000	0.66000016	0.469596	2967.3000000	1820.3200000	0.84000017	-0.593172	2640.7620000	808.6920000	0.69000018	-0.192717	3427.7470000	1340.5530000	0.88000019	-0.249908	3562.9870000	1336.4640000	0.79000020	0.265748	11019.7720000	4697.6090000	0.700000!sample_table_end
