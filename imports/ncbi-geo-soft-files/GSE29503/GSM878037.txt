The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878037/suppl/GSM878037_516.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	0.639398	386.8440000	394.5990000	0.0600002	0.509831	2370.0570000	2818.7660000	0.6400003	0.121466	12588.7930000	11006.4850000	0.8400004	0.175825	14017.9920000	12505.9200000	0.8400005	-0.076139	5919.1160000	4602.8190000	0.8800006	0.336062	12614.4950000	12663.1160000	0.9600007	0.197004	17057.4840000	15148.3040000	0.9200008	0.191114	30539.2270000	27616.8130000	0.5900009	0.197539	8039.6200000	7560.1190000	0.77000010	-0.075522	26801.0980000	19912.5160000	0.81000011	0.451744	23008.0920000	24623.2300000	0.79000012	0.020227	6414.5430000	5306.9350000	0.72000013	0.443005	3829.0240000	4293.8440000	0.67000014	0.381269	2609.6320000	2830.2110000	0.54000015	0.478069	3192.8360000	3697.1450000	0.86000016	0.316579	5405.0570000	5516.0990000	0.86000017	0.085824	3347.3390000	2948.4360000	0.66000018	0.584399	8904.7810000	10951.3830000	0.81000019	0.060038	5280.5740000	4515.1380000	0.73000020	0.281554	21879.9920000	20699.7540000	0.820000!sample_table_end
