The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878057/suppl/GSM878057_597.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	0.401611	750.8120000	769.5520000	0.4000002	0.372940	767.3220000	772.0480000	0.2500003	0.540768	4059.2390000	4441.8250000	0.7100004	0.244816	3622.5100000	3176.1910000	0.8500005	-0.063465	2750.7210000	1897.9600000	0.5100006	-0.161102	3651.8030000	2393.7500000	0.6900007	0.378340	6513.3940000	6340.9640000	0.8000008	-0.075608	9264.5280000	6453.6520000	0.7000009	0.294409	455.7820000	403.0710000	0.19000010	0.220879	10474.9420000	8874.8130000	0.50000011	0.499677	8879.1880000	9134.8370000	0.61000012	-0.204318	2968.1330000	1867.9100000	0.70000013	0.736471	1473.5550000	1785.9720000	0.39000014	0.238118	743.9630000	684.6640000	0.21000015	0.797061	1002.1400000	1302.4820000	0.60000016	0.202780	1939.5210000	1622.3700000	0.62000017	0.155632	849.5800000	733.4960000	0.20000018	0.509566	2879.8860000	2995.0150000	0.77000019	-0.174792	1788.5400000	1160.9840000	0.51000020	-0.285773	10865.8010000	6495.1080000	0.730000!sample_table_end
