The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878045/suppl/GSM878045_521.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	0.443739	435.6160000	456.2240000	0.1100002	0.194061	3162.2850000	3343.4110000	0.6400003	0.276884	19733.8750000	21406.1860000	0.7300004	0.319250	14430.0080000	15994.7290000	0.8200005	-0.459400	10033.1040000	6440.6500000	0.7900006	0.528322	15307.7250000	19607.9750000	0.7300007	0.354026	21587.4900000	24901.5630000	0.7900008	0.090266	37944.5740000	37788.4180000	0.8200009	0.383827	1987.4240000	2441.1470000	0.35000010	0.399898	28534.2090000	34788.4220000	0.82000011	0.210752	30230.6990000	32329.7810000	0.82000012	0.346037	17312.1190000	19514.7910000	0.76000013	0.480457	5945.9130000	7288.2500000	0.68000014	0.456515	3939.2500000	4872.9590000	0.85000015	0.262560	4425.7960000	4771.6040000	0.84000016	0.484519	8675.8980000	10708.7710000	0.81000017	0.449377	4933.5320000	5972.4300000	0.51000018	0.431407	9587.3330000	11462.7740000	0.69000019	0.538689	10596.5660000	13703.4360000	0.61000020	0.267928	36397.7810000	41203.4410000	0.750000!sample_table_end
