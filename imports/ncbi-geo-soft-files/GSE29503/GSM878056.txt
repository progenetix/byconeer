The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878056/suppl/GSM878056_594.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	0.203781	364.3900000	298.9180000	0.1500002	0.207129	661.0470000	637.0950000	0.2200003	-0.269730	3827.2970000	2347.5130000	0.7000004	-0.215154	4425.8500000	2886.3990000	0.8000005	-0.532786	3207.2560000	1593.2540000	0.6000006	0.005605	4809.4730000	3742.1280000	0.8000007	0.483349	6439.8460000	6970.3420000	0.7800008	-0.021927	10831.8860000	8272.5840000	0.5600009	0.333356	686.8930000	712.8240000	0.18000010	-0.130357	12795.7860000	9215.3000000	0.50000011	0.174835	11150.5900000	9883.1970000	0.76000012	-0.488155	3615.5370000	1875.2730000	0.75000013	0.237505	1632.1360000	1396.5030000	0.55000014	-0.050628	1004.1810000	764.6500000	0.34000015	0.372111	1374.3400000	1303.7040000	0.69000016	0.101098	2412.2870000	1857.6610000	0.77000017	-0.447476	1355.1400000	760.5470000	0.39000018	0.173090	4075.1470000	3514.4260000	0.71000019	-0.368274	2796.8930000	1556.7370000	0.54000020	-0.006319	13571.1920000	10745.6130000	0.540000!sample_table_end
