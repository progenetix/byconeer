The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878035/suppl/GSM878035_522.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	1.094298	212.9010000	210.4180000	0.0200002	0.505829	1806.1880000	2211.2240000	0.6400003	0.619461	7898.7420000	9933.6410000	0.8800004	0.379408	8569.9410000	9148.1280000	0.8900005	-0.008537	4521.2510000	3684.6180000	0.8800006	0.137712	9968.9720000	8930.2180000	0.9400007	0.389185	12225.2510000	12673.2260000	0.9500008	0.358088	14274.7690000	14388.5730000	0.7500009	0.070860	911.0960000	833.6660000	0.32000010	0.305162	17941.1460000	17537.8960000	0.73000011	0.193077	18941.5920000	17142.5180000	0.86000012	0.283735	4370.6560000	4359.7650000	0.53000013	0.385092	1455.5810000	1665.8000000	0.53000014	0.067553	1493.1640000	1379.6300000	0.34000015	0.200609	1930.0920000	1911.3490000	0.79000016	0.420310	3174.3360000	3522.5640000	0.83000017	0.141450	1325.2160000	1294.2750000	0.34000018	0.765254	5171.3760000	7191.8760000	0.71000019	0.045375	3365.4790000	2883.9460000	0.70000020	0.218483	15292.5710000	13969.6510000	0.670000!sample_table_end
