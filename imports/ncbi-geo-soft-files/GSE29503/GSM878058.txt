The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878058/suppl/GSM878058_588.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	0.675120	271.7420000	175.9840000	0.1300002	2.602559	89.0620000	116.8530000	0.0500003	0.626609	377.2720000	331.3770000	0.2000004	-0.165145	539.9230000	287.0570000	0.3400005	0.817669	214.8170000	118.0060000	0.0500006	-0.086331	396.8690000	178.4280000	0.1600007	0.308112	658.4600000	514.9940000	0.3800008	-0.202146	1129.7840000	609.7770000	0.4900009	0.970183	179.3140000	92.1910000	0.02000010	-0.256128	1411.3030000	716.3840000	0.65000011	0.547329	1193.8630000	1050.7010000	0.63000012	0.286355	339.5150000	190.3240000	0.07000013	1.291234	185.3400000	145.4050000	0.05000014	1.482729	158.7160000	125.0200000	0.06000015	1.405389	175.5230000	144.9790000	0.06000016	1.367170	209.3620000	213.1050000	0.07000017	1.571775	131.4970000	89.2240000	0.04000018	-0.115286	471.9290000	243.5870000	0.14000019	0.808697	233.0890000	141.8200000	0.08000020	-0.731985	1253.8430000	470.5190000	0.360000!sample_table_end
