The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878025/suppl/GSM878025_424.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	-0.500180	309.3410000	114.6870000	0.0500002	0.589294	2154.8190000	2777.7150000	0.6800003	0.456871	13894.5450000	12230.7480000	0.8500004	0.760572	6303.2780000	7631.8410000	0.6700005	0.384452	11413.4470000	9884.5550000	0.6800006	0.813529	10985.4910000	12520.8130000	0.5200007	0.593668	11867.3640000	11601.9570000	0.7600008	0.549775	19363.5530000	17967.2340000	0.6800009	0.357591	3456.5830000	3554.7870000	0.76000010	0.640422	17957.0040000	17682.0430000	0.50000011	0.589872	18999.8960000	18063.6720000	0.74000012	0.093140	12562.6870000	8905.3560000	0.82000013	0.999474	5783.8880000	8231.6040000	0.90000014	0.422714	1509.2090000	1806.5380000	0.22000015	0.231232	934.9430000	975.4490000	0.38000016	0.817879	4239.8550000	5655.2900000	0.68000017	0.252006	2961.1560000	2927.2120000	0.58000018	0.868380	8127.9690000	10136.9850000	0.69000019	0.586744	6923.2330000	7380.1750000	0.69000020	0.580222	22706.0610000	21570.7230000	0.620000!sample_table_end
