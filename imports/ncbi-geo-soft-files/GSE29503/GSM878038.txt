The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878038/suppl/GSM878038_525.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	0.404161	449.1250000	327.3870000	0.0700002	0.323757	1282.5120000	1237.3150000	0.3900003	-0.251983	9589.2960000	6391.0570000	0.8800004	-0.062158	9049.3510000	6870.9560000	0.8900005	-0.256426	5079.1560000	3366.1900000	0.8400006	-0.012748	9146.2250000	7226.7660000	0.9100007	0.286595	13913.6500000	13120.7620000	0.8700008	-0.257597	19972.8220000	12824.7600000	0.8200009	0.501488	1036.5830000	1091.9980000	0.23000010	0.030699	17560.8180000	13796.1790000	0.84000011	0.205206	18620.5020000	16355.8810000	0.83000012	-0.109292	7818.2870000	5732.5190000	0.83000013	0.398392	2298.6220000	2427.7030000	0.69000014	0.164151	1847.8430000	1649.1200000	0.41000015	0.598903	1771.8040000	2141.9570000	0.68000016	0.203626	4363.6840000	3990.4350000	0.74000017	0.048843	2142.3130000	1777.2550000	0.51000018	0.022640	5517.5320000	4435.1500000	0.76000019	-0.059337	3987.4610000	3040.7010000	0.79000020	-0.212486	18323.2970000	12133.2430000	0.940000!sample_table_end
