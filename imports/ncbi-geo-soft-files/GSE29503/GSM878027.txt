The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878027/suppl/GSM878027_503.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	-0.331818	581.3680000	345.8010000	0.0400002	0.396336	4219.4480000	3622.1610000	0.8000003	0.028903	24986.5210000	13894.6980000	0.8800004	0.171544	20761.4240000	13167.0920000	0.9100005	-0.446742	16004.7410000	7140.7580000	0.8800006	-0.142381	20887.7050000	10918.8280000	0.9000007	0.116141	24752.7770000	14533.2160000	0.8900008	-0.123095	50208.3950000	23720.8690000	0.8500009	-0.031014	3526.5420000	2295.4270000	0.66000010	-0.110072	43504.2070000	20537.4300000	0.81000011	0.147586	49717.2420000	28744.0000000	0.67000012	-0.017465	19003.7830000	10959.7760000	0.86000013	0.570882	9223.7960000	8445.2580000	0.91000014	0.128463	4250.2130000	3053.7200000	0.76000015	0.398692	5169.9640000	4398.4900000	0.91000016	0.209821	10353.2570000	7378.1960000	0.93000017	0.198559	5535.0730000	4099.0470000	0.83000018	0.337358	3906.1750000	3242.4440000	0.70000019	0.082471	10171.2770000	6660.2300000	0.79000020	-0.155032	48888.4920000	22488.6890000	0.570000!sample_table_end
