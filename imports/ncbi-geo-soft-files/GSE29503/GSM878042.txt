The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878042/suppl/GSM878042_523.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	0.375821	325.0320000	261.6010000	0.0400002	0.669356	1189.7870000	1680.2560000	0.2000003	0.472930	7923.5950000	10412.7880000	0.6600004	0.007009	7957.1550000	7498.4250000	0.8000005	-0.203074	3200.2970000	2580.8480000	0.5900006	0.319010	8716.2930000	10323.3760000	0.8400007	-0.000453	13275.8310000	12698.9710000	0.7800008	0.156622	16329.0040000	17018.9100000	0.5800009	0.363305	1931.5260000	2301.8660000	0.36000010	-0.192034	17266.9920000	14218.0030000	0.71000011	0.431455	21967.5780000	27205.0210000	0.94000012	-0.121969	12213.3610000	10703.7190000	0.77000013	0.196665	2899.5870000	3092.4440000	0.63000014	-0.133597	1991.1720000	1660.0570000	0.43000015	0.106446	3417.0180000	3412.2900000	0.72000016	0.258473	5977.4080000	6656.7130000	0.85000017	-0.510785	2878.4140000	1880.4840000	0.54000018	0.567806	5463.7010000	7553.0520000	0.56000019	-0.351719	4709.7710000	3436.5640000	0.61000020	-0.263153	20467.2420000	15823.1440000	0.740000!sample_table_end
