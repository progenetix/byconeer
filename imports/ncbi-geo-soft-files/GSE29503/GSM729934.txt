The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers.!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse confidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall.
