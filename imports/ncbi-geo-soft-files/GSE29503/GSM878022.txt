The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878022/suppl/GSM878022_374.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	0.461984	170.7920000	46.4560000	0.0100002	0.290468	1030.3450000	905.1620000	0.4000003	-0.297537	8641.9770000	5600.6500000	0.9000004	0.251024	3729.4870000	3604.1370000	0.8000005	-0.129735	7252.6730000	5288.5870000	0.9100006	0.071005	6945.4400000	5850.0300000	0.8500007	-0.067886	7781.7890000	5938.0290000	0.9300008	-0.001224	330.0340000	98.0460000	0.0100009	-0.186005	2686.4480000	1914.2390000	0.71000010	-0.083370	16770.4920000	12987.1680000	0.91000011	0.062989	13941.9480000	11879.2350000	0.58000012	-0.267371	8660.9710000	5731.1700000	0.83000013	0.060030	3736.9900000	3158.7300000	0.83000014	-0.174747	2204.5950000	1566.6010000	0.73000015	1.220989	352.8220000	364.3340000	0.06000016	0.001500	4172.0020000	3377.6410000	0.80000017	0.205453	4451.7020000	4133.0950000	0.91000018	0.836560	3678.4550000	5297.7940000	0.85000019	-0.116809	6020.8530000	4467.9960000	0.81000020	0.033292	5733.8020000	4712.3300000	0.810000!sample_table_end
