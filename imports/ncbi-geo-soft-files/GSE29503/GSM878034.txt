The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878034/suppl/GSM878034_517.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	-1.672638	212.4680000	10.7410000	0.0100002	0.116965	1434.0660000	1265.0620000	0.3600003	-0.083184	7771.5500000	6210.4520000	0.9200004	-0.079878	8894.2610000	7168.2120000	0.9000005	-0.157559	5108.1580000	3845.4070000	0.8600006	-0.207545	3903.1590000	2838.8680000	0.8200007	0.089340	10393.7030000	9513.3860000	0.9600008	-0.232784	12333.5690000	9009.8640000	0.8800009	0.460444	1093.1540000	1192.1320000	0.25000010	-0.079682	18443.8300000	15276.9690000	0.91000011	0.223552	15969.4130000	16326.6400000	0.92000012	-0.218773	5880.9450000	4236.1120000	0.62000013	0.226894	1946.8010000	1904.4480000	0.37000014	0.146306	1236.3290000	1081.3940000	0.30000015	0.373222	1678.1330000	1806.3060000	0.56000016	0.282676	3537.0710000	3618.5420000	0.77000017	0.025909	1372.6980000	1120.3670000	0.21000018	0.059375	5717.1450000	5025.4850000	0.85000019	-0.171453	2950.0710000	2205.2110000	0.46000020	-0.080126	16407.4180000	13505.0960000	0.750000!sample_table_end
