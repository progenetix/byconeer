The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878018/suppl/GSM878018_359.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	0.408977	448.0140000	406.5640000	0.0100002	0.531541	2359.0330000	3111.8480000	0.8000003	0.428181	15864.4670000	16947.0660000	0.8800004	-0.079134	5764.6170000	4751.3810000	0.9500005	0.038960	11923.6410000	10092.6600000	0.9600006	-0.454437	23593.3380000	13613.4090000	0.8300007	0.002393	15798.3930000	12733.6220000	0.8300008	3.255131	98.7220000	404.2050000	0.0100009	0.117922	4639.7360000	4408.9740000	0.90000010	-0.227100	35477.6520000	23708.7150000	0.98000011	0.323000	29081.9340000	28453.1720000	0.87000012	0.195444	16655.5570000	15194.2850000	0.88000013	0.430837	8203.4620000	9272.9470000	0.95000014	0.157151	3079.5100000	3104.0480000	0.82000015	0.009432	651.2210000	518.1510000	0.04000016	0.158830	11426.4900000	10509.8960000	0.75000017	-0.128478	6712.2090000	5289.0630000	0.86000018	0.308989	9990.0070000	10269.6880000	0.81000019	0.331263	13981.5620000	14125.8800000	0.90000020	0.167474	17189.6930000	15397.9830000	0.820000!sample_table_end
