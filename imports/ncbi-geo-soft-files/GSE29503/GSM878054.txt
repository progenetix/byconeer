The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878054/suppl/GSM878054_590.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	0.785002	884.6570000	1564.2050000	0.4000002	0.210602	1096.8800000	1296.2850000	0.3000003	0.574297	7930.6210000	10893.1280000	0.8400004	0.061732	7268.7340000	7175.1060000	0.8000005	-0.677750	4856.2790000	2753.4900000	0.7100006	-0.126553	7943.2860000	6851.2070000	0.8800007	-0.363636	13145.8660000	9299.8220000	0.8800008	-0.489479	19608.1210000	12818.4300000	0.8500009	-0.184097	1241.8930000	1119.2310000	0.23000010	-0.003115	21005.1270000	19788.5290000	0.65000011	0.037484	17753.5940000	16930.3130000	0.67000012	-0.108463	6461.4350000	5653.1570000	0.86000013	0.630763	2353.6840000	3267.0940000	0.57000014	-0.098964	1444.2240000	1322.7710000	0.34000015	0.293035	1835.2470000	2054.1500000	0.63000016	0.042926	5412.7250000	5220.8850000	0.73000017	-0.424097	1643.7280000	1192.2080000	0.36000018	0.260775	5749.1950000	6520.7670000	0.70000019	-0.640483	4918.3560000	2869.3510000	0.81000020	-0.604505	19729.7030000	11852.1400000	0.700000!sample_table_end
