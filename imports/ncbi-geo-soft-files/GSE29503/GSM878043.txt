The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878043/suppl/GSM878043_511.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	0.417850	300.9830000	277.7510000	0.0300002	0.220801	1451.0950000	1511.8940000	0.4600003	-0.131079	8552.8640000	6774.2530000	0.9100004	0.354205	8640.2690000	9699.7580000	0.9600005	-0.079791	4967.5010000	4042.4890000	0.8000006	-0.284535	7683.9380000	5423.9460000	0.9300007	0.400098	11974.9140000	13966.4200000	0.9700008	0.246602	19236.2790000	20233.3030000	0.9200009	0.478528	1444.6380000	1804.8490000	0.47000010	0.152607	14942.4480000	14705.9760000	0.85000011	0.053207	17538.6310000	16071.4440000	0.84000012	0.090602	8873.3240000	8236.6440000	0.96000013	0.252526	2325.7110000	2460.3020000	0.61000014	0.223079	1388.6130000	1453.6630000	0.44000015	-0.168014	2206.5280000	1755.9920000	0.71000016	-0.087124	4305.1550000	3507.2610000	0.85000017	-0.207669	2252.0370000	1747.4990000	0.41000018	-0.076089	4356.6510000	3569.6730000	0.79000019	-0.149326	4263.5560000	3325.8780000	0.78000020	-0.290133	14732.8170000	10636.4330000	0.960000!sample_table_end
