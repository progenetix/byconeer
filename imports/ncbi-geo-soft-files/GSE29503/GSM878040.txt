The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanner - ScanArray Express; Collection software - ScanArray Express, Microarray Analysis System 3.0.0.16; Resolution - 5 micrometers!Sample_description = Malignant ovarian tumour!Sample_data_processing = Spot identification and signal extraction using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome, Cambridge UK); spots are filtered using a BlueFuse onfidence score > 0.3; spatial normalisation using MANOR; signal normalisation using LIMMA; segmentation using DNAcopy; copy number status calling using CGHcall; MANOR, LIMMA, DNAcopy and CGHcall are all Bioconductor packages (www.bioconductor.org)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Jones!Sample_contact_email = c.jones@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 44 2076799204!Sample_contact_laboratory = Translational Research Laboratories!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = WC1E!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM878nnn/GSM878040/suppl/GSM878040_524.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29503!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, following spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Alexa 3 Reference#CH2_SIG = Alexa 5 Test#CONFIDENCE = BlueFuse signal confidence estimate!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	-0.351952	580.2660000	401.9160000	0.0800002	0.156247	2046.9940000	2802.4950000	0.5400003	-0.124283	15888.8160000	17176.3590000	0.8200004	0.014472	12695.6350000	15312.9610000	0.8600005	-0.271820	8117.9660000	8175.2940000	0.7700006	-0.308647	14994.1430000	14466.5830000	0.9500007	-0.095239	21496.2250000	23461.1000000	0.8600008	-0.128908	27784.1390000	29591.9360000	0.7000009	0.172451	2453.3620000	3403.4020000	0.70000010	-0.414988	24910.0350000	21730.2620000	0.82000011	-0.006426	32110.0550000	37385.2150000	0.76000012	-0.033881	13050.5390000	15292.2710000	0.80000013	0.054443	6538.9270000	8299.9040000	0.74000014	0.257247	3957.7040000	5795.5260000	0.87000015	-0.165111	4023.1780000	4428.1980000	0.84000016	-0.040077	7812.1220000	9228.2010000	0.79000017	-0.005398	3709.9750000	4546.9850000	0.48000018	-0.031758	10329.3320000	12200.1290000	0.70000019	-0.302738	8017.2090000	7940.4420000	0.69000020	-0.159249	29903.9590000	31190.3050000	0.950000!sample_table_end
