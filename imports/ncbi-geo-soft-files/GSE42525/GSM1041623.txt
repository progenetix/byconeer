First, the apt-probeset-genotype program in Affymetrix Power Tools (APT) was used to generate genotyping calls from the raw CEL files using the Birdseed v2 algorithm. The APT software apt-probeset-summarize program was then used to extract allele-specific signal values for each SNP, after applying quantile normalisation and median polish on the data. the Log R Ratio (LRR) values and the B Allele Frequency (BAF) values were subsequently calculated using PennCNA. The reference set we used to generate LRR and BAF values for each DNA samples was indeed the HapMap project DNA samples, which pennCNA provides as its default clustering file for the following calculation.!Sample_data_processing = VALUE: Log R ratio against the reference set; VALUE2: B Allele Frequency!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Jun,,Wang!Sample_contact_email = j.a.wang@qmul.ac.uk!Sample_contact_institute = Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary, London!Sample_contact_address = Charterhouse Square!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = EC1M 6BQ!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1041nnn/GSM1041623/suppl/GSM1041623_SN4_tFL.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE42525!Sample_data_row_count = 1851567
