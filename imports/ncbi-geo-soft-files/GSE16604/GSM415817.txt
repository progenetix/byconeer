DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415817/suppl/GSM415817_KC0213.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415817/suppl/GSM415817_KC0214.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16604!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2827.423231105834	3772.555551222667	3201.47152061872	3289.421891952051	1.461922095388613	1.472666083034515	.9927043966248184	0.0364	1.0255759007272982	1163.429824262152	1595.241944545556	1337.449002536022	1405.705166164175	.654792997103415	.7157106623547222	.914885066751856	-0.0906	.93913000292831643	2684.508365884172	4030.519876131172	3043.528870857012	3513.469226405215	1.455821460258366	1.664078955032181	.8748511937224833	-0.2258	.85509656862203384	8838.484669312094	10238.54990592919	9569.473210105645	8931.851339105444	4.780484333008688	4.449578083673652	1.074368005935033	0.1587	1.1162957849731055	8548.64799143398	10977.68386895429	9257.004577828784	9604.96891709996	4.303242742364052	4.672924239660105	.9208886174189413	0.0529	1.037369280163396	6893.542485860945	9301.130054017389	7540.317158814494	8126.505605461504	3.874336115630764	4.257373176689544	.9100297189929162	-0.0097	.99330329195591167	2289.030850592286	2998.077042484922	2603.89607910088	2619.089101998598	1.176191799624033	1.214482441273822	.9684716383304584	0.1138	1.0821095006221858	1190.540573215439	1627.31692914808	1367.773177621018	1432.203665010224	.6497926673604235	.7067403860654327	.9194220114941378	-0.0353	.97584252081007189	1460.059259504218	1965.164747258815	1671.551635286978	1722.276817867622	.7601493889235061	.8175052599490277	.9298403645389416	-0.0102	.992949602138817610	9565.318781451637	11642.4294398749	10279.70866276938	10166.3894202058	4.775462021783878	4.896769014504408	.9752271360235256	-0.0244	.983210999038154811	5002.978632560902	7339.742752488773	5542.988569656942	6403.075867321156	2.658765196700126	3.185589645453016	.8346226264563427	-0.0879	.9408988450657112	22101.76012154913	28543.44895891243	20502.7431950287	24422.58545532671	10.79186193522371	12.68044198961398	.8510635468434681	-0.0589	.960000081231147613	3119.984571535832	5236.644349560607	3521.458839326295	4561.072151937075	1.712769426390416	2.178422790738985	.7862428880526882	-0.2228	.85688791926784814	6624.414283964286	8443.871762360952	7256.938229225914	7375.011899123669	3.415872712086614	3.500999147450428	.9756851025154328	0.0142	1.00992132979099415	1567.15412167168	1827.363670167621	1793.359945371342	1604.201789060432	.8222920483883841	.7863995549528665	1.045641548509865	0.1217	1.08801234326940816	2532.764439017175	3291.324365850516	2874.804273061256	2873.426935544926	1.268186424322993	1.368357482927445	.926794671820592	-0.0376	.974254869177954817	245.224441545933	316.2406267372842	281.7215267688056	293.1923299078906	.150815450222123	.1836681571738532	.8211300888665579	-0.0028	.998063593814820818	4107.349387644374	5019.511905983222	4586.968933782583	4375.146850243821	2.31130014416172	2.403727928311284	.9615481506617523	0.1082	1.07785201506334519	1187.811163862332	1763.203712110585	1364.979704877349	1548.259661059028	.5949396966867465	.6714930456185262	.8859953212750479	-0.0775	.947705843718225720	1944.774021780918	2703.342287913176	2218.833901396305	2361.609800756131	.992302188489702	1.083447706894711	.9158745569121722	-0.0629	.9573462660944614!sample_table_end
