DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415816/suppl/GSM415816_KC0225.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415816/suppl/GSM415816_KC0226.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16604!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3524.315224342615	5373.260269491571	3921.893691651094	4808.555646757161	1.564477366103667	1.861391462767688	.8404880958127194	-0.0074	.99485906761081852	1810.900677587775	1519.822137024853	2033.712466737404	1370.164292428878	.8208316712503977	.5766822047056708	1.42336917032031	0.1355	1.0984839036425543	4241.118099610647	5132.386926437724	4695.815180124595	4592.625333123236	1.649222320202394	1.719474688790029	.9591431214163024	-0.0499	.96599632310791064	14081.18593819928	15405.29235689499	14566.98293597018	13951.96629711186	5.316647185797414	4.962354324669684	1.071396123280922	0.0251	1.0175268762342965	11502.55230698352	12877.6991759732	12130.31687965619	11663.39247252147	4.666104660755944	4.589557217299991	1.016678611864215	0.1379	1.1002886900020426	10200.42662872494	13732.02036228388	10872.11483439126	12442.85586120036	4.24093066949079	4.888999171772245	.8674435238150118	-0.1907	.87619049637774587	2757.083561758654	3750.905694770755	3077.480955246349	3352.039058548952	1.14979861415521	1.321045991671976	.8703698594929108	-0.1546	.89837203908969748	1420.323990046688	1981.605250033156	1599.193318727605	1777.140739129117	.6360094885909418	.6970391578548552	.9124444178262054	-0.2095	.86485867571984689	1983.031469002801	3135.173273363606	2224.191572466016	2799.987691590139	.8078190099026266	1.060852024614655	.7614813293079776	-0.2275	.854110504341533310	11137.71933304376	12693.94894272794	11797.7064092561	11497.97524607892	4.160939144562141	4.18720722503615	.9937265869439306	-0.1303	.913636712832843211	5780.806571752188	6826.832183406169	6325.542278225923	6132.346765057433	2.266381275085756	2.252646521690562	1.006097163164724	-0.1025	.93139173683284412	27991.26350913378	38827.69143405622	25818.10114145662	34805.43492501652	9.821150306364853	13.27855598272312	.7396248748089219	-0.2301	.852568745346955713	3300.436438377254	4331.622091316719	3676.135182395932	3873.254377469303	1.42870706793988	1.497496367385624	.954063795449576	-0.0621	.957900444147327614	7747.827849188744	9096.123253417005	8385.836020887104	8220.920272350588	2.940334511725112	3.035533330332276	.9686385197435	-0.1919	.875445457784029715	1439.144673418688	1633.748108395458	1619.774636038364	1470.039174429662	.6088507375058322	.5612883215527196	1.084737939712586	0.1428	1.10404751931685416	2792.879793577184	3382.08300553054	3119.724701008948	3020.74838023772	1.069936149593544	1.088978502392487	.9825135640812864	0.0419	1.02947581388754517	312.8769397810186	286.6406114645724	345.7045511114526	270.1789121892308	.1224943858249943	.1033793632429778	1.184901724893482	0.1195	1.08633633983706918	5703.176370916149	7257.41873199046	6245.838952938588	6526.854712947682	2.31971749369633	2.620744993383202	.8851366689827128	-0.1017	.931927391133689819	1423.396874069483	2041.834446841369	1602.641108778696	1828.756089285458	.5655107069478592	.6423064447852288	.8804375412065993	-0.0466	.968241066943567220	2205.962769546313	2781.572848813844	2471.23115163449	2484.349638964872	.8998908729939823	.9423986555775926	.954894054302786	-0.1404	.9072933043193344!sample_table_end
