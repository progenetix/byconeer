DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415815/suppl/GSM415815_KC0221.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415815/suppl/GSM415815_KC0222.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16604!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1703.415671539925	2838.902755814866	1881.746952510699	2514.114748909924	1.751828647253037	2.262174194240651	.7744004204950613	-0.3105	.80635740845272152	722.670049256166	745.7746687361031	814.288021685746	668.7185211581092	.6387178807912254	.5168180329995563	1.235866088271292	-0.1811	.88204323114714463	2807.051842503123	3189.979542948434	3067.167742362834	2822.795455739916	2.60428423035306	2.247506509937427	1.158743798444244	0.1201	1.0868301112929024	4338.92641861504	4753.341673246297	4694.024769985249	4213.007351088622	5.936963931901452	5.189732489673671	1.143982651073942	0.1408	1.102521341137255	7588.332047348591	9615.558135853575	8100.764016900291	8566.842658147742	6.3150946000012	6.783665373011525	.9309266086628462	-0.0087	.9940149599434396	6869.108937671029	11757.31042305136	7350.499268659261	10498.93549953089	6.449494521948092	8.919322411504924	.7230924306121023	-0.2023	.8691754538936647	1090.321535249276	1831.919668064195	1214.351015892341	1623.381746607011	1.093713534865279	1.435338054422874	.7619902025833516	-0.3899	.76316459259973118	937.4959562126842	1023.846371912978	1050.200195962416	913.584196530028	.9312599785963794	.7567124904401935	1.230665530649096	0.2152	1.1608585360952869	1782.387496607056	2542.657251088098	1968.821492139652	2251.67166519673	1.549162726601895	1.776361249490248	.872098919657502	-0.0197	.986412929304717210	8296.051658460447	8951.156496798929	8813.361409178528	7968.112628481602	8.9884253809457	8.755019870001	1.026659620927242	0.0961	1.06891074926340711	4269.034830669432	6193.966659723065	4615.287756948851	5493.449569775707	4.791735319675003	5.730624758189492	.8361628132826621	-0.0904	.93925338326082212	13432.356765367	19209.19947707858	14004.66940509635	17244.76340054147	18.91415936130517	22.85381583586732	.8276149373541747	-0.1533	.899212211611494113	2737.417831211887	3266.590911839134	2989.442837628827	2892.111620739918	3.527909932876098	3.335439869549386	1.057704551979441	0.0361	1.0253676550722814	6894.659398938096	7980.526024938266	7372.721138130548	7093.012308476182	9.68620448845947	9.270732391736049	1.044815455690833	0.0919	1.06576457301613615	1052.488043593615	1241.783337653131	1173.246995223704	1104.726758299441	.8771520092359312	.853348284075635	1.027894501699363	0.0513	1.03621792706381516	2222.454437281292	3029.631996558386	2444.466305216118	2682.340629841498	1.942903669083102	2.156186631368816	.9010832554182406	0.0170	1.01187296159802917	204.968864020491	196.3334470668072	244.0854043308934	169.2515048812638	.1869050520915136	.1324590645775175	1.411040102749127	0.3997	1.31925106979656918	2991.518308250754	3906.724239786585	3265.82972155058	3457.30732264989	3.293198525338196	3.541202688196032	.929966120356648	-0.0451	.96921255274965619	941.159652972855	1283.788083180222	1051.025671355892	1141.26130268001	.9128254233738786	.9906684367294946	.9214237473714212	-0.0562	.961803760363891120	1732.602776145526	2152.257700501814	1915.027476156827	1906.251668145381	1.404514195906826	1.449230047850918	.9691450974188655	-0.0241	.9834338364753268!sample_table_end
