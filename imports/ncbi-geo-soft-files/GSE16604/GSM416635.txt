DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416635/suppl/GSM416635_KC0217.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416635/suppl/GSM416635_KC0218.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16604!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3195.055759174722	3971.381401628523	3468.417143413756	3617.489106331266	1.55073508852764	1.644019394377605	.943258390887	-0.0479	.96734498884447782	2592.975729673485	2599.012939758967	2826.993089081044	2363.600182055002	1.195435184389411	1.082484456295998	1.104343972272732	0.0072	1.0050108387729353	4384.68166124369	4738.995859996724	4713.6422532289	4319.676000244237	2.003150366731146	1.905288746977067	1.051363143727871	0.1571	1.1150239346156014	11489.70822855635	11426.5017445313	11822.62590286056	10628.41388662193	5.081885567069987	4.97547300304964	1.02138742667383	-0.0510	.96524062145312285	9796.935856570002	10940.69152528605	10095.05469838882	10157.29433509463	4.263420471512026	4.564589133516774	.9340206416841919	0.0334	1.0233928015660126	6441.019313917958	9089.452656787676	6802.933827866579	8397.460230246632	3.155219386933518	3.858930655332452	.8176408618728321	-0.2212	.85782697846010477	2091.102211925886	3719.214025532837	2290.844620586371	3384.830068812315	.9433772460289322	1.4464860048596	.6521855329810116	-0.4193	.74777569761153538	1236.968978530244	1367.828782291896	1368.725402237092	1256.134317455311	.6093957115535139	.5719955657661486	1.065385377135346	0.0620	1.043917716695899	1874.562229191329	2449.24356823456	2058.549091408661	2228.281998186117	.8983123606547349	.943227146045053	.9523817931039776	0.0332	1.02327752001680610	14001.46164232723	14745.39422394916	14338.45214444272	13778.04051870449	5.847144721973041	5.895661889732024	.9917707004461228	0.0060	1.00420222988888811	8757.609501203897	8786.906082380912	9084.721861568984	8113.966038237391	3.923352173053997	3.443688261262868	1.139287843556207	0.2051	1.15274643861075812	33233.18482122874	31291.8756185253	31902.5796419848	29090.27315787422	14.55252284581027	12.99985659674381	1.119437182826722	-0.0542	.963112874785550413	4740.774427261077	4208.04504432505	5082.147702420434	3833.265135270416	2.14308026121803	1.725252099923242	1.242183830011496	0.3127	1.2420147091595514	10345.23956197869	9557.956410318822	10631.13829792751	8829.629721837959	4.626821289893726	4.041285640530039	1.144888459130765	0.1326	1.09626302230894915	2562.509204331194	2945.4062829026	2794.885442491056	2679.779297506652	1.185019119827664	1.13923815440339	1.040185597056525	0.1382	1.10049837664584416	3778.696532159033	4593.172828242106	4082.927249537846	4185.094898078712	1.772523419454536	1.757886986692906	1.008326151153303	0.0048	1.00329870462385317	361.4838962363333	442.8415546991359	413.208277152269	418.7165221357687	.1964961525490019	.1874374432785005	1.04832924047647	0.0982	1.07047181378618918	4386.794687689656	6370.866015727028	4715.60709979588	5830.240674021404	2.048868123603325	2.629997775239598	.7790379683559502	-0.1978	.871904149143214219	1754.628076599312	1778.083007073287	1928.602863895456	1623.053372675447	.7817481869489468	.6947505090087581	1.125221467004484	0.2703	1.2060395938434720	1240.955820589085	1460.912510697784	1374.808610441443	1339.069059021904	.6261585425003898	.6045223171299167	1.035790614767037	0.0100	1.006934375514942!sample_table_end
