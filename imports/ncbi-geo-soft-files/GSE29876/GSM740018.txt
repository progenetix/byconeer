The genomic DNA used to analyze copy number alterations on the SNP6.0 arrays was processed per manufacterer's instructions. The GAPF assay was performed with 50% formamide as described (Diede et al. 2010a). Two micrograms of genomic DNA from cells were split evenly and digested with 10 U of SbfI, KpnI or PmeI (NEB) for at least eight hours at 37Â°C in a volume of 20 Î¼L. The restriction enzymes were heat inactivated by incubation at 65Â°C for 20 minutes. The digests were then combined into one tube. To the mixture was added 3 Î¼L of 3 M NaCl (final concentration of 100 mM), 45 Î¼L of formamide (final concentration of 50%), and 2 Î¼L of water. This mixture was heated to 99Â°C in a thermocycler for 7 minutes to denature the DNA, and then rapidly cooled in a ice-water bath for 3 minutes leading to the formation of âsnap-backâ DNA. S1 digestion was performed by adding 100 U of S1 nuclease (2 Î¼L of 100 U/Î¼L solution; Invitrogen), 12 Î¼L of 10x S1 nuclease buffer, and 8 Î¼L of 3 M NaCl. The sample was incubated at 37Â°C for 60 minutes. S1 nuclease was extracted with phenol:chloroform, and the DNA was ethanol precipitated in the presence of 20 ug glycogen. The DNA pellet was resuspended in 80 Î¼L of 1/10 TE. The DNA was split equally between two tubes and digested with 40 U of MseI (NEB) or 40 U of MspI (NEB) for at least 8 hours at 37Â°C in a reaction volume of 50 Î¼L. The restriction enzymes were heat inactivated by incubation at 65Â°C for 20 minutes. For the ligation-mediated PCR, linkers were generated by creating a 100 pM equimolar solution of each linker oligo in 10 mM TE supplemented with NaCl for a final salt concentration of 100 mM. This solution was incubated in a boiling water bath for 7 minutes and then allowed to cool to 25Â°C to permit annealing. Linkers were recovered by ethanol precipitation and resuspended in 500 Î¼L of water. The linkers were ligated to the MseI- or MspI-digested DNA by adding 5 Î¼L of appropriate linker, 10x T4 DNA ligase buffer, water and 400 U of T4 DNA ligase (NEB) in a 50 Î¼L reaction volume. This reaction was incubated at 16Â°C for at least 8 hoursm, and the ligase was heat inactivated at 65Â°C for 10 minutes. Free linkers were removed using a YM-50 spin column (Microcon) by adding the ligation reaction and 160 Î¼L of 1/10 TE to the column and spinning at 12,000xg for 5 minutes or until the membrane is almost dry. The sample was recovered by adding 20 Î¼L of 1/10 TE to the membrane, incubating at room temperature for 5 minutes, and spinning at 1000xg for 3 minutes per manufacturerâs instructions. The PCR was performed with the FastStart High Fidelity PCR System (Roche) with the following reaction reagents: 4 Î¼L of linker-ligated DNA, 10 Î¼L of 10x FastStart PCR buffer, 10 Î¼L of 2mM dNTPs, 12 Î¼L of 10 pM linker-specific primer, 20 Î¼L of 5x GC-rich solution, 1 Î¼L of FastStart Taq Polymerase, and 43 Î¼L of water. The PCR conditions were as follows: 96Â°C for 6 minutes; 30 cycles of 96Â°C for 30 seconds, 55Â°C for 30 seconds, and 72Â°C for 30 seconds; 72Â°C for 7 minutes. Three microliters of the PCR product were run on a 1.5% agarose gel for quality control. The products shoÎ¼Ld range from 200 bp to 600 bp. The MseI and MspI PCR products were combined and concentrated in a YM-30 spin column (Microcon). The combined PCR products (~200 Î¼L) and 300 Î¼L of 1/10 TE were added to the membrane and spun at 14,000xg 40 to 60 minutes, checking every 15 minutes until the volume is approximately 25 Î¼L. The DNA was recovered per manufacturerâs instruction. The DNA was quantitated using the NanoDrop system (Thermo Scientific).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Seven and a half micrograms of DNA were fragmented using 0.016 U of DNaseI (NEB) and 10x DNaseI buffer in a 50 Î¼L reaction. The reaction was incubated at 37Â°C for 25 minutes followed by heat inactivation at 95Â°C for 15 minutes. The fragmented samples were enzymatically biotinylated using the GeneChip WT Double-Stranded DNA Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix) per manufacturerâs protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Seven and a half micrograms of biotin-labeled DNA was hybridized to the appropriate Affymetrix Human Tiling 2.0R Array for 16 hours at 45Â°C at 60 rpm in an Affymetrix hybridization oven per manufacturerâs protocol.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were scanned on an Affymetrix Scanner 3700 7G.!Sample_description = ERP3 Copy Number profile, SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix Human Tiling 2.0R Arrays were analyzed using Tiling Array Software (v 1.1.02 Affymetrix). Probe locations were mapped using the NCBI36/hg18 genome build from March 2006. Raw-intensity data were scaled to a target intensity of 100 and normalized by quantile normalization. Normalized probe intensities were analyzed by Wilcoxon rank sum one-sided test, detecting probes with intensities significantly different between the cancer and normal reference samples. The probe analysis for determining signal ratios and p-values was performed using a bandwidth of 500 bp.!Sample_data_processing = pvalue.bar and signal.bar files were generated using the Tiling Array Software (Affymetrix) as described in the data processing protocol. The pvalue.bar files contain -10log10 pvalues calculated form a Wilcoxon one-sided test. The signal.bar files contain Log2 signal intensity (test/control).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Jamie,,Guenthoer!Sample_contact_email = jguentho@fhcrc.org!Sample_contact_department = Human Biology!Sample_contact_institute = Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center!Sample_contact_address = 1100 Fairview Ave N!Sample_contact_city = Seattle!Sample_contact_state = WA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 98109!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM740nnn/GSM740018/suppl/GSM740018_ERP3_CGH.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM740nnn/GSM740018/suppl/GSM740018_ERP3_CGH.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29876!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	1.000000	1	51586	0.249786	1.180563	nan	nanCN_473964	1.000000	1	51659	-0.034152	1.180438	nan	nanCN_473965	1.000000	1	51674	-0.260073	1.180412	nan	nanCN_473981	1.000000	1	52771	-0.497700	1.178542	nan	nanCN_473982	1.000000	1	52788	-0.099473	1.178513	nan	nanCN_497981	1.000000	1	62627	-0.130927	1.162319	nan	nanCN_502615	1.000000	1	75787	-0.644988	1.142446	nan	nanCN_502613	1.000000	1	75849	-0.370868	1.142358	nan	nanCN_502614	1.000000	1	76175	-0.862572	1.141894	nan	nanCN_502616	0.000000	1	76192	-2.770382	1.141870	nan	nanCN_502843	3.000000	1	88453	0.667371	1.125497	nan	nanCN_466171	3.000000	1	218557	1.080457	3.688191	nan	nanCN_468414	3.000000	1	218926	-0.161267	3.688389	nan	nanCN_468412	3.000000	1	219009	0.467631	3.688433	nan	nanCN_468413	3.000000	1	219024	0.667487	3.688441	nan	nanCN_470565	3.000000	1	219470	0.005356	3.688680	nan	nanCN_468424	3.000000	1	225521	0.713379	3.691946	nan	nanCN_468425	3.000000	1	225579	0.642610	3.691978	nan	nanCN_460512	3.000000	1	346294	1.106692	7.258091	nan	nanCN_460513	3.000000	1	346393	0.953890	7.258090	nan	nan!sample_table_end
