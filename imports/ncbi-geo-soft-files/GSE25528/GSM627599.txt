The hybridization mixture was then introduced into the hybridization chamber of the microarray slide, which was incubated at 37Â°C for 48 h.!Sample_scan_protocol = scanned using GenePix4200A (Axon Instrument,Foster City, CA, USA) accoroding to the protocol.!Sample_data_processing = The log-transformed fluorescent ratios were calculated as the background-subtracted median intensity values. These ratios were used to perform Lowess normalization before copy number calculations. The purpose of normalization is to adjust for effects that arise from variations between the red and green dyes or the scanner setting of the two fluorescent dyes.!Sample_platform_id = GPL11237!Sample_contact_name = Jaeku,,Kang!Sample_contact_email = jaeku@konyang.ac.kr!Sample_contact_phone = 82-42-600-6415!Sample_contact_department = Department of Pharmacology!Sample_contact_institute = College of Medicine, Konyang University!Sample_contact_address = 685, Gasuwon-dong!Sample_contact_city = Seu-gu!Sample_contact_state = Daejeon!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 302-718!Sample_contact_country = South Korea!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM627nnn/GSM627599/suppl/GSM627599_normal5.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25528!Sample_data_row_count = 3730#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2-transformed fluorescent ratios;log2(cy3/cy5)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE2	0.1867562533	0.1275523244	0.0642864225	0.1716245826	-0.01280137211	-0.00627488112	0.21746112813	0.10049671214	0.15797432215	0.09837019519	0.15331491120	0.14781577121	0.27554383522	0.22295925623	0.22220665827	-0.08057769928	0.18792763830	0.06791519531	0.0278987732	0.265543902!sample_table_end
