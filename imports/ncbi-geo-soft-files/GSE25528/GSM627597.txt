The hybridization mixture was then introduced into the hybridization chamber of the microarray slide, which was incubated at 37Â°C for 48 h.!Sample_scan_protocol = scanned using GenePix4200A (Axon Instrument,Foster City, CA, USA) accoroding to the protocol.!Sample_data_processing = The log-transformed fluorescent ratios were calculated as the background-subtracted median intensity values. These ratios were used to perform Lowess normalization before copy number calculations. The purpose of normalization is to adjust for effects that arise from variations between the red and green dyes or the scanner setting of the two fluorescent dyes.!Sample_platform_id = GPL11237!Sample_contact_name = Jaeku,,Kang!Sample_contact_email = jaeku@konyang.ac.kr!Sample_contact_phone = 82-42-600-6415!Sample_contact_department = Department of Pharmacology!Sample_contact_institute = College of Medicine, Konyang University!Sample_contact_address = 685, Gasuwon-dong!Sample_contact_city = Seu-gu!Sample_contact_state = Daejeon!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 302-718!Sample_contact_country = South Korea!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM627nnn/GSM627597/suppl/GSM627597_normal3.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25528!Sample_data_row_count = 3730#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2-transformed fluorescent ratios;log2(cy3/cy5)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE2	0.0356596253	0.0809687964	0.0166775785	0.1630619796	0.08096879611	-0.10104961112	0.1993722213	0.10720169314	0.02993797615	0.23428460619	0.16052707720	0.02452589321	0.22955575822	0.19356550523	0.19139583627	-0.01374682528	0.03565962530	-0.10784463831	-0.0956320332	0.131914867!sample_table_end
