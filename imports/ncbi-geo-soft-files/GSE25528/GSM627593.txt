The hybridization mixture was then introduced into the hybridization chamber of the microarray slide, which was incubated at 37Â°C for 48 h.!Sample_scan_protocol = scanned using GenePix4200A (Axon Instrument,Foster City, CA, USA) accoroding to the protocol.!Sample_data_processing = The log-transformed fluorescent ratios were calculated as the background-subtracted median intensity values. These ratios were used to perform Lowess normalization before copy number calculations. The purpose of normalization is to adjust for effects that arise from variations between the red and green dyes or the scanner setting of the two fluorescent dyes.!Sample_platform_id = GPL11237!Sample_contact_name = Jaeku,,Kang!Sample_contact_email = jaeku@konyang.ac.kr!Sample_contact_phone = 82-42-600-6415!Sample_contact_department = Department of Pharmacology!Sample_contact_institute = College of Medicine, Konyang University!Sample_contact_address = 685, Gasuwon-dong!Sample_contact_city = Seu-gu!Sample_contact_state = Daejeon!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 302-718!Sample_contact_country = South Korea!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM627nnn/GSM627593/suppl/GSM627593_cs4.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25528!Sample_data_row_count = 3730#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2-transformed fluorescent ratios;log2(cy3/cy5)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE2	0.1696088213	0.2643874484	0.0977806285	0.473314586	0.13247253711	0.21831230212	0.20268030613	0.33043067414	0.56198559615	0.37093787619	0.12519594520	0.02847035921	0.28415116522	0.39021397923	0.33339344427	0.01463456428	0.15216626830	-0.0171739531	-0.09525001232	0.408808329!sample_table_end
