The hybridization mixture was then introduced into the hybridization chamber of the microarray slide, which was incubated at 37Â°C for 48 h.!Sample_scan_protocol = scanned using GenePix4200A (Axon Instrument,Foster City, CA, USA) accoroding to the protocol.!Sample_data_processing = The log-transformed fluorescent ratios were calculated as the background-subtracted median intensity values. These ratios were used to perform Lowess normalization before copy number calculations. The purpose of normalization is to adjust for effects that arise from variations between the red and green dyes or the scanner setting of the two fluorescent dyes.!Sample_platform_id = GPL11237!Sample_contact_name = Jaeku,,Kang!Sample_contact_email = jaeku@konyang.ac.kr!Sample_contact_phone = 82-42-600-6415!Sample_contact_department = Department of Pharmacology!Sample_contact_institute = College of Medicine, Konyang University!Sample_contact_address = 685, Gasuwon-dong!Sample_contact_city = Seu-gu!Sample_contact_state = Daejeon!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 302-718!Sample_contact_country = South Korea!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM627nnn/GSM627595/suppl/GSM627595_normal1.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25528!Sample_data_row_count = 3730#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2-transformed fluorescent ratios;log2(cy3/cy5)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE2	0.1002119033	0.1367264064	0.0855945495	0.193858526	0.08981777311	-0.03255694812	0.28980610613	0.21302549514	0.22831089815	0.12149002619	0.14643573920	0.07451787721	0.40889428422	0.23030263723	0.29896582427	-0.04008356828	0.15790657330	-0.03044430431	-0.09835126632	0.241972329!sample_table_end
