The hybridization mixture was then introduced into the hybridization chamber of the microarray slide, which was incubated at 37Â°C for 48 h.!Sample_scan_protocol = scanned using GenePix4200A (Axon Instrument,Foster City, CA, USA) accoroding to the protocol.!Sample_data_processing = The log-transformed fluorescent ratios were calculated as the background-subtracted median intensity values. These ratios were used to perform Lowess normalization before copy number calculations. The purpose of normalization is to adjust for effects that arise from variations between the red and green dyes or the scanner setting of the two fluorescent dyes.!Sample_platform_id = GPL11237!Sample_contact_name = Jaeku,,Kang!Sample_contact_email = jaeku@konyang.ac.kr!Sample_contact_phone = 82-42-600-6415!Sample_contact_department = Department of Pharmacology!Sample_contact_institute = College of Medicine, Konyang University!Sample_contact_address = 685, Gasuwon-dong!Sample_contact_city = Seu-gu!Sample_contact_state = Daejeon!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 302-718!Sample_contact_country = South Korea!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM627nnn/GSM627585/suppl/GSM627585_ca1.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25528!Sample_data_row_count = 3730#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2-transformed fluorescent ratios;log2(cy3/cy5)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE2	0.2118176933	0.052024144	0.0943301755	0.178063176	0.1175055611	0.0548991612	0.20821109413	0.05021932914	0.06659280615	0.10481688119	0.15076298620	0.07804997521	0.17898694622	0.14922579823	0.17898694627	-0.02965095328	0.14248847230	-0.00977510431	-0.05068640432	0.110058064!sample_table_end
