Samples with a genotyping call rate <95% and contrast QC<0.4 according to the Affymetrix genotyping console analysis were removed and genotypes were regenerated using the remaining samples.  PLINK was used for SNP QC to exclude those failing Hardy-Weinberg test (Pâ¤1e-06) or missingness test (P<0.1) or with a MAF <0.05.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Joshua,,Rubin!Sample_contact_department = Pediatrics!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University School of Medicine!Sample_contact_address = 660 S.
