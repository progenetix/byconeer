As suggested by the manufacturer, we analyzed the samples along with forty additional samples downloaded from the manufacturerâs website (39 HapMap and 1 non-HapMap sample) for accurate genotype calling in BRLMM algorithms. Genotype calling with BRLMM was performed on the Genotyping Console!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Olivier,,Harismendy!Sample_contact_email = oharismendy@ucsd.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Oncogenomics Laboratory!Sample_contact_department = Medicine / Moores Cancer Center!Sample_contact_institute = UC San Diego!Sample_contact_address = 3855 Health Sciences Drive #0820!Sample_contact_city = La Jolla!Sample_contact_state = California!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 92093-0820!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1359nnn/GSM1359070/suppl/GSM1359070_U87MG-SC11.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE56316!Sample_data_row_count = 262314
