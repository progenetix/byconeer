Snap-frozen tumor biopsies and matched normal tissue samples were collected with institutional review board approval.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = High molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and analyzed by Affymetrix 250K SNP array. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was digested with Nsp1, and linkers were ligated to the restriction fragments to permit PCR amplification. The PCR products were purified and fragmented by treatment with DNase I, then biotin-labeled and hybridized to microarray chips, according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized chip arrays were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G system, accroding to the manufacturer's protocol.!Sample_data_processing = The positions and intensities of the fluorescence emissions were analyzed using dChip software. Array intensity was normalized to the array with median intensity. 7 normal tissues corresponding to 7 patients were included as controls. Median  smoothing was used to infer copy number.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Jonathan,A,Fletcher!Sample_contact_email = jfletcher@partners.org!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 75 Francis Street!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1280nnn/GSM1280495/suppl/GSM1280495_GIST-62.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE53021!Sample_data_row_count = 262264
