Fifty ml of the supernatant of the cell lines SW480 or NIH3T3 were cleared of any remaining cells and cell debris by a centrifugation step at 400 x g for 20 min (Biofuge primo R, Heraeus) and passed through a 0.45mm filter (Sartorius, 16555), to remove potentially contaminating cells. The supernatants were processed as follows: 1) enzymatically digested with DNAse and/or Proteases, or 2) concentrated, first with an ultra filtration system, and then with a speed vacuum device (Vacufuge plus, Eppendorf) up to 10 ml; or 3) it was immediately used for passive transfection. The concentrated supernatant was immediately cryopreserved at -80C until circulating DNA extraction. An aliquot of each processed supernatant was seeded in a culture flask and incubated at 37C for 48 hours, to verify the absence of living cells.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Affymetrix standard protocol!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 7G Plus!Sample_description = SW480_4_(Mapping250K_Sty)!Sample_data_processing = CEL files were captured using the Affymetrix genotyping console.
