Equal amounts (200 pmol) of Cy5- and Cy3-labeled probe were combined with 100 ug Cot-1 DNA followed by an ethanol precipitation. Resuspension of the pellet was done in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.1% Tween 20, 2 x SSC, and 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5) containing 400 ug yeast tRNA to hybridize a spotting area of 24 x 60 mm.  The slide was blocked with 50 ug Cot-1 DNA and 300 ug salmon sperm DNA dissolved in 60 ul hybridization buffer. Blocking solution and probe mixture were denaturated for 10 min in a water bath at 75C. Blocking solution was then placed on the slide covered with a coverslip (24 x 60 mm) and placed in a humid chamber. Meanwhile, the probe was placed at 37C for preannealing. After 1 hr of blocking, the coverslip was removed and probe was placed on the slide. After placing a coverslip (24 x 60 mm), the slide was placed in a humid chamber saturated with 20% formamide and 2 x SSC. Hybridization was allowed to take place for two nights at 37C. Posthybridization washes were performed as described by Fiegler et al. (2003). The coverslip was removed by placing the slide in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20, followed by a 10- min wash in a fresh solution of PBS/Tween 20 at room temperature, 30 min in 50% formamide/2 x SSC at 42C, and 10 min in PBS/0.05% Tween 20 at room temperature. Slides were spin dried at 1000 rpm for 5 min. See also Vermeesch et al: Molecular Karyotyping: Array CGH Quality Criteria for Constitutional Genetic Diagnosis.

Spot intensities were corrected for local background, and only spots with signal intensities at least two fold above background signal intensities were included in the final analysis. For each clone, a ratio of Cy5 to Cy3 fluorescent intensity was calculated. Normalization of the data was achieved by dividing the fluorescent intensity ratio of each spot by the mean of the ratios of the autosomes followed by the 2D normalization. Normalized ratios of the duplicates were averaged and a log2 value was calculated. Precise localizations of clones spotted on the array were obtained from the Ensemble database (www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens). The Normalized ratio is not included  in the submitted raw data.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3888!Sample_contact_name = Rekin's,,Janky!Sample_contact_email = Nucleomics.Bioinformatics@vib.be!Sample_contact_phone = +32(0)16 37 31 26!Sample_contact_department = Nucleomics Core!Sample_contact_institute = VIB!Sample_contact_address = Herestraat 49 Box 816!Sample_contact_city = Leuven!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = B-3000!Sample_contact_country = Belgium!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE5336!Sample_data_row_count = 7487
