The hybridization mixture was dispensed to a microarray chip and assembled with an Agilent SureHyb chamber. The assembled slide chamber was placed in the rotator rack in a hybridization oven set to 65Â°C for 40 hours with suitable rotation.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned on a were scanned on an Agilent Microarray Scanner G2565C with 2-Î¼m resolution.!Sample_description = Esophageal Cancer Project!Sample_data_processing = Data were extracted from scanned images using the Feature Extraction software, version 11 (Agilent).
