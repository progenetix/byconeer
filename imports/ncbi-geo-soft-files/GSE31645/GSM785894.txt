Genomic profiles from 2.5M data were partitioned using the R implementation (DNAcopy) of Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) with an alpha value of 0.001. Change points were analyzed using the SDundo option in CBS with a standard deviation threshold of 1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13314!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE31645!Sample_data_row_count = 2443179#ID_REF = #B Allele Freq = #VALUE = Log R Ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	B Allele Freq	VALUEGA008510	1	0.2436469GA008524	0.01798209	-0.1244701GA008529	1	-0.1946278GA008532	0.00	-0.04375289GA026677	0.8583999	-3.342385GA026703	0.9938078	-0.0175238GA026708	0.5030895	-2.86367GA026710	0.618036	-4.139835GA026711	0.9834188	0.05734827GA026714	0.9955837	-0.02920107GA026716	0.00	-0.159445GA026719	0.4611612	-3.350679SNP6-116839163	0.9986546	-0.1912414SNP13-68103812	1	-0.009339933SNP10-107373842	0.9901434	0.0222193SNP4-25133756	0.9897324	0.04191294SNP22-33661407	0.0001537865	0.05371878SNP7-45640649	0.4872655	0.02858127SNP2-175106595	0.6106271	-0.01987769SNP6-37711081	0.00	-0.2687329!sample_table_end
