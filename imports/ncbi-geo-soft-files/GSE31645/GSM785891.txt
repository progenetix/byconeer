Genomic profiles from 2.5M data were partitioned using the R implementation (DNAcopy) of Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) with an alpha value of 0.001. Change points were analyzed using the SDundo option in CBS with a standard deviation threshold of 1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13314!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE31645!Sample_data_row_count = 2443179#ID_REF = #B Allele Freq = #VALUE = Log R Ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	B Allele Freq	VALUEGA008510	1	0.2505613GA008524	0.01452039	-0.5023032GA008529	1	-0.08798628GA008532	0.00	0.1763156GA026677	0.8473861	-3.350784GA026703	0.9748096	-0.05243814GA026708	0.5519387	-3.5979GA026710	0.4718686	-4.160421GA026711	1	0.1613601GA026714	0.9630542	-0.1372945GA026716	0.06588543	-0.2757008GA026719	0.8059447	-4.010221SNP6-116839163	1	0.1470403SNP13-68103812	1	-0.2477094SNP10-107373842	1	-0.383807SNP4-25133756	0.5912547	-0.1990455SNP22-33661407	0.3118561	0.11508SNP7-45640649	0.00	0.5198547SNP2-175106595	0.00	-0.1744815SNP6-37711081	0.003494411	-0.5022615!sample_table_end
