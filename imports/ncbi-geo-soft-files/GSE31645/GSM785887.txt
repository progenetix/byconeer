Genomic profiles from 2.5M data were partitioned using the R implementation (DNAcopy) of Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) with an alpha value of 0.001. Change points were analyzed using the SDundo option in CBS with a standard deviation threshold of 1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13314!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE31645!Sample_data_row_count = 2443179#ID_REF = #B Allele Freq = #VALUE = Log R Ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	B Allele Freq	VALUEGA008510	1	0.4434984GA008524	0.001556347	0.02591512GA008529	1	-0.05396526GA008532	0.005368233	0.1173042GA026677	0.7644984	-2.175584GA026703	0.9797444	-0.4206575GA026708	0.498266	-2.846211GA026710	0.4452405	-3.340204GA026711	1	0.3160678GA026714	0.9334984	-0.1738579GA026716	0.00	-0.01425758GA026719	0.5240341	-3.210389SNP6-116839163	0.9915081	-0.152689SNP13-68103812	0.9413422	0.03458641SNP10-107373842	1	0.218398SNP4-25133756	0.3965233	-0.006897747SNP22-33661407	0.004688298	0.1815249SNP7-45640649	0.00	0.5595757SNP2-175106595	1	0.03071916SNP6-37711081	0.4097054	-0.2461256!sample_table_end
