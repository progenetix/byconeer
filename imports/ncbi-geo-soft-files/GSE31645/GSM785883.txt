Genomic profiles from 2.5M data were partitioned using the R implementation (DNAcopy) of Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) with an alpha value of 0.001. Change points were analyzed using the SDundo option in CBS with a standard deviation threshold of 1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13314!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE31645!Sample_data_row_count = 2443179#ID_REF = #B Allele Freq = #VALUE = Log R Ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	B Allele Freq	VALUEGA008510	1	0.3034201GA008524	0.01782469	-0.1107807GA008529	0.9778736	0.1143795GA008532	0.006587688	0.1050856GA026677	0.9300528	-2.97793GA026703	0.9967091	0.01410614GA026708	0.645785	-2.788945GA026710	0.7964081	-4.187665GA026711	1	0.2598236GA026714	0.9838275	-0.07167158GA026716	0.02524751	-0.07179277GA026719	0.6796436	-3.804289SNP6-116839163	0.9988434	0.04427271SNP13-68103812	0.488554	0.0002997346SNP10-107373842	0.4316163	-0.04152729SNP4-25133756	0.01494031	-0.02988033SNP22-33661407	0.01957121	0.03426566SNP7-45640649	0.00	0.07923964SNP2-175106595	0.5625361	-0.06947452SNP6-37711081	0.5945668	-0.2363978!sample_table_end
