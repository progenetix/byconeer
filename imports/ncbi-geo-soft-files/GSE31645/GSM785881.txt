Genomic profiles from 2.5M data were partitioned using the R implementation (DNAcopy) of Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) with an alpha value of 0.001. Change points were analyzed using the SDundo option in CBS with a standard deviation threshold of 1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13314!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE31645!Sample_data_row_count = 2443179#ID_REF = #B Allele Freq = #VALUE = Log R Ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	B Allele Freq	VALUEGA008510	1	0.1492682GA008524	0.00	-0.1071871GA008529	1	0.04235474GA008532	0.006276367	0.02059784GA026677	0.6108409	-2.84132GA026703	0.9926949	-0.02966745GA026708	0.565762	-2.643204GA026710	0.397385	-3.381902GA026711	0.950123	0.1311326GA026714	0.9828396	-0.1507185GA026716	0.00	-0.1180906GA026719	0.506541	-3.130293SNP6-116839163	1	0.06515199SNP13-68103812	0.5437672	-0.03096521SNP10-107373842	1	0.1490872SNP4-25133756	1	-0.1527403SNP22-33661407	0.009393591	0.03963966SNP7-45640649	0.007119156	0.385305SNP2-175106595	0.6543027	-0.02320516SNP6-37711081	0.5943989	-0.3000723!sample_table_end
