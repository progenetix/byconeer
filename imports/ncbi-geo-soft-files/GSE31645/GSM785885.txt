Genomic profiles from 2.5M data were partitioned using the R implementation (DNAcopy) of Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) with an alpha value of 0.001. Change points were analyzed using the SDundo option in CBS with a standard deviation threshold of 1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13314!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE31645!Sample_data_row_count = 2443179#ID_REF = #B Allele Freq = #VALUE = Log R Ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	B Allele Freq	VALUEGA008510	1	-0.05574209GA008524	0.00	1.213921GA008529	1	0.5090062GA008532	0.00	0.04149038GA026677	0.7019206	-2.760489GA026703	1	-0.007668586GA026708	0.5540741	-3.650674GA026710	0.5181075	-3.843313GA026711	1	1.075699GA026714	1	0.2669555GA026716	0.00	0.970024GA026719	0.5923781	-3.728243SNP6-116839163	1	0.02255204SNP13-68103812	0.4774854	0.1060463SNP10-107373842	1	-0.3388994SNP4-25133756	1	-0.1447115SNP22-33661407	0.002140781	0.253576SNP7-45640649	0.003832144	0.1033001SNP2-175106595	0.5909146	-0.1336772SNP6-37711081	0.585016	-0.5118611!sample_table_end
