Genomic profiles from 2.5M data were partitioned using the R implementation (DNAcopy) of Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) with an alpha value of 0.001. Change points were analyzed using the SDundo option in CBS with a standard deviation threshold of 1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13314!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE31645!Sample_data_row_count = 2443179#ID_REF = #B Allele Freq = #VALUE = Log R Ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	B Allele Freq	VALUEGA008510	1	0.1846752GA008524	0.01319818	-0.112417GA008529	1	-0.05409444GA008532	0.004350828	0.04897454GA026677	0.7504494	-2.768303GA026703	1	0.009785571GA026708	0.695438	-2.746292GA026710	0.4105878	-2.859274GA026711	1	0.181863GA026714	1	-0.05030177GA026716	0.00	-0.1656634GA026719	0.5968528	-3.517388SNP6-116839163	0.9902011	0.04423418SNP13-68103812	1	0.03587956SNP10-107373842	0.3933023	-0.3135078SNP4-25133756	0.9926613	-0.1128831SNP22-33661407	0.5390028	-0.06971329SNP7-45640649	0.00	0.1700779SNP2-175106595	0.6309919	-0.02832016SNP6-37711081	0.005898031	-0.4054043!sample_table_end
