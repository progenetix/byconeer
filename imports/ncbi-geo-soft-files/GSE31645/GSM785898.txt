Genomic profiles from 2.5M data were partitioned using the R implementation (DNAcopy) of Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) with an alpha value of 0.001. Change points were analyzed using the SDundo option in CBS with a standard deviation threshold of 1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13314!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE31645!Sample_data_row_count = 2443179#ID_REF = #B Allele Freq = #VALUE = Log R Ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	B Allele Freq	VALUEGA008510	1	0.3441805GA008524	0.01568982	-0.21798GA008529	0.970768	-0.1792623GA008532	0.00	0.0929634GA026677	0.5606878	-2.523699GA026703	0.9670262	-0.05182814GA026708	0.5215439	-3.083944GA026710	0.4744126	-3.770356GA026711	1	0.2638924GA026714	0.8997986	-0.03508535GA026716	0.008027213	-0.1277849GA026719	0.5208365	-3.63078SNP6-116839163	1	0.105982SNP13-68103812	1	0.04800852SNP10-107373842	0.9751853	-0.001608676SNP4-25133756	0.5633487	-0.01013771SNP22-33661407	1	-0.025563SNP7-45640649	0.00	0.03475783SNP2-175106595	0.006735323	-0.144238SNP6-37711081	0.5987386	-0.2327237!sample_table_end
