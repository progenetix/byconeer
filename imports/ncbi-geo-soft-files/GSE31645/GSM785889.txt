Genomic profiles from 2.5M data were partitioned using the R implementation (DNAcopy) of Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) with an alpha value of 0.001. Change points were analyzed using the SDundo option in CBS with a standard deviation threshold of 1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13314!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE31645!Sample_data_row_count = 2443179#ID_REF = #B Allele Freq = #VALUE = Log R Ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	B Allele Freq	VALUEGA008510	1	0.3037558GA008524	0.007167732	-0.01638GA008529	1	-0.007806479GA008532	0.0008266008	0.01115353GA026677	0.9003921	-3.192825GA026703	0.9979329	-0.1825983GA026708	0.587104	-2.709378GA026710	0.324427	-3.256219GA026711	1	0.1775698GA026714	0.935825	-0.07444574GA026716	0.00	-0.07652081GA026719	0.5409423	-3.249719SNP6-116839163	1	0.01141445SNP13-68103812	0.001120105	0.08544248SNP10-107373842	1	0.001189801SNP4-25133756	0.5520968	0.04925497SNP22-33661407	1	-0.09670276SNP7-45640649	0.00	0.1453566SNP2-175106595	0.6014348	-0.1105775SNP6-37711081	1	-0.2099561!sample_table_end
