Genomic profiles from 2.5M data were partitioned using the R implementation (DNAcopy) of Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) with an alpha value of 0.001. Change points were analyzed using the SDundo option in CBS with a standard deviation threshold of 1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13314!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE31645!Sample_data_row_count = 2443179#ID_REF = #B Allele Freq = #VALUE = Log R Ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	B Allele Freq	VALUEGA008510	1	0.4581788GA008524	0.00	-0.05719541GA008529	1	0.05485087GA008532	0.00	0.1867171GA026677	0.6678889	-2.74289GA026703	0.9942987	-0.02607627GA026708	0.622633	-2.97981GA026710	0.2496368	-3.594161GA026711	1	0.4897617GA026714	0.9537882	-0.1164161GA026716	0.00	0.08405624GA026719	0.4867362	-3.511217SNP6-116839163	1	0.05206749SNP13-68103812	0.9991804	-0.1247766SNP10-107373842	0.9934073	-0.09198256SNP4-25133756	1	-0.1139559SNP22-33661407	0.5269115	-0.05216842SNP7-45640649	0.001674766	0.2643939SNP2-175106595	0.624375	-0.07538845SNP6-37711081	0.9927205	-0.3089792!sample_table_end
