Genomic profiles from 2.5M data were partitioned using the R implementation (DNAcopy) of Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) with an alpha value of 0.001. Change points were analyzed using the SDundo option in CBS with a standard deviation threshold of 1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13314!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE31645!Sample_data_row_count = 2443179#ID_REF = #B Allele Freq = #VALUE = Log R Ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	B Allele Freq	VALUEGA008510	1	0.315704GA008524	0.01084236	-0.08539598GA008529	0.9613503	0.1172755GA008532	0.00	-0.1015025GA026677	0.6839522	-2.674221GA026703	0.979189	-0.08259486GA026708	0.6325533	-2.690386GA026710	0.5113544	-3.945009GA026711	0.9885119	0.1685118GA026714	0.9971992	0.003404161GA026716	0.00	0.03834216GA026719	0.3849776	-3.382932SNP6-116839163	0.9891366	0.04616031SNP13-68103812	0.3736681	-0.2589492SNP10-107373842	1	-0.4514883SNP4-25133756	0.5670879	0.07027607SNP22-33661407	0.001851246	-0.01465913SNP7-45640649	0.00	0.00353524SNP2-175106595	0.5433147	-0.06115581SNP6-37711081	0.5705361	-0.2734273!sample_table_end
