Genomic profiles from 2.5M data were partitioned using the R implementation (DNAcopy) of Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) with an alpha value of 0.001. Change points were analyzed using the SDundo option in CBS with a standard deviation threshold of 1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13314!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE31645!Sample_data_row_count = 2443179#ID_REF = #B Allele Freq = #VALUE = Log R Ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	B Allele Freq	VALUEGA008510	1	0.09317365GA008524	0.00	-0.4393581GA008529	0.9890682	0.001789573GA008532	0.00	0.4455044GA026677	0.6876042	-2.663337GA026703	1	0.05170963GA026708	0.5852003	-3.10563GA026710	0.4827943	-3.580113GA026711	1	0.1533332GA026714	0.9506334	-0.06354636GA026716	0.02109845	-0.1835738GA026719	0.6275067	-3.636738SNP6-116839163	1	1.805806E-05SNP13-68103812	1	-0.01027428SNP10-107373842	0.9872435	-0.139769SNP4-25133756	1	-0.1144602SNP22-33661407	0.003340135	0.08802053SNP7-45640649	0.00	-0.153563SNP2-175106595	0.003379481	-0.2062337SNP6-37711081	0.418838	-0.3716101!sample_table_end
