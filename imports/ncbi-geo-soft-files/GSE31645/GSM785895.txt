Genomic profiles from 2.5M data were partitioned using the R implementation (DNAcopy) of Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) with an alpha value of 0.001. Change points were analyzed using the SDundo option in CBS with a standard deviation threshold of 1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13314!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE31645!Sample_data_row_count = 2443179#ID_REF = #B Allele Freq = #VALUE = Log R Ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	B Allele Freq	VALUEGA008510	1	0.3130046GA008524	0.00	-0.01609414GA008529	1	-0.120172GA008532	0.00	-0.0115105GA026677	0.8354135	-2.835002GA026703	1	-0.03112618GA026708	0.6737487	-3.043381GA026710	0.7160861	-3.94546GA026711	1	0.19756GA026714	1	-0.1100084GA026716	0.00	-0.2267222GA026719	0.5720993	-4.099287SNP6-116839163	1	-0.1181118SNP13-68103812	0.9972371	0.08344151SNP10-107373842	1	-0.0533373SNP4-25133756	1	-0.01570785SNP22-33661407	0.4621562	0.01197161SNP7-45640649	0.00	0.1055401SNP2-175106595	1	-0.1531958SNP6-37711081	0.546946	-0.1512646!sample_table_end
