Genomic profiles from 2.5M data were partitioned using the R implementation (DNAcopy) of Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) with an alpha value of 0.001. Change points were analyzed using the SDundo option in CBS with a standard deviation threshold of 1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13314!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE31645!Sample_data_row_count = 2443179#ID_REF = #B Allele Freq = #VALUE = Log R Ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	B Allele Freq	VALUEGA008510	1	0.3787157GA008524	0.00	-0.01150149GA008529	1	0.1270387GA008532	0.00	0.1725371GA026677	0.5364497	-3.068772GA026703	1	-0.08535903GA026708	0.5640483	-3.014121GA026710	0.4253423	-3.472113GA026711	0.985279	0.08735617GA026714	1	-0.3304462GA026716	0.00	0.05923519GA026719	0.4216366	-3.35963SNP6-116839163	0.5501397	0.01600078SNP13-68103812	0.4908231	-0.06499119SNP10-107373842	0.9908614	-0.08188879SNP4-25133756	0.00	0.1195941SNP22-33661407	0.01203518	0.2022347SNP7-45640649	0.00	-0.3353818SNP2-175106595	0.003186476	-0.1728579SNP6-37711081	0.5763705	-0.3555057!sample_table_end
