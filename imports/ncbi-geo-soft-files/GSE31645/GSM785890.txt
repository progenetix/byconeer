Genomic profiles from 2.5M data were partitioned using the R implementation (DNAcopy) of Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) with an alpha value of 0.001. Change points were analyzed using the SDundo option in CBS with a standard deviation threshold of 1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13314!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE31645!Sample_data_row_count = 2443179#ID_REF = #B Allele Freq = #VALUE = Log R Ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	B Allele Freq	VALUEGA008510	1	0.5679703GA008524	0.03283735	-0.1970206GA008529	1	-0.283529GA008532	0.00	0.2020573GA026677	0.5753211	-2.845858GA026703	1	0.1558267GA026708	0.5602043	-2.702555GA026710	0.504131	-3.520464GA026711	0.9253286	-0.2212033GA026714	1	-0.5377743GA026716	0.00	-0.1288111GA026719	0.5103375	-2.403924SNP6-116839163	0.9976835	-0.3186575SNP13-68103812	0.9822419	-0.1761799SNP10-107373842	0.9337984	-0.5745354SNP4-25133756	0.6118103	0.0002141025SNP22-33661407	1	-0.06953488SNP7-45640649	0.01945709	-0.3177789SNP2-175106595	0.002021949	-0.3921973SNP6-37711081	0.5937636	-0.1064739!sample_table_end
