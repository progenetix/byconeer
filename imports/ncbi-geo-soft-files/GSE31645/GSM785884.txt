Genomic profiles from 2.5M data were partitioned using the R implementation (DNAcopy) of Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) with an alpha value of 0.001. Change points were analyzed using the SDundo option in CBS with a standard deviation threshold of 1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13314!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE31645!Sample_data_row_count = 2443179#ID_REF = #B Allele Freq = #VALUE = Log R Ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	B Allele Freq	VALUEGA008510	1	0.2667618GA008524	0.005388286	-0.05163865GA008529	1	0.04971347GA008532	0.006853641	0.2819488GA026677	0.8234081	-2.491974GA026703	0.976765	0.05259807GA026708	0.5476271	-2.495526GA026710	0.7001169	-3.81876GA026711	1	-0.02854924GA026714	0.9508754	-0.1377523GA026716	0.06647756	-0.1405342GA026719	0.5075407	-2.947005SNP6-116839163	1	0.02551641SNP13-68103812	1	-0.03919033SNP10-107373842	1	-0.1140918SNP4-25133756	0.9887291	-0.1136689SNP22-33661407	0.01618786	-0.03621604SNP7-45640649	0.0265646	0.06123472SNP2-175106595	0.002509138	-0.02843426SNP6-37711081	0.6025225	-0.2262696!sample_table_end
