Genomic profiles from 2.5M data were partitioned using the R implementation (DNAcopy) of Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) with an alpha value of 0.001. Change points were analyzed using the SDundo option in CBS with a standard deviation threshold of 1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13314!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE31645!Sample_data_row_count = 2443179#ID_REF = #B Allele Freq = #VALUE = Log R Ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	B Allele Freq	VALUEGA008510	1	0.3607596GA008524	0.009817507	-0.2871011GA008529	1	-0.06741028GA008532	0.00	0.2670918GA026677	0.7381473	-2.699491GA026703	0.9997638	-0.1090047GA026708	0.3279575	-3.27811GA026710	0.6803575	-3.52691GA026711	1	0.01402115GA026714	1	-0.1020592GA026716	0.00	-0.3331153GA026719	0.3973073	-3.525383SNP6-116839163	1	-0.1497804SNP13-68103812	0.4917849	0.157961SNP10-107373842	1	-0.004842205SNP4-25133756	0.5063348	-0.1192334SNP22-33661407	0.001003685	0.08140558SNP7-45640649	0.00	0.1553413SNP2-175106595	0.00	-0.3818667SNP6-37711081	0.5742176	-0.4373684!sample_table_end
