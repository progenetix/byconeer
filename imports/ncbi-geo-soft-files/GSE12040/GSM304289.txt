Segraves Reviewed: R. Davis!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 1.0 Materials!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 1. Approximately 0.5 to1 liter each of Human QNS (Quantity Not Sufficient) male and female blood.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 2. 50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes with screw on or snap caps.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 3. Access to a BSL-2 level area with appropriate safeguards and hood.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 4. Serological pipets in 5mL, 25mL, and 50mL sizes and an automated pipet controller.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 5. Centrifuge set for 50mL tubes.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 6. Erythrocyte Lysis buffer; 9 volumes of 0.155 M NH4Cl (MW 53.49 X 0.155 = 8.291 grams into 1 Liter) and 1 volume of 0.17 M Tris, set to a pH of 7.65. This solution should be measured precisely.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 7. Wash Buffer; 10 mM NaCl (5 mL of 1.0M NaCl into 495 mL dH2O) and 10 mM EDTA (10 mL of 0.5M EDTA into 490 mL dH2O).!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 8. Nuclei Lysis Buffer; 400 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.2.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 9. Protease K 500 ug!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 10. 20% SDS solution.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 11. Saturated NaCl solution at approximately 6 M.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 12. Ice cold 100% EtOH!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 13. Ice cold 70% EtOH.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 14. 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 15. Fluorometer and cuvettes!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 2.0 Procedure for Isolation of DNA from Human Blood!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 1. If desired, combine partial bags of male blood into one bag. If reference DNA from a single donor is desired keep individual bags separate. Repeat with female blood and place back into refrigerator. The following steps should be performed on only male blood until complete, then with female blood to prevent inadvertent cross-contamination.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 2. Place approximately 50 mL aliquots of the male blood into clean 50 mL tubes.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 3. Centrifuge the blood at 4,000 rpm at 4Â°C for 10 minutes.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 4. The blood will separate into serum and solids. Aspirate off and discard the top layer of serum.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 5. Using a 10 mL serological pipet, remove the top 1/4-inch of red blood cells from the remaining dark brown blood and place this into new 50 mL centrifuge tubes. This layer is called the buffy coat and this is where most white blood cells will be found. Discard the remaining red blood cells. Combine the buffy coats from 2-3 tubes to a volume of approximately 10 mL.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 6. Combine the approximately 10 mL of red and white blood cell mix with 3-5 volumes (fill the 50 mL tube to the top with Lysis Buffer) of Erythrocyte Lysis Buffer preheated to 37 Â°C. This should lyse the red blood cells and hopefully not the white blood cells. Incubate for 5 minutes at 37Â°C.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 7. Centrifuge the lysate for 10 minutes at 4,000 rpm at 4Â°C.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 8. Remove all but 4-5 mL of the supernatant above the loose dark brown pellet that contains the white blood cells.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 9. Add 25 mL of the wash solution (NaCl and EDTA) and resuspend the pellet by vigorously shaking with the lid on tight. Centrifuge again at 4,000 rpm and 4Â°C for 10 minutes. Aspirate off all but 4-5 mL of wash solution above the pellet.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 10. Repeat step 9. Repeat the wash step until the pellet has turned white.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 11. Resuspend the pellet in 10 mL of Nuclei Lysis Buffer. Be sure the pellet is broken up so that the SDS and Protease K can get to the cells.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 12. Add 330 Ã¬L of 20% SDS solution and 500 Ã¬g of Protease K (resuspended at 20 ug/uL for a total of 25 uL) and vortex to mix well. The combination of nuclei lysis buffer and SDS and Protease K should lyse the outer cell membrane and the internal nuclear membrane and free the white blood cell DNA to solution.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 13. Incubate at 37Â°C overnight or until the solution is clear.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 14. Add 3.3 mL of supersaturated NaCl (6 M) to the clear solution. Vortex for 15 seconds. This âsalting outâ step precipitates proteins and leaves DNA in solution.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 15. Centrifuge at 4,000 rpm at 4Â°C for 10 minutes. Transfer supernatant to a new 50 mL tube. The supernatant may look like an opaque, viscous blob (like snot) with a yellowish tinge at the bottom. It can be hard to work with.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 16. Add 25 mL x 100% EtOH to the tube and invert the tube several times to mix well. The DNA should readily precipitate out from solution and float to the surface, if it hasnât already done so.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 17. Spool the floating DNA blob into a new 1.5 mL Centrifuge tube. Fill the tube with 70% EtOH and vortex for 1 minute.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 18. Let stand for 15 minutes. Pour out EtOH and wipe excess EtOH out of the tube with a rolled chem-wipe.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 19. Air dry the DNA for 10 - 20 minutes to insure all excess EtOH has evaporated.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 20. Resuspend the pellet in dH2O. (see note 1.)!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 21. Using a 1000 Ã¬L pipet followed by a 200 Ã¬L pipet, pipet the liquid up and down to shear the DNA and to make the solutions less viscous.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 22. Using a Fluorometer, determine DNA concentration. Aliquot DNA into new 1.5 mL tubes and dilute to a concentration of 600 ng/ Ã¬L (0.6 Ã¬g/ Ã¬L). Label and store aliquots at -20Â°C.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 3.0 Notes!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 1. Tris/EDTA is sometimes used to resuspend the DNA. It may take an hour or two to fully resuspend the DNA.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 4.0 Acknowledgements!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 1.

After post-hybridization washes, the arrays were mounted in a solution containing 90% glycerol, 10% PBS and 1 uM DAPI and sealed with a cover slip.!Sample_scan_protocol = A custom built CCD camera system was used to acquire 16 bit 1024x1024 pixel DAPI, Cy3 and Cy5 images (Pinkel et al., 1998). Image analysis was carried out using UCSF SPOT software (Jain et al., 2002).!Sample_description = no additional information!Sample_data_processing = The log2ratio of the total integrated Cy3 and Cy5 intensities for each spot after background subtraction was calculated, normalized to the median log2ratio of all the clones on the array and the average of the triplicates calculated using a second custom program, SPROC. Automatic data filtering to reject data points based on low DAPI intensity, low correlation between Cy3 and Cy5 within each segmented spot and low reference/DAPI signal intensity was also carried out using SPROC. Data files were subsequently manually edited by rejecting clones for which only one spot of the triplicate survived after SPROC analysis and for which the standard deviation of the log2ratio of the triplicate was >0.2. For each tumor, the data are plotted as the mean log2ratio of the triplicate spots for each clone normalized to the genome median log2ratio. The clones are ordered by position in the genome (UCSC draft genome sequence, August 2001 freeze) beginning at 1p and ending with Xq.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4896!Sample_contact_name = Marlies,,Nowee!Sample_contact_email = me.nowee@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31-20-4448271!Sample_contact_fax = +31-20-4448285!Sample_contact_department = Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology!Sample_contact_institute = VU University Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = Van der Boechorststraat 7!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_state = Noord-Holland!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081BT!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM304nnn/GSM304289/suppl/GSM304289.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12040!Sample_data_row_count = 2464#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 ratio (Cy3/Cy5)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEHumArray2H11_N30	HumArray2H11_C9	0.189774HumArray2H10_N30	0.336769HumArray2H10_B18	HumArray2H10_Q30	0.306119HumArray2H10_T30	0.088101HumArray2H10_B19	0.306783HumArray2H10_W30	0.221929HumArray2H9_C14	0.300682HumArray2H9_F14	0.09328HumArray2H9_I14	0.086965HumArray2H9_A23	0.123217HumArray2H9_L14	0.084208HumArray2H9_O14	0.175126HumArray2H11_L8	0.287396HumArray2H9_B4	0.240719HumArray2H10_E19	0.313994HumArray2H9_U14	0.087421HumArray2H9_R14	0.234443HumArray2H9_C17	0.264778!sample_table_end
