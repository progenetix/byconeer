A panel of chips (n = 12)  assayed with germline DNA served as a reference in order to calculate a test/reference ratio.  The ratios were then subject global normalization that assumed that the median copy number is  diploid (2n; log2 Ratio = 0).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Joel,,Greshock!Sample_contact_department = Translational Medicine, Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = GlaxoSmithKline!Sample_contact_address = 2301 Renaissance Blvd.!Sample_contact_city = King of Prussia!Sample_contact_state = PA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 19406!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM188nnn/GSM188226/suppl/GSM188226.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE7822!Sample_data_row_count = 260353#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2(estimated test/reference intensity ratio)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1794317	-0.205SNP_A-1786243	-0.729SNP_A-1967971	0.154SNP_A-1791488	-0.537SNP_A-1798049	0.049SNP_A-2138981	1.363SNP_A-2308310	0.332SNP_A-1976263	-0.247SNP_A-1784239	0.199SNP_A-1898104	-0.114SNP_A-4212440	-0.374SNP_A-2094651	-0.460SNP_A-2107677	0.482SNP_A-2071979	-0.038SNP_A-2029699	0.188SNP_A-2260858	-0.153SNP_A-4203142	-0.355SNP_A-2154361	0.136SNP_A-2118532	0.094SNP_A-1980258	-0.027!sample_table_end
