A panel of chips (n = 12)  assayed with germline DNA served as a reference in order to calculate a test/reference ratio.  The ratios were then subject global normalization that assumed that the median copy number is  diploid (2n; log2 Ratio = 0).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Joel,,Greshock!Sample_contact_department = Translational Medicine, Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = GlaxoSmithKline!Sample_contact_address = 2301 Renaissance Blvd.!Sample_contact_city = King of Prussia!Sample_contact_state = PA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 19406!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM188nnn/GSM188260/suppl/GSM188260.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE7822!Sample_data_row_count = 236472#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2(estimated test/reference intensity ratio)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-4274945	0.348SNP_A-1938722	-0.556SNP_A-1966191	0.265SNP_A-4268311	0.168SNP_A-2137254	-0.188SNP_A-2150238	-0.414SNP_A-4304307	0.158SNP_A-4254979	-0.557SNP_A-2077195	0.190SNP_A-2056347	-0.272SNP_A-2130509	-0.432SNP_A-1958474	0.114SNP_A-4258844	-0.351SNP_A-2157404	-1.110SNP_A-1900834	-0.360SNP_A-4279216	-0.358SNP_A-2085027	-0.347SNP_A-4264876	-0.218SNP_A-2066902	0.587SNP_A-2264780	-0.062!sample_table_end
