A panel of chips (n = 12)  assayed with germline DNA served as a reference in order to calculate a test/reference ratio.  The ratios were then subject global normalization that assumed that the median copy number is  diploid (2n; log2 Ratio = 0).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Joel,,Greshock!Sample_contact_department = Translational Medicine, Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = GlaxoSmithKline!Sample_contact_address = 2301 Renaissance Blvd.!Sample_contact_city = King of Prussia!Sample_contact_state = PA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 19406!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM188nnn/GSM188204/suppl/GSM188204.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE7822!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2(estimated test/reference intensity ratio)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-4274945	-0.230SNP_A-1938722	0.140SNP_A-4268311	-0.670SNP_A-1966191	-0.650SNP_A-4304307	-0.510SNP_A-2150238	0.320SNP_A-2137254	-1.520SNP_A-4254979	0.030SNP_A-2077195	-0.110SNP_A-2056347	0.370SNP_A-2130509	-0.090SNP_A-1958474	-0.930SNP_A-4258844	0.250SNP_A-2157404	-0.320SNP_A-1900834	0.040SNP_A-4279216	-0.270SNP_A-2085027	0.500SNP_A-4264876	0.140SNP_A-2066902	-0.140SNP_A-2264780	-0.780!sample_table_end
