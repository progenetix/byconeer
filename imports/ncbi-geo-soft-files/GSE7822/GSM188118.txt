A panel of chips (n = 12)  assayed with germline DNA served as a reference in order to calculate a test/reference ratio.  The ratios were then subject global normalization that assumed that the median copy number is  diploid (2n; log2 Ratio = 0).!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Joel,,Greshock!Sample_contact_department = Translational Medicine, Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = GlaxoSmithKline!Sample_contact_address = 2301 Renaissance Blvd.!Sample_contact_city = King of Prussia!Sample_contact_state = PA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 19406!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM188nnn/GSM188118/suppl/GSM188118.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE7822!Sample_data_row_count = 56960#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2(estimated test/reference intensity ratio)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1695026	0.400761SNP_A-1708397	-0.076529SNP_A-1756117	0.375964SNP_A-1681251	-0.479782SNP_A-1703730	0.207135SNP_A-1642014	-0.138495SNP_A-1716438	-0.568984SNP_A-1676647	-0.0937203SNP_A-1662583	-0.00272455SNP_A-1744538	0.113521SNP_A-1720808	-0.277993SNP_A-1666451	-0.661458SNP_A-1732220	0.0254874SNP_A-1735740	0.260209SNP_A-1750740	0.362426SNP_A-1670188	0.212473SNP_A-1654868	-0.474177SNP_A-1725145	0.0480467SNP_A-1679467	0.0605663SNP_A-1720998	-0.113571!sample_table_end
