A panel of chips (n = 12)  assayed with germline DNA served as a reference in order to calculate a test/reference ratio.  The ratios were then subject global normalization that assumed that the median copy number is  diploid (2n; log2 Ratio = 0).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Joel,,Greshock!Sample_contact_department = Translational Medicine, Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = GlaxoSmithKline!Sample_contact_address = 2301 Renaissance Blvd.!Sample_contact_city = King of Prussia!Sample_contact_state = PA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 19406!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM188nnn/GSM188224/suppl/GSM188224.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE7822!Sample_data_row_count = 260353#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2(estimated test/reference intensity ratio)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1794317	0.159SNP_A-1786243	0.031SNP_A-1967971	-0.048SNP_A-1791488	-0.243SNP_A-1798049	-0.419SNP_A-2138981	0.259SNP_A-2308310	-0.299SNP_A-1976263	-0.111SNP_A-1784239	0.245SNP_A-1898104	0.138SNP_A-4212440	-0.106SNP_A-2094651	-0.342SNP_A-2107677	0.123SNP_A-2071979	0.098SNP_A-2029699	0.673SNP_A-2260858	-0.186SNP_A-4203142	-0.159SNP_A-2154361	0.037SNP_A-2118532	-0.279SNP_A-1980258	-0.434!sample_table_end
