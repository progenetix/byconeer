A panel of chips (n = 12)  assayed with germline DNA served as a reference in order to calculate a test/reference ratio.  The ratios were then subject global normalization that assumed that the median copy number is  diploid (2n; log2 Ratio = 0).!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Joel,,Greshock!Sample_contact_department = Translational Medicine, Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = GlaxoSmithKline!Sample_contact_address = 2301 Renaissance Blvd.!Sample_contact_city = King of Prussia!Sample_contact_state = PA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 19406!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM188nnn/GSM188068/suppl/GSM188068.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE7822!Sample_data_row_count = 58633#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2(estimated test/reference intensity ratio)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1645328	-0.306979SNP_A-1717301	-1.28337SNP_A-1657566	0.705975SNP_A-1656831	0.419503SNP_A-1705671	0.447799SNP_A-1688718	-0.532691SNP_A-1668616	0.454003SNP_A-1672422	-1.59586SNP_A-1678174	0.336799SNP_A-1666818	-0.743695SNP_A-1671524	-0.451949SNP_A-1753273	0.503315SNP_A-1648084	0.373175SNP_A-1722946	0.467762SNP_A-1702283	-1.0466SNP_A-1669377	0.907001SNP_A-1706961	-0.22498SNP_A-1716335	-1.12375SNP_A-1693635	0.878177SNP_A-1645810	0.827756!sample_table_end
