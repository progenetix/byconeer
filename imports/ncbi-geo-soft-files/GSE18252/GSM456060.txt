The dChip-normalized signal intensities were converted to log2 ratios. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and segmented using the GLAD package for the R statistical environment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Zhengyan,,Kan!Sample_contact_department = Computational Biology, Oncology Research & Development!Sample_contact_institute = Pfizer!Sample_contact_address = 10770 Science Center Drive!Sample_contact_city = San Diego!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 92121!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM456nnn/GSM456060/suppl/GSM456060.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM456nnn/GSM456060/suppl/GSM456060.CHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18252!Sample_data_row_count = 57243#ID_REF = #VALUE = dChip normalized signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1691633	2.10148954391479SNP_A-1669946	2.10148954391479SNP_A-1691463	2.10148954391479SNP_A-1647681	2.10148954391479SNP_A-1691255	2.10148954391479SNP_A-1656886	2.10148954391479SNP_A-1673751	2.10148954391479SNP_A-1641890	2.10148954391479SNP_A-1656716	2.10148954391479SNP_A-1664559	2.10148954391479SNP_A-1747116	2.10148954391479SNP_A-1657969	2.10148954391479SNP_A-1716436	2.10148954391479SNP_A-1664341	2.10148954391479SNP_A-1715866	2.10148954391479SNP_A-1750090	2.10148954391479SNP_A-1655302	2.10148954391479SNP_A-1655176	2.10148954391479SNP_A-1647119	2.10148954391479SNP_A-1749896	2.10148954391479!sample_table_end
