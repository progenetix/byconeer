The dChip-normalized signal intensities were converted to log2 ratios. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and segmented using the GLAD package for the R statistical environment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Zhengyan,,Kan!Sample_contact_department = Computational Biology, Oncology Research & Development!Sample_contact_institute = Pfizer!Sample_contact_address = 10770 Science Center Drive!Sample_contact_city = San Diego!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 92121!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM455nnn/GSM455983/suppl/GSM455983.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM455nnn/GSM455983/suppl/GSM455983.CHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18252!Sample_data_row_count = 58960#ID_REF = #VALUE = dChip normalized signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1643131	1.83148121833801SNP_A-1708186	1.83148121833801SNP_A-1679806	1.83148121833801SNP_A-1687400	1.83148121833801SNP_A-1701699	1.83148121833801SNP_A-1693280	1.83148121833801SNP_A-1734642	1.83148121833801SNP_A-1705081	1.83148121833801SNP_A-1748913	1.83148121833801SNP_A-1659730	1.83148121833801SNP_A-1755914	1.83148121833801SNP_A-1681384	1.84268879890442SNP_A-1728267	1.83148121833801SNP_A-1708763	1.83148121833801SNP_A-1719311	1.83148121833801SNP_A-1741675	1.83148121833801SNP_A-1686722	1.83148121833801SNP_A-1717655	1.83148121833801SNP_A-1704403	1.83148121833801SNP_A-1672258	!sample_table_end
