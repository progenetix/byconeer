Array experiments were performed according to manufacturers instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = arrays were washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to 250K_Sty!Sample_data_processing = SNPs were genotyped by the Affymetrix Genotyping Tools Version 2.0 software.!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix CEL-files where preprocessed by the following procedure: Raw intensities were read out and preprocessed with GenePattern (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/; snpFileCreator); here, default configuration was used. As next step, intensities of each sample is divided by the mean of the normals and multiplied by 2 to take into account that normals are assumed to be diploid on average.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = martin,,sos!Sample_contact_email = martin.sos@nf.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 0049-221-4721287!Sample_contact_fax = 0049-221-4726298!Sample_contact_institute = Max-Planck Institute for neurological research!Sample_contact_address = Gleuelerstr. 50!Sample_contact_city = Cologne!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 50931!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM434nnn/GSM434325/suppl/GSM434325.cel.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE17247!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #SIGNAL = Summarized signal#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall!sample_table_beginID_REF	SIGNAL	VALUESNP_A-1909444	1.503	BBSNP_A-2237149	1.727	BBSNP_A-4303947	1.733	AASNP_A-2236359	1.706	BBSNP_A-2205441	1.578	AASNP_A-2116190	1.114	AASNP_A-4291020	1.753	AASNP_A-2109914	1.519	AASNP_A-2291997	2.004	NoCallSNP_A-4277872	1.579	AASNP_A-2118217	1.736	ABSNP_A-1866065	1.156	AASNP_A-2288244	1.576	AASNP_A-1783407	1.199	BBSNP_A-2169457	2.199	AASNP_A-4271011	1.894	BBSNP_A-2082515	1.937	BBSNP_A-1910751	2.43	ABSNP_A-2081399	1.539	BBSNP_A-2223642	1.993	BB!sample_table_end
