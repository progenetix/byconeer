Cell suspensions were run through Miltenyi MACS LS separation columns (#130-042-401) in order to negatively enrich for AML blasts.  All blast preps were analyzed by cytospins for purity. This schema always resulted in greater than 90% blast purity.  AML blast DNA used for SNP 6.0 profiling and RNA used for expression analysis (Q-PCR) was extracted from samples that were further purified as follows:  post-Miltenyi column samples were washed and stained with FITC-conjugated anti-CD33, PE-conjugated anti-CD13, and APC-conjugated anti-CD45 (all antibodies: eBioscience, San Diego, CA).  After final washing, propidium iodide (PI) was added to a concentration of 1 Î¼g/ml to discriminate dead cells.  Sorting of cells was done on a FACS-ARIA high-speed flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA).  Live cells (PI-negative) were gated for blasts by identifying those cells with intermediate-intensity staining for CD45 and low- to moderate-intensity side scatter(20).  CD33 and CD13 were then used in order to further discriminate blasts versus erythroid lineage and mature myeloid lineage cells.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Highly pure blast cells or buccal swabs were digested overnight in 100 mM Tris pH 8.0, 50 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5% SDS and 100 Î¼g/ml of Proteinase K (Invitrogen) at 560C. DNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform and precipitated using ammonium acetate, ethanol and glycogen.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = According to Affymetrix protocol!Sample_hyb_protocol = The DNA was prepared for hybridization to SNP 6.0 arrays according to the manufacturersâ recommendations.!Sample_scan_protocol = According to Affymetrix protocol!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix CEL files for each blast and buccal sample were analyzed using Genotyping Console software for initial quality control, followed by use of the Affymetrix âBirdseedâ algorithm to generate tab-delimited SNP call files in text format. Call rates for the entire group of samples included in this report were between 93.57% and 99.45% with mean and median call rates of 98.35% and 98.58%, respectively; none of the DNA samples gave out-of-bounds results. Sample copy number heatmap displays were obtained from CEL files through use of the freely available software dChip adapted to operate in a 64-bit environment.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description: dChip SNP software (www.dchip.org), build date Feb 25, 2009, compatible with 64-bit OS, analyzed the CEL files.  CEL files were normalized using the invariant set method, followed by model-based expression index calculations, and finally inferred copy number data were generated using a median-smoothing algorithm.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sami,N,Malek!Sample_contact_email = smalek@med.umich.edu, pouillet@med.umich.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 734-763-1222!Sample_contact_department = Internal Medicine, Hematology-Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Michigan!Sample_contact_address = 4410 Cancer Center; 1500 E Medical Center Dr!Sample_contact_city = Ann Arbor!Sample_contact_state = MI!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 48109!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM527nnn/GSM527819/suppl/GSM527819.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM527nnn/GSM527819/suppl/GSM527819_SNP_CALLS.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21107!Sample_data_row_count = 909508#ID_REF = #VALUE = Inferred Copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-8575125	1.680SNP_A-8575115	1.620SNP_A-8575371	1.620SNP_A-8709646	1.510SNP_A-8497791	1.620SNP_A-1909444	1.620SNP_A-8358063	1.700SNP_A-8329892	1.880SNP_A-8408912	1.880SNP_A-1886933	1.880SNP_A-2236359	1.880SNP_A-8515688	1.880SNP_A-2205441	1.520SNP_A-8524447	1.520SNP_A-8573955	1.520SNP_A-8530278	1.530SNP_A-8573668	1.320SNP_A-8573414	1.530SNP_A-8531044	1.870SNP_A-8530320	1.870!sample_table_end
