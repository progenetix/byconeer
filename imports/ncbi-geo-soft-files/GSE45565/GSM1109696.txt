DNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform and precipitated using ammonium acetate, ethanol and glycogen.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = The DNA was prepared for hybridization to Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays according to the manufacturer's recommendations.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Affymetrix Hybridization Oven 640 for 16 hrs at 50 deg C with rotation at 60 rpm. Washing and staining was done on an Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanning was done using an Affymetrix Scanner 3000 7G with autoloader.!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix CEL files for each DNA sample were analyzed using Affymetrix's Genotyping Console software for initial quality control, followed by use of the Affymetrix âBirdseedâ algorithm to determine final call rates and quality. Call rates for the longitudinal group of samples included in this report were between 95.33% and 99.68%, with a mean and median call rate of 98.67% and 98.92%, respectively.  For normal and enrollment sample call rate information, please refer to GEO accession number GSE30777.  Sample copy number heatmap displays were obtained from CEL files through use of the freely available software dChip adapted to operate in a 64-bit environment.!Sample_data_processing = dChip SNP software (www.dchip.org), build date Feb 25, 2009, compatible with 64-bit OS, analyzed the CEL files.  CEL files were normalized using the invariant set method, followed by model-based expression index calculations, and finally inferred copy number data were generated using the software's median-smoothing algorithm.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sami,N,Malek!Sample_contact_email = smalek@med.umich.edu, pouillet@med.umich.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 734-763-1222!Sample_contact_department = Internal Medicine, Hematology-Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Michigan!Sample_contact_address = 4410 Cancer Center; 1500 E Medical Center Dr!Sample_contact_city = Ann Arbor!Sample_contact_state = MI!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 48109!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1109nnn/GSM1109696/suppl/GSM1109696_Malek-041-CLL-209-long-T_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE45565!Sample_data_row_count = 909508
