A unenriched total input sample that was otherwise treated the same, was used as a reference for each sample and was used to derive copy number estimates.!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = DNA was obtained from metastatic prostate cancer tissues from the PELICAN rapid autopsy program at Johns Hopkins University, and from normal prostate tissues from organ donors.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = DNA was extracted using the manufacturer's recommended protocol!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = In the MBD-SNP assay described here, we use the MBD2-MBD polypeptide to isolate methylated DNA fragments from genomic DNA samples followed by analysis with Affymetrix SNP 6.0 high density oligonucleotide microarrays. Comparison with an unenriched total input fraction then allows genome-scale determination of total and allele-specific methylation and copy number in an integrated fashion for each specimen. Briefly, each genomic DNA specimen was divided into two fractions: i) an enriched methylated fraction (EM) and, ii) a total input fraction (TI). Each of these fractions was digested with the NspI and StyI restriction enzymes in separate reactions. The resulting genomic DNA fragments were then ligated with Affymetrix SNP 6.0 assay adaptors. These restriction digest and adaptor ligation steps were carried out following the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 assay protocols. After adaptor ligation, the EM fraction was subject to enrichment for methylated DNA fragments using MBD2-MBD polypeptides immobilized on magnetic beads as previously described (Yegnasubramanian et al., Nucl Acids Res, 2006; Yegnasubramanian et al., BMC Genomics, 2011) except that the final DNA was eluted in 30 uL of EB1 buffer (0.2X NEBuffer 1 (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), 0.2X BSA (NEB), 0.25X T4 DNA ligase Buffer (NEB)) for the NspI reaction and EB2 buffer (0.2X NEBuffer3, 0.2X BSA (NEB), 0.25X T4 DNA ligase buffer (NEB)) for the StyI reaction. The resulting EM and TI fractions were then subjected to one primer amplification, fragmentation, and labeling according to the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 manufacturerâs protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Samples were hybridized to the Affy6 chip for 18 hrs. We washed and stained the arrays using an Affymetrix fluidics Station 450 and scanned the arrays using a GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA).!Sample_scan_protocol = The Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Operating Software (GCOS) was used to collect and extract feature data from Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Scanners.!Sample_data_processing = Data was normalized using the 'asm' R package.  Due to the sensitivity profile of the MBD enrichment assay, probes in regions with a CpG density of less than 2.5% were discarded (leaving about 50k probes for analysis).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Martin,,Aryee!Sample_contact_email = aryee.martin@mgh.harvard.edu!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Massachusetts General Hospital!Sample_contact_address = 149 13th Street!Sample_contact_city = Charlestown!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02129!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM933nnn/GSM933889/suppl/GSM933889_BT_16075_SNP6.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38073!Sample_series_id = GSE38242!Sample_data_row_count = 0
