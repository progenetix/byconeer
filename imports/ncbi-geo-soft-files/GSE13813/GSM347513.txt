For samples with < 80% overall tumor cells, needle dissection of serial tumor sections was performed to enrich for the epithelial fraction prior to DNA extraction. Needle-dissected samples were stained with cresyl-violet to facilitate morphological distinction between tumor and stromal elements.!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Fresh-frozen (LN2) tissue collected at surgery.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted using a DNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturerâs protocol.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = The mapping array assays were performed according to the manufacturerâs protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was XbaI restriction digested, adapter ligated, PCR amplified, fragmented, labelled and hybridized to a 50K SNP XbaI array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were washed using an Affymetrix fluidics stations and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Mapping 100K Set Array (50K_Xba240_SNP).!Sample_data_processing = CEL files and TXT files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by dChip and model-based expression performed using the PM/MM model. Copy number normalization, batch correction and smoothing steps were performed using GISTIC as described in Beroukhim et al., 2007 (PMID 18077431) and Etemadmoghadam et al., in press.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number ratio was generated by normalizing each tumor sample to the mean of normal reference samples with similar baseline signal intensity profiles to minimize systematic noise resulting from undetermined experimental factors. We used the 5 closest references, measured by Euclidean distance between each normal and tumor signal profile. Additional normal (diploid) data (which supplement the 16 reference samples available from the current submission) were obtained from the Broad Institute, Boston (Beroukhim et al., 2007; GSE9635) and from the Affymetrix 100K HapMap Trio Dataset (available from https://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/sample_data/hapmap_trio_data.affx).!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Dariush,,Etemadmoghadam!Sample_contact_email = dariush.etemadmoghadam@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = 61396561149!Sample_contact_institute = Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = St Andrew's Place!Sample_contact_city = East Melbourne!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 3002!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM347nnn/GSM347513/suppl/GSM347513.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM347nnn/GSM347513/suppl/GSM347513.TXT.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE13813!Sample_data_row_count = 57446#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 tumor copy number ratio compared to the mean of normal (diploid) DNA references!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1738457	-0.369945SNP_A-1658232	-0.369945SNP_A-1678466	-0.369945SNP_A-1676440	-0.369945SNP_A-1662392	-0.369945SNP_A-1685736	-0.369945SNP_A-1681384	-0.369945SNP_A-1642581	-0.369945SNP_A-1669029	-0.369945SNP_A-1718237	-0.369945SNP_A-1748467	-0.369945SNP_A-1677302	-0.369945SNP_A-1705537	-0.369945SNP_A-1683756	-0.369945SNP_A-1696782	-0.369945SNP_A-1673422	-0.369945SNP_A-1701279	-0.369945SNP_A-1670878	-0.369945SNP_A-1743511	-0.369945SNP_A-1736635	-0.369945!sample_table_end
