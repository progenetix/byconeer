DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617677/suppl/GSM617677_OR1240.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617677/suppl/GSM617677_OR1240.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1121.71999	225.04229AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1137.73494	279.21372AFFX-SNP_10015773	BB	1559.81966	1995.39101AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	689.54099	433.39868AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1517.18807	1308.26186AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	521.37022	410.88039AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	612.29873	886.90076AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	461.09580	541.45167AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1048.57931	3577.63051AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	198.91910	849.55700AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	264.77077	1059.06441AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1510.78049	209.90311AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	800.52739	2163.48649AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	889.58794	1250.62983AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	541.59268	449.94093AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	1095.16664	893.71435AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	592.80658	1830.51976AFFX-SNP_10052664	AB	568.63478	568.93413AFFX-SNP_10057887	AA	677.47831	359.54074AFFX-SNP_10064911	BB	457.09428	1130.63017!sample_table_end
