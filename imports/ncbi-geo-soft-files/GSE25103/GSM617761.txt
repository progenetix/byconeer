DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617761/suppl/GSM617761_OR4070.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617761/suppl/GSM617761_OR4070.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	894.99567	295.23467AFFX-SNP_10009702	BB	361.81295	1075.00798AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1915.28202	1199.57193AFFX-SNP_10021569	AB	639.56667	544.84426AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	598.85928	1992.19878AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	465.08671	656.44667AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1020.10093	597.66910AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	430.49496	829.83811AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	916.83632	3725.22404AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	223.64905	994.64473AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	676.70513	647.16221AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1432.23257	227.35367AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	801.02166	2063.88993AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	224.20843	1562.60135AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	301.37284	611.70634AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	979.85385	788.21147AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	530.51942	2047.51590AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	320.90868	1037.24670AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	286.20154	949.50285AFFX-SNP_10064911	BB	465.14337	1170.47979!sample_table_end
