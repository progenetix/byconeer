DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617752/suppl/GSM617752_OR4003.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617752/suppl/GSM617752_OR4003.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1083.20244	212.03812AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	1077.85943	544.44950AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1563.81738	1449.25432AFFX-SNP_10021569	AB	593.48360	690.85966AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	628.07819	1817.15321AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	667.27648	465.08412AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	857.29019	796.53923AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	491.68018	619.40484AFFX-SNP_10037362	AB	2550.11899	2484.12108AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	229.71647	872.07258AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	279.85839	1188.12601AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1580.55277	234.74924AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	745.54367	1940.36934AFFX-SNP_10046830	AA	1407.07387	267.96435AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	490.35733	459.39326AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	802.41943	822.32171AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	473.07161	2032.77713AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	286.88224	1106.61922AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	226.93472	954.10169AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	947.40882	317.23571!sample_table_end
