DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617775/suppl/GSM617775_ON66.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617775/suppl/GSM617775_ON66.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	672.96160	1248.48262AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	822.47763	594.78898AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1445.70356	1441.24899AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	704.17740	330.22595AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1363.62812	1154.49908AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	357.21617	542.19843AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	803.63456	454.92612AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	303.44123	768.62622AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1009.42240	3722.47541AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	215.75428	939.09651AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	277.81931	995.38153AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1481.29080	183.27799AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	671.98066	1907.92759AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	784.22416	1082.45121AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	317.40711	641.61524AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1290.11838	383.11523AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1646.68597	1280.57717AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	244.48787	947.66119AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	588.14937	627.65121AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	641.36263	593.56255!sample_table_end
