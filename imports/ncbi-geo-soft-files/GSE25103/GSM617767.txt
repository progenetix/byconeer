DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617767/suppl/GSM617767_OR4146.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617767/suppl/GSM617767_OR4146.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1168.10240	223.40103AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1412.11129	274.00411AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1678.54821	1288.14749AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	782.32276	454.97224AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	563.48060	1951.22415AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	547.86029	437.55527AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	781.31633	1010.08419AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	372.59877	799.89852AFFX-SNP_10037362	AB	3810.02573	2638.79512AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	201.05467	833.33495AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	324.56094	1117.61896AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1344.37118	187.79768AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	799.99575	2059.98979AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	734.35958	1145.63991AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	673.57518	442.64351AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	838.52367	796.42480AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1863.84969	1713.22129AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	324.37426	1040.39154AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	412.82140	574.01822AFFX-SNP_10064911	BB	500.92931	1243.09807!sample_table_end
