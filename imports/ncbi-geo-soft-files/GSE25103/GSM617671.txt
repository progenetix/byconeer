DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617671/suppl/GSM617671_OR1008.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617671/suppl/GSM617671_OR1008.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	978.39406	243.19851AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	978.57853	268.92146AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	2151.90947	1098.64792AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	643.14979	375.65781AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	621.62729	1917.54508AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	398.07845	622.64391AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1139.74407	450.72857AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	566.86847	568.84638AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	978.86574	3535.38379AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	238.37816	897.02981AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	702.25664	514.81262AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1533.79313	209.98328AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	713.57035	1815.94253AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	260.39680	1779.74010AFFX-SNP_10047363	AA	764.40228	198.15095AFFX-SNP_10047841	BB	684.24824	1451.92669AFFX-SNP_10049334	AA	2612.23399	511.52609AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	285.89548	945.84311AFFX-SNP_10057887	AA	858.36839	501.48881AFFX-SNP_10064911	BB	588.78280	1150.23177!sample_table_end
