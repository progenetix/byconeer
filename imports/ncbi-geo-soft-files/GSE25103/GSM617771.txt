DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617771/suppl/GSM617771_OR4207.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617771/suppl/GSM617771_OR4207.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1137.03696	222.35261AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1507.70691	251.31537AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1471.20071	1478.44118AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	601.10563	360.18707AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	607.45387	1706.95999AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	376.91091	534.12453AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1179.25883	388.97119AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	512.49702	529.98049AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	900.52597	3540.43737AFFX-SNP_10037636	AB	638.83282	622.60063AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	788.25884	766.61786AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1616.34573	194.39986AFFX-SNP_10039933	AB	1252.44750	1223.25433AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	857.45253	1096.18933AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	298.36446	779.44021AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	872.46387	774.12171AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1657.79413	1108.57869AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	287.13195	999.07666AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	221.62243	715.60849AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	658.80747	569.09155!sample_table_end
