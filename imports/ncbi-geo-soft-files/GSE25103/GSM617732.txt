DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617732/suppl/GSM617732_OR3161.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617732/suppl/GSM617732_OR3161.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	BB	321.55069	2442.56294AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1372.22468	290.20444AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1661.06216	939.88190AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	817.25285	393.13472AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1351.75241	1254.31717AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	471.43175	491.52867AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1233.26226	388.17212AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	304.98703	763.48621AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	932.05170	3625.46397AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	212.16503	966.65542AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	809.42344	763.85842AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1453.74602	230.00428AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	752.61641	2107.79219AFFX-SNP_10046830	AA	1361.36515	275.46916AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	307.69570	666.57594AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	958.54475	322.20187AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1851.58492	1343.78924AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	271.49967	1045.83426AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	561.17596	555.43768AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	604.97019	782.60925!sample_table_end
