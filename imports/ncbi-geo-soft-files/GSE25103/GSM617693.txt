DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617693/suppl/GSM617693_OR1438.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617693/suppl/GSM617693_OR1438.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	658.95229	1668.13610AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1479.73606	267.46869AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1340.49005	1542.97575AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	707.28245	329.83884AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	585.53789	1937.31707AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	468.97573	480.41719AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	453.45718	711.89271AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	412.73489	484.63952AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	936.97395	3495.67036AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	198.34958	856.41888AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	288.26505	1106.22037AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1324.05522	207.93905AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	715.56526	1890.31305AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	759.60676	1046.42822AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	439.90624	488.84677AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1121.00674	332.45381AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1692.95820	1318.99426AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	280.71127	906.70470AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	243.33131	816.17333AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	665.72854	506.32232!sample_table_end
