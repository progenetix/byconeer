DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617695/suppl/GSM617695_OR2006.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617695/suppl/GSM617695_OR2006.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	990.46985	279.63165AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	591.90102	584.85334AFFX-SNP_10015773	BB	1207.54516	2244.33093AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	845.42591	376.38969AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1291.86028	1489.08158AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	371.44957	588.05790AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	1562.78933	1096.59364AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	312.47153	786.48228AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	977.73896	3640.65403AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	235.98344	844.89127AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	888.39752	808.07419AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1765.03295	204.21506AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	716.91723	2064.30554AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	802.59405	1252.70308AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	330.12787	675.31757AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	848.13189	905.19582AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	506.23145	1475.87193AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	313.97779	1009.97452AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	488.32794	608.34123AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	769.69724	1011.82101!sample_table_end
