DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617710/suppl/GSM617710_OR2348.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617710/suppl/GSM617710_OR2348.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	667.37779	1482.96201AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1282.40525	244.87351AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1716.20713	954.91822AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	648.82974	379.77846AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	715.11188	1956.09650AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	574.76144	465.14652AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1036.34005	407.77791AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	364.86136	867.27978AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	967.47545	3483.98414AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	272.47165	814.75130AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	295.56145	1025.47287AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1476.00995	225.30091AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	693.76510	2062.64586AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	725.48750	1157.43636AFFX-SNP_10047363	AA	697.81176	205.91200AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1251.31449	414.12980AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1813.85403	1254.33380AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	336.19921	1002.24666AFFX-SNP_10057887	AA	855.50531	427.39299AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	616.62807	616.59634!sample_table_end
