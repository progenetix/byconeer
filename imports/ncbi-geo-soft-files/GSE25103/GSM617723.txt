DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617723/suppl/GSM617723_OR3078.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617723/suppl/GSM617723_OR3078.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1171.55731	252.30641AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1078.83929	277.32082AFFX-SNP_10015773	BB	1368.29764	2093.81004AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	618.32349	413.55698AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1454.33068	1554.55107AFFX-SNP_10029725	AA	784.34166	389.28871AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1117.91208	400.88522AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	374.75400	705.75949AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1157.87370	3732.91344AFFX-SNP_10037636	AB	536.31895	416.03221AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	242.01008	1017.10304AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1431.17348	207.42314AFFX-SNP_10039933	AB	1439.01826	1265.95823AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	886.25157	1048.88128AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	299.90427	621.84866AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1320.59636	360.21492AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1534.94487	1305.68491AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	231.56291	777.67995AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	553.06610	618.46456AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	968.33813	272.31987!sample_table_end
