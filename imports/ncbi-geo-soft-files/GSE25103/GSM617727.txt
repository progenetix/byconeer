DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617727/suppl/GSM617727_OR3100.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617727/suppl/GSM617727_OR3100.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	772.96735	1893.22660AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	795.17825	489.80409AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	2023.87094	1730.83722AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	678.88165	410.31092AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	639.73436	2143.39350AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	474.63160	672.80119AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	983.05102	461.94134AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	518.34709	549.64650AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1239.41677	3661.26105AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	204.59229	561.69761AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	989.39563	468.86117AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1469.85559	190.44454AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	972.63403	1994.60833AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	295.88396	1837.12347AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	425.38341	411.21199AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	1197.13594	804.02276AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1706.51103	1425.73822AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	326.40946	907.88951AFFX-SNP_10057887	AA	680.55369	383.40661AFFX-SNP_10064911	NoCall	621.79955	1033.13604!sample_table_end
