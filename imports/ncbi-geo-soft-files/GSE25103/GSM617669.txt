DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617669/suppl/GSM617669_OR0989.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617669/suppl/GSM617669_OR0989.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	796.21125	1609.13880AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	726.77784	580.13391AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	2085.74655	1017.02864AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	785.91815	397.74491AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	615.83942	1762.25069AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	661.69789	500.68844AFFX-SNP_10034687	NoCall	857.38534	1143.61546AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	342.29036	890.77510AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	890.53798	3667.41815AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	239.35848	896.97864AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	955.63757	820.13383AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1511.55801	193.39301AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	698.79128	1886.32140AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	837.00209	1263.80291AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	562.06434	440.03051AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	768.22800	679.18438AFFX-SNP_10049334	AA	2601.51621	564.16791AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	283.99369	1122.92348AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	558.75262	573.93283AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	793.01437	763.77276!sample_table_end
