DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617729/suppl/GSM617729_OR3116.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617729/suppl/GSM617729_OR3116.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	692.43123	1986.12125AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1064.25772	259.10920AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	2044.67403	1002.45815AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	580.41161	359.78127AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	670.21517	1869.15619AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	393.46824	603.56527AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	741.22241	749.06471AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	505.58380	586.40288AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1154.45752	3396.73233AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	210.63172	719.73209AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	266.91163	985.88595AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1645.82746	230.83014AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	832.96893	1803.89677AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	812.55365	1122.63752AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	457.70158	438.77102AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1391.57153	365.05642AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1745.48319	1430.93090AFFX-SNP_10052664	AB	462.34666	451.29028AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	530.67386	684.83274AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	1185.11745	276.68747!sample_table_end
