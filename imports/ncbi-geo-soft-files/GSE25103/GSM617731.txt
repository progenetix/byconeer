DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617731/suppl/GSM617731_OR3157.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617731/suppl/GSM617731_OR3157.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	595.85315	1569.56570AFFX-SNP_10009702	BB	295.91078	760.71216AFFX-SNP_10015773	NoCall	2171.44329	1603.68033AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	540.75161	350.33337AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	608.24264	2015.20663AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	690.57614	483.39239AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	916.47299	1003.02334AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	609.37402	612.63270AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1217.09443	3493.92138AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	206.85745	704.82720AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	298.44785	872.28870AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1397.40391	207.76777AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	1069.97514	1994.48861AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	299.89169	1903.30761AFFX-SNP_10047363	AA	671.28553	254.34428AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1465.55998	430.79047AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	602.42514	1993.17565AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	258.73866	938.61806AFFX-SNP_10057887	NoCall	667.37345	481.10278AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	692.53839	741.29690!sample_table_end
