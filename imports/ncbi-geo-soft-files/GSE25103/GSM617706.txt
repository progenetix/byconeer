DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617706/suppl/GSM617706_OR2328.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617706/suppl/GSM617706_OR2328.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	BB	333.19210	2661.40878AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	837.53695	539.57625AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1581.88169	1606.25680AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	779.26370	453.60330AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	588.45853	1652.12270AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	542.53620	518.43061AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1387.89481	441.18675AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	447.95817	588.17299AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	849.47400	3491.14783AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	204.14531	834.32195AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	971.81207	761.47128AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1348.24338	221.10500AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	633.27896	1906.55248AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	883.52143	1152.44824AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	494.41033	548.73147AFFX-SNP_10047841	BB	524.45216	1513.58411AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	2058.91864	1153.21958AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	254.67722	1114.52135AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	283.37677	855.27608AFFX-SNP_10064911	BB	405.41384	1087.53348!sample_table_end
