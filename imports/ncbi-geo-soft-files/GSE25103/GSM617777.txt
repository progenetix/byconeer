DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617777/suppl/GSM617777_ON78.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617777/suppl/GSM617777_ON78.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	989.80222	214.16460AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	818.11063	507.50085AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1597.98312	1512.25265AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	727.48087	433.93258AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	604.36553	1563.92869AFFX-SNP_10029725	AA	630.29144	295.91450AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	418.08143	814.78490AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	393.93622	502.80717AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1109.15643	4014.99429AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	185.27423	749.39580AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	725.45370	648.56596AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1493.23334	211.13277AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	745.54293	1839.02870AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	261.24026	1819.43856AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	572.79716	512.99157AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	866.36235	794.32479AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1677.37047	1219.51120AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	265.28248	930.06064AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	259.46988	762.32914AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	709.76118	561.30680!sample_table_end
