DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617756/suppl/GSM617756_OR4041.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617756/suppl/GSM617756_OR4041.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1132.19868	249.74854AFFX-SNP_10009702	BB	297.15976	983.60879AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1850.62378	923.95086AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	710.45662	350.27871AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	694.43676	1933.31766AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	559.35145	455.25916AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1382.36540	408.68163AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	356.33865	705.37464AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	873.41013	3704.99265AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	217.34615	1021.98296AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	291.62113	1176.80207AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1383.93643	195.78043AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	753.13079	1932.73748AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	896.61260	1097.26519AFFX-SNP_10047363	AA	704.51249	228.32323AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1194.79603	353.44025AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1320.84069	1747.61569AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	290.74023	1006.86952AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	255.88169	718.07431AFFX-SNP_10064911	BB	418.66327	1033.48284!sample_table_end
