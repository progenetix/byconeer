DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617696/suppl/GSM617696_OR2069.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617696/suppl/GSM617696_OR2069.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	688.12767	1437.76709AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	737.87853	653.48742AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1605.51693	1770.94671AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	694.51395	414.48614AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	611.93487	1728.49774AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	310.15958	578.79377AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	861.56824	912.96833AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	296.13910	732.50475AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	952.94922	3450.81145AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	217.84260	1042.56732AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	844.95987	709.14147AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1315.94741	194.33972AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	599.62714	1909.74637AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	918.35744	1128.43843AFFX-SNP_10047363	AA	808.19331	254.73389AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	805.32765	844.53803AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	426.68026	1707.88025AFFX-SNP_10052664	AB	578.93707	735.95992AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	266.48963	797.57142AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	620.17363	716.68635!sample_table_end
