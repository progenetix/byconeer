DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617746/suppl/GSM617746_OR3294.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617746/suppl/GSM617746_OR3294.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1074.49988	198.69603AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1390.79117	248.67935AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1488.70713	1609.39698AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	745.67349	304.50700AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	607.61386	1778.58846AFFX-SNP_10029725	AA	713.91248	302.41213AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1004.77462	347.89026AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	308.57310	734.88973AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1008.09922	3426.52486AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	204.84766	898.39880AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	318.10148	1211.46760AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1580.68144	204.41054AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	644.24572	1794.42683AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	1072.41102	1100.67007AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	579.56153	491.19419AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	772.50419	746.58109AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1641.35303	1256.98649AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	268.15286	912.47324AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	607.05405	558.84103AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	1034.67767	236.93421!sample_table_end
