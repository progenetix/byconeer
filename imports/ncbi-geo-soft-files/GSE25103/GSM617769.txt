DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617769/suppl/GSM617769_OR4181.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617769/suppl/GSM617769_OR4181.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	735.02157	1460.38400AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	839.02211	638.14232AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1457.44915	1365.65211AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	737.74814	389.75937AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	636.01818	1915.86257AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	303.99549	529.30048AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	519.14918	845.08003AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	324.17297	757.40038AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	920.50217	3929.68990AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	229.29871	1083.67556AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	262.70320	1135.78639AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1337.86013	219.02536AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	625.51685	2059.75510AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	267.70454	1639.52754AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	515.90473	426.72958AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	777.41413	852.57459AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1686.59579	1195.57966AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	298.77165	907.06523AFFX-SNP_10057887	AA	774.36929	378.74775AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	577.21119	586.64434!sample_table_end
