DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617736/suppl/GSM617736_OR3234.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617736/suppl/GSM617736_OR3234.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	709.48480	1712.30053AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1019.21948	265.23241AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1808.32236	942.57208AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	699.58481	358.41334AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	650.18792	1894.56987AFFX-SNP_10029725	AA	861.11412	396.89397AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	415.06759	769.55826AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	657.05135	567.60881AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1036.92447	4014.42079AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	229.39731	700.99328AFFX-SNP_10039349	AA	1273.49830	278.93627AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1387.85681	194.00502AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	758.22324	1772.63712AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	711.02131	1321.38454AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	739.56694	482.11270AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	759.90586	927.38815AFFX-SNP_10049334	AA	3475.03975	614.32916AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	327.60584	899.87234AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	550.86547	646.55416AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	1007.20702	642.63196!sample_table_end
