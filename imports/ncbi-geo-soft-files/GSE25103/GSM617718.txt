DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617718/suppl/GSM617718_OR2461.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617718/suppl/GSM617718_OR2461.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1148.38322	262.93516AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	730.60304	493.15186AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1638.31769	1693.52604AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	683.77192	370.98696AFFX-SNP_10026879	AA	1835.99267	761.69864AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	386.08899	541.06350AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	868.88581	876.33435AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	287.41736	846.90692AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1027.50082	3587.33659AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	194.20676	820.98098AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	317.95778	1046.05469AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1398.53658	166.14994AFFX-SNP_10039933	AB	1241.58924	1263.73862AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	912.31347	1418.87668AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	300.22171	586.62337AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	1030.41948	847.98425AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1611.98005	1407.89245AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	266.44341	1063.18091AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	329.22933	770.82834AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	855.63604	270.83328!sample_table_end
