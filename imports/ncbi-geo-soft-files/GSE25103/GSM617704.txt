DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617704/suppl/GSM617704_OR2267.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617704/suppl/GSM617704_OR2267.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	NoCall	1162.60927	1435.94303AFFX-SNP_10009702	BB	356.40043	664.23563AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	2106.51353	1273.33106AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	955.87943	539.10041AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	694.14710	1987.93593AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	420.03569	539.98078AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1017.19511	517.79793AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	348.46871	821.58900AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1046.09787	3260.13288AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	189.45995	886.96474AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	908.78707	780.36283AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1446.55570	171.12646AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	834.69391	1946.14065AFFX-SNP_10046830	AA	1070.75365	536.81442AFFX-SNP_10047363	AA	727.30542	287.04429AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	1004.45175	726.38966AFFX-SNP_10049334	AA	2980.80098	686.46312AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	305.92984	814.60314AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	421.37037	521.25347AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	900.16071	624.03576!sample_table_end
