DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617724/suppl/GSM617724_OR3084.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617724/suppl/GSM617724_OR3084.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1159.76320	212.65361AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1211.96893	311.27553AFFX-SNP_10015773	BB	1283.36896	2067.12251AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	636.90153	392.67001AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	700.56757	1645.75382AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	619.31458	467.92763AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	751.06784	913.87602AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	347.04648	818.46063AFFX-SNP_10037362	AB	2804.34922	2480.40621AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	215.50100	860.97714AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	775.52386	548.23480AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1679.77906	202.47603AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	698.39830	1921.06002AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	323.70436	1965.50796AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	305.49086	663.21715AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	1005.13010	924.32133AFFX-SNP_10049334	AA	2333.48309	495.26756AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	281.20926	858.87058AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	298.73546	915.56950AFFX-SNP_10064911	BB	388.27069	1107.76329!sample_table_end
