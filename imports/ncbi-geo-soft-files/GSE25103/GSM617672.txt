DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617672/suppl/GSM617672_OR1016.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617672/suppl/GSM617672_OR1016.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	704.80674	1714.96670AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	1018.81470	691.76187AFFX-SNP_10015773	BB	1277.41577	2323.36228AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	757.63112	389.78454AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	763.55292	1863.28415AFFX-SNP_10029725	AA	800.05273	386.96345AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	835.76166	540.49479AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	348.33959	884.64048AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1031.95598	3616.52471AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	192.43991	799.97579AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	324.03256	1159.11933AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1340.96360	181.66655AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	777.55171	1708.61438AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	639.20486	1310.43897AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	637.88666	596.65282AFFX-SNP_10047841	BB	615.00924	1270.26571AFFX-SNP_10049334	AA	2702.78910	596.79809AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	325.42986	925.10497AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	638.58570	627.06667AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	708.45012	725.71067!sample_table_end
