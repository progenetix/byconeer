DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617743/suppl/GSM617743_OR3282.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617743/suppl/GSM617743_OR3282.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	728.35043	1539.79916AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1120.18702	306.43556AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1860.46319	1008.87499AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	628.63876	320.50891AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	678.71175	2125.40021AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	547.61072	490.65184AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	558.87839	338.01807AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	460.79384	621.60261AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1070.50330	3901.36990AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	236.43693	890.92831AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	277.61650	953.63079AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1697.98255	197.19792AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	690.69366	1835.69293AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	745.47528	1143.77576AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	654.73371	433.53732AFFX-SNP_10047841	BB	704.88216	1212.07272AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1460.57503	1483.18238AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	224.99234	948.03886AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	279.68345	893.87652AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	704.63884	772.26052!sample_table_end
