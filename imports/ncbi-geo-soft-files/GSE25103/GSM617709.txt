DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617709/suppl/GSM617709_OR2343.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617709/suppl/GSM617709_OR2343.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	596.05103	1580.91078AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1314.52337	296.18455AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1798.19833	1008.61741AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	799.71386	473.84912AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	544.01913	2069.59088AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	420.22655	747.96774AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	534.77165	940.85865AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	360.70924	779.98136AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	938.15027	3707.68663AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	298.02377	863.23862AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	255.57710	954.62545AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1428.52506	188.45133AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	731.97397	1770.25328AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	901.53415	1141.57401AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	275.22811	688.95059AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1071.38762	428.01328AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1848.26183	1347.19314AFFX-SNP_10052664	AB	530.71066	735.04265AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	557.03984	592.03134AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	748.49333	597.16305!sample_table_end
