DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617699/suppl/GSM617699_OR2186.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617699/suppl/GSM617699_OR2186.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1113.63344	216.68935AFFX-SNP_10009702	BB	413.05666	751.40254AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1690.99254	981.97468AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	630.78450	339.23934AFFX-SNP_10026879	AA	1702.40155	684.41367AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	407.49613	691.38260AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	421.99879	652.84226AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	310.75450	899.31029AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1130.01021	3353.05982AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	186.07344	853.36119AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	308.32655	1291.80555AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1535.66874	200.74269AFFX-SNP_10039933	AB	1438.59358	1338.06826AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	242.71675	1848.23866AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	535.44869	678.71290AFFX-SNP_10047841	BB	658.90148	1167.19100AFFX-SNP_10049334	NoCall	928.27772	1489.95345AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	276.87312	712.88596AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	234.61189	816.54396AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	596.68763	644.21406!sample_table_end
