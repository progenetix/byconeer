DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617663/suppl/GSM617663_OR0816.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617663/suppl/GSM617663_OR0816.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	721.71829	1130.45449AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1125.68659	251.46069AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1612.13726	1607.06756AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	692.58996	364.31720AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1519.65815	1545.80211AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	594.45104	577.99260AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	849.69156	454.82888AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	439.16744	529.17191AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1083.15793	3901.16497AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	241.30156	879.80312AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	751.24988	586.27675AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1303.40813	225.05655AFFX-SNP_10039933	AB	1710.39541	1222.56292AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	779.96401	1223.74621AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	482.63666	442.28818AFFX-SNP_10047841	BB	796.78066	1206.13090AFFX-SNP_10049334	AA	2850.34505	529.80844AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	298.03144	903.23054AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	531.56389	646.05491AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	660.30537	649.72042!sample_table_end
