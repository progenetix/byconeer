DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617702/suppl/GSM617702_OR2237.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617702/suppl/GSM617702_OR2237.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1350.30493	258.90761AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1248.52729	242.28611AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	2039.01837	1087.94024AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	792.05337	358.49098AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	714.37646	1802.86136AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	610.31254	430.11608AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1033.81860	422.47395AFFX-SNP_10036267	AA	665.28061	381.60152AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1058.22743	3804.21170AFFX-SNP_10037636	AB	477.84005	423.17841AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	339.22386	1191.92192AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1522.65997	211.15155AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	730.09662	1856.26078AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	255.43299	1835.22771AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	547.53165	505.91665AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	1127.02534	923.38927AFFX-SNP_10049334	AA	2584.33722	406.50076AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	327.99608	1035.84668AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	298.96943	744.72564AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	648.84075	888.60820!sample_table_end
