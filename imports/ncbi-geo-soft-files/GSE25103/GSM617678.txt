DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617678/suppl/GSM617678_OR1260.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617678/suppl/GSM617678_OR1260.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1143.88086	231.02749AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1259.13200	303.18462AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1973.74559	1004.95273AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	678.87839	352.14545AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	674.26391	1776.37051AFFX-SNP_10029725	NoCall	703.10341	401.07421AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	876.43046	373.11306AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	531.59662	574.87302AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1162.28945	4757.66786AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	220.94806	995.06831AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	330.51693	1070.01302AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1508.40240	272.97290AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	845.23112	1992.29491AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	264.96168	1863.63423AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	652.05601	452.80307AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	980.69153	821.49653AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	433.33694	1970.55457AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	282.35118	951.63430AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	511.48376	724.03245AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	800.88658	717.01491!sample_table_end
