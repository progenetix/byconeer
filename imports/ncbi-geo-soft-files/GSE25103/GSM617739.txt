DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617739/suppl/GSM617739_OR3246.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617739/suppl/GSM617739_OR3246.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	687.04676	1617.84459AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1392.09858	253.38536AFFX-SNP_10015773	BB	1123.56036	1962.20838AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	741.02748	352.94529AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1245.91942	1302.89673AFFX-SNP_10029725	AA	603.38236	309.91116AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	750.20967	745.95280AFFX-SNP_10036267	AA	505.38589	328.76662AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	990.16276	3665.67843AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	229.67444	809.60953AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	735.35021	640.56206AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1403.43168	219.66934AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	688.59251	1815.95261AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	271.73027	1742.90980AFFX-SNP_10047363	AA	668.40068	198.93335AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1086.30096	309.60829AFFX-SNP_10049334	AA	2743.06062	455.87704AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	255.52511	940.91804AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	552.35303	623.49993AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	638.31806	691.88671!sample_table_end
