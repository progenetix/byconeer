DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617730/suppl/GSM617730_OR3149.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617730/suppl/GSM617730_OR3149.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1095.03853	213.07197AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	978.13970	283.77395AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1709.30731	974.31414AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	631.88796	410.60336AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1372.19365	1238.18874AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	531.95639	434.09486AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	471.73681	846.89188AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	461.54857	587.01100AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	976.79100	3582.00542AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	234.67324	875.55279AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	273.43214	1013.76047AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1573.70073	184.71389AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	687.33145	1862.01079AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	788.70967	1142.26034AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	343.81039	668.07817AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	974.68959	800.13579AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1570.49682	1144.63769AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	271.29709	917.48952AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	509.13312	603.76174AFFX-SNP_10064911	BB	482.55687	1242.09847!sample_table_end
