DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617703/suppl/GSM617703_OR2266.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617703/suppl/GSM617703_OR2266.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	970.95067	184.50722AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1239.29054	274.48020AFFX-SNP_10015773	BB	1358.34930	2258.70511AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	718.35346	371.61462AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1353.62597	1449.00815AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	501.82486	444.35944AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	886.80443	392.63008AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	322.07577	669.90001AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1111.60843	4418.40235AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	179.30384	881.31579AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	303.20187	1045.78479AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1409.57524	232.19500AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	691.39954	2032.82710AFFX-SNP_10046830	AA	1394.65376	300.69088AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	586.83449	474.25604AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1116.85011	341.11288AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1688.27772	1752.76005AFFX-SNP_10052664	AB	656.56559	648.95547AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	493.60222	686.86262AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	1051.32345	244.08731!sample_table_end
