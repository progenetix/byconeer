DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617773/suppl/GSM617773_ON57.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617773/suppl/GSM617773_ON57.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	669.66863	1262.07500AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1163.84733	301.86268AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1438.20066	1481.31504AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	851.83790	471.97236AFFX-SNP_10026879	AA	1916.22632	614.23755AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	496.57215	443.57399AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	960.77338	380.47886AFFX-SNP_10036267	AA	574.13260	265.28720AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	853.99553	3645.60245AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	169.71920	1073.95693AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	267.42112	1086.07820AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1406.41362	199.48119AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	578.49085	1840.79935AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	259.85562	1817.41432AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	404.29225	819.03173AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1052.37676	329.59298AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1618.87431	1223.33441AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	300.01103	1200.25405AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	591.91802	596.27593AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	598.45814	684.97566!sample_table_end
