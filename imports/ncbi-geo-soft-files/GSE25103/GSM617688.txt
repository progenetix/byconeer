DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617688/suppl/GSM617688_OR1349.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617688/suppl/GSM617688_OR1349.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	764.71467	1521.60761AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	796.33731	487.45702AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	2062.74393	1156.26566AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	652.50515	433.58120AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	775.69192	1967.93985AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	783.32434	552.48238AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1160.64474	469.70467AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	412.98200	898.12425AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	998.20970	3602.18083AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	202.62465	811.04768AFFX-SNP_10039349	AA	1142.05370	270.61337AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1629.93847	188.42574AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	816.64771	1974.54884AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	306.30296	2156.68524AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	597.44492	494.85771AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1232.98473	432.37305AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	600.54529	2026.02195AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	371.43990	1115.78642AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	590.34169	658.23482AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	786.17207	724.35848!sample_table_end
