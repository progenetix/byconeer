DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617691/suppl/GSM617691_OR1414.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617691/suppl/GSM617691_OR1414.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1312.28605	229.79338AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1084.53090	309.05779AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1856.43908	1800.07224AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	701.06939	366.37415AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	653.21860	1938.18564AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	654.15811	465.12983AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1349.17757	475.77353AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	376.30015	688.61417AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1053.91452	3311.89508AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	202.21703	633.41632AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	274.01322	1000.75448AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1419.67912	181.90703AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	831.45014	1917.25069AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	926.67987	1263.79012AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	551.56240	517.81997AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1323.26594	404.03527AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	541.85405	1747.94433AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	371.87429	916.01654AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	214.61223	707.72341AFFX-SNP_10064911	BB	499.67862	1049.60527!sample_table_end
