DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617717/suppl/GSM617717_OR2451.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617717/suppl/GSM617717_OR2451.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	742.22854	1399.06251AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	849.08693	570.62932AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1752.23941	956.44537AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	752.21168	365.90176AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	2297.30315	1385.25297AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	526.22694	426.42180AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	738.14132	401.36222AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	298.48606	824.71643AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1043.99396	3513.15619AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	217.22343	753.72985AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	286.92001	1214.95553AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1333.77370	211.26366AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	811.19527	1976.41006AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	960.31333	1123.45402AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	622.70147	467.01556AFFX-SNP_10047841	BB	642.38163	1390.64015AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	400.64818	2080.53936AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	283.02732	1077.74404AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	566.47492	564.35921AFFX-SNP_10064911	BB	516.09142	1231.70035!sample_table_end
