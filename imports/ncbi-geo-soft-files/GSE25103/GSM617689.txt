DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617689/suppl/GSM617689_OR1376.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617689/suppl/GSM617689_OR1376.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1041.30825	206.05998AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1156.33473	284.63769AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1896.97963	1156.25559AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	698.30868	431.15335AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1400.06880	1408.24906AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	619.80271	467.32963AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	985.40131	997.56990AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	372.57295	816.73139AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1087.75339	4025.28893AFFX-SNP_10037636	AB	546.31476	666.24586AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	290.90496	982.89491AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1520.56274	192.98487AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	719.80077	2047.13750AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	277.37050	1622.60194AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	308.29799	788.33384AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	898.03389	817.39441AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1726.88965	1310.35894AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	309.02089	1043.84560AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	591.97652	703.32403AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	876.67145	298.26848!sample_table_end
