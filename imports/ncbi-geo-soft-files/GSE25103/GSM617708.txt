DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617708/suppl/GSM617708_OR2341.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617708/suppl/GSM617708_OR2341.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	759.23031	1778.35874AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	826.00893	688.09380AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1499.36364	1569.63186AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	696.31744	337.68969AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	602.80968	1751.51537AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	354.00029	599.16787AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	808.89917	404.79594AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	355.47639	828.32479AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	931.97717	3459.66790AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	260.88078	769.94473AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	310.80788	1069.59607AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1582.27040	234.60437AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	715.25427	1766.70984AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	229.67144	2120.98421AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	302.04386	895.24623AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	781.42764	764.98968AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	475.15024	1972.56253AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	234.85951	911.06789AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	535.09870	633.06263AFFX-SNP_10064911	BB	400.31089	1256.42909!sample_table_end
