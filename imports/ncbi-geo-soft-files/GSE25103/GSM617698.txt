DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617698/suppl/GSM617698_OR2138.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617698/suppl/GSM617698_OR2138.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1049.83250	216.31607AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	835.48952	597.50874AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1700.63930	948.82111AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	798.95132	361.12416AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	646.37979	1867.57604AFFX-SNP_10029725	AA	635.61941	307.87424AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	981.99085	393.33908AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	330.76245	733.11545AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	904.19482	3752.62422AFFX-SNP_10037636	AB	477.00569	562.98046AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	861.28456	686.66632AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1388.98975	212.87611AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	675.84443	2107.52851AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	280.26979	2079.01327AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	356.70103	820.45875AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1025.35600	351.10844AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1838.19585	1431.10027AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	260.93332	879.57823AFFX-SNP_10057887	AA	762.16405	335.49370AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	855.96576	253.16614!sample_table_end
