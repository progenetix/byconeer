DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617748/suppl/GSM617748_OR3326.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617748/suppl/GSM617748_OR3326.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1055.25617	246.30538AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	802.79259	546.57255AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1633.84058	1378.96842AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	608.29462	259.89210AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	583.50074	1735.41537AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	501.21839	384.81826AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	852.28304	315.28919AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	364.31192	703.67882AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1008.45661	3596.11529AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	184.93664	885.72345AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	804.85326	640.85274AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1591.01914	221.77721AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	703.75476	1914.41645AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	245.36998	1906.72032AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	517.75194	461.90242AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	912.78963	897.54226AFFX-SNP_10049334	AA	2640.88473	456.97347AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	269.72837	1051.02348AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	510.72578	522.36453AFFX-SNP_10064911	BB	384.01666	1015.58230!sample_table_end
