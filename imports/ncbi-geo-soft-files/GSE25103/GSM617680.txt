DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617680/suppl/GSM617680_OR1272.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617680/suppl/GSM617680_OR1272.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	704.16704	1571.38328AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	870.87858	744.12354AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1610.80046	1603.44000AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	716.18393	342.42175AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	615.51433	1876.90526AFFX-SNP_10029725	AA	794.82468	346.86865AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	884.81412	380.37853AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	471.72000	625.65571AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1029.27291	3816.61995AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	238.67126	871.08738AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	248.58693	1035.88398AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1536.20610	234.80186AFFX-SNP_10039933	AB	1413.99437	1405.72815AFFX-SNP_10046830	AA	1356.20602	340.77448AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	295.88061	759.47802AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	946.11108	885.51367AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1850.08933	1217.20303AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	279.28519	932.17750AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	277.56410	834.10239AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	712.20493	756.06743!sample_table_end
