DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617711/suppl/GSM617711_OR2360.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617711/suppl/GSM617711_OR2360.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	BB	301.59531	2103.11440AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1088.47739	265.46084AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1915.84097	869.37946AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	722.73263	370.20668AFFX-SNP_10026879	AA	2050.40008	632.91369AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	492.30122	456.88055AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	554.86924	357.02746AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	343.25690	853.97259AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1041.17957	4149.24672AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	213.93570	800.53680AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	285.37063	1097.90551AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1373.63133	191.27064AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	737.16974	2125.69430AFFX-SNP_10046830	AA	1455.50363	294.99308AFFX-SNP_10047363	AA	773.57653	170.51592AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1241.18504	416.16298AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	2065.00004	1582.38101AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	286.75190	967.93900AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	596.94441	735.45670AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	602.75950	731.78433!sample_table_end
