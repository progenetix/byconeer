DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617780/suppl/GSM617780_ON81.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617780/suppl/GSM617780_ON81.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1033.10891	198.33189AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	878.93371	592.79919AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1704.79056	796.82206AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	749.53850	394.65353AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	590.50962	1719.63679AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	325.92512	547.38825AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1021.04179	381.75992AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	350.36773	829.38307AFFX-SNP_10037362	AB	2545.07940	2530.77949AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	212.91088	882.89451AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	285.92981	1137.35229AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1425.36025	221.68412AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	696.04551	1948.65874AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	295.45749	1719.70866AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	359.83213	727.86006AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	732.00329	984.07278AFFX-SNP_10049334	AA	2828.10651	465.09733AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	260.82617	1034.54308AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	609.81864	688.10238AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	653.40611	670.56001!sample_table_end
