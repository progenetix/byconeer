DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617779/suppl/GSM617779_ON80.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617779/suppl/GSM617779_ON80.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1110.19831	213.48918AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1290.80802	244.76058AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1478.20879	1325.28372AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	847.29967	398.99881AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	595.16529	1683.39474AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	501.57995	369.89530AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	869.04562	778.27718AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	329.22832	812.59392AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	925.78857	3881.52375AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	217.41609	938.48894AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	805.61090	683.07099AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1411.18358	207.03679AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	654.46671	1819.64628AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	948.88586	1048.38008AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	252.28523	746.47013AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	839.13248	818.18404AFFX-SNP_10049334	AA	2960.02439	436.44243AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	278.05882	977.44339AFFX-SNP_10057887	AA	925.00375	351.28763AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	610.69382	552.68694!sample_table_end
