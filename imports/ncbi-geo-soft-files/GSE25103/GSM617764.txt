DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617764/suppl/GSM617764_OR4119.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617764/suppl/GSM617764_OR4119.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1129.84971	190.90123AFFX-SNP_10009702	BB	403.97540	943.11972AFFX-SNP_10015773	NoCall	1345.09649	1647.52659AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	707.07002	446.48077AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1572.42593	1366.97320AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	367.07901	649.62980AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	543.71765	791.39629AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	322.26096	889.78367AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1014.15011	4051.71341AFFX-SNP_10037636	AB	578.16752	521.57345AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	258.32574	1174.44741AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1580.99516	187.05870AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	765.93346	2028.11383AFFX-SNP_10046830	AA	1499.75565	308.24971AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	311.43423	562.63599AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	869.92531	807.94168AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1642.81744	1260.80240AFFX-SNP_10052664	AB	503.81825	646.98441AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	268.28247	761.58338AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	684.48031	695.78886!sample_table_end
