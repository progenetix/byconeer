DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617734/suppl/GSM617734_OR3191.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617734/suppl/GSM617734_OR3191.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1361.62497	241.67633AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	856.86012	594.42503AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1912.48430	981.96244AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	616.96037	343.16263AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	677.39031	1834.35792AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	449.68186	432.62097AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	665.17350	381.13417AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	339.80727	835.23317AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	993.51570	3428.77651AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	196.59132	802.70837AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	264.36512	902.96721AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1620.46197	230.65556AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	682.98362	1845.33341AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	779.80348	670.62771AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	536.24445	402.69340AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	1377.05291	904.92586AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1780.71224	1293.14563AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	252.84357	1128.00120AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	536.88151	657.42416AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	906.50048	277.87070!sample_table_end
