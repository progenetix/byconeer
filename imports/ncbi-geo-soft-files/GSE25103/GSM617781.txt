DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617781/suppl/GSM617781_ON82.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617781/suppl/GSM617781_ON82.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1027.92804	242.94490AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1278.72539	263.59728AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1761.02864	1002.67251AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	785.01303	475.09569AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1509.00046	1481.20923AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	527.87773	391.91667AFFX-SNP_10034687	BB	405.59823	1385.79770AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	426.45709	587.90293AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	915.29986	3703.10331AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	216.33446	875.06713AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	357.52052	1046.99597AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1257.60674	221.76304AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	725.15726	2017.30823AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	929.28869	1055.55890AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	547.59822	539.99861AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	754.42073	921.36616AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1956.90031	1299.79058AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	306.62335	1158.15968AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	552.41177	579.88174AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	674.71131	731.99124!sample_table_end
