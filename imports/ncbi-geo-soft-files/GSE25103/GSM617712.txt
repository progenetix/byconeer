DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617712/suppl/GSM617712_OR2378.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617712/suppl/GSM617712_OR2378.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1220.39765	287.21419AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1415.21037	283.32265AFFX-SNP_10015773	NoCall	1796.97138	1322.86357AFFX-SNP_10021569	NoCall	672.11271	518.32409AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1548.94844	1254.30480AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	526.52381	463.94996AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1097.56791	540.58504AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	420.96283	632.91153AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	990.98688	3566.99980AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	204.27563	784.27484AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	737.46973	688.46460AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1328.86782	196.61658AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	737.26777	1863.56635AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	282.42669	2095.88835AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	335.05273	779.72138AFFX-SNP_10047841	BB	655.60059	1264.64954AFFX-SNP_10049334	AA	2672.97031	560.88973AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	323.51280	941.74617AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	456.13263	604.06689AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	850.83770	632.51913!sample_table_end
