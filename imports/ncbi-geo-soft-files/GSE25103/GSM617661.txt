DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617661/suppl/GSM617661_OR0752.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617661/suppl/GSM617661_OR0752.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	768.59302	1760.82861AFFX-SNP_10009702	BB	493.33322	729.69717AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1891.41302	1923.25257AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	742.01250	396.40761AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1687.69717	1506.86143AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	405.07453	720.41506AFFX-SNP_10034687	NoCall	906.97626	592.28797AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	359.78248	951.00577AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1078.82453	3685.40277AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	183.64224	903.35696AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	302.55203	1162.32444AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1437.89966	230.07386AFFX-SNP_10039933	AB	1386.85190	1431.44031AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	837.30257	1137.66806AFFX-SNP_10047363	AA	704.48848	279.70314AFFX-SNP_10047841	BB	695.12404	1363.89271AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1710.64139	1386.03025AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	378.20916	955.74149AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	560.46776	599.55089AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	1133.61276	329.43970!sample_table_end
