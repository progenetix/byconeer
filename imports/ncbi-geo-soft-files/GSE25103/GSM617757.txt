DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617757/suppl/GSM617757_OR4043.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617757/suppl/GSM617757_OR4043.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1180.38016	228.34800AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1115.76527	247.76073AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1623.07661	936.39012AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	632.59259	452.65785AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1482.54742	1362.63242AFFX-SNP_10029725	NoCall	425.77624	472.73090AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	914.28733	407.97462AFFX-SNP_10036267	AA	670.02792	354.64944AFFX-SNP_10037362	AB	2598.27073	2290.42940AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	200.45797	918.08476AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	1083.66055	742.03367AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1572.60750	179.45275AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	743.35747	1845.11730AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	287.55636	1657.01635AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	534.06636	325.67278AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1331.52745	386.83776AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1236.69691	1457.35312AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	281.62036	972.51042AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	273.97009	663.00619AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	848.05779	261.06291!sample_table_end
