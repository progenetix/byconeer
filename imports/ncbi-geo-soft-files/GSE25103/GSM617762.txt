DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617762/suppl/GSM617762_OR4081.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617762/suppl/GSM617762_OR4081.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	646.77087	1487.15217AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1299.45778	312.67158AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1538.68229	1596.26128AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	796.00565	439.52383AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	529.77151	1680.28673AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	574.90586	446.68660AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1535.20920	421.12388AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	430.12407	575.55876AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1010.57687	3420.21829AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	155.33196	983.01434AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	307.98176	1005.98085AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1442.91162	175.16749AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	811.34288	2008.29567AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	730.65209	972.49084AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	509.03078	368.17088AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	831.40837	804.88037AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1703.91653	1276.58180AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	295.04911	1128.92941AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	501.60232	629.30545AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	658.66202	634.65091!sample_table_end
