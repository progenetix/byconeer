DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617664/suppl/GSM617664_OR0918.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617664/suppl/GSM617664_OR0918.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1254.20787	208.64886AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	744.02933	571.12482AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1728.99667	1617.09543AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	917.43222	386.71219AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1419.68404	1398.30502AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	507.19961	446.68668AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	643.56461	383.09979AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	427.08220	564.51078AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1065.26481	3711.41725AFFX-SNP_10037636	AB	541.77473	384.57418AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	300.18581	914.72665AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1319.82143	215.30333AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	719.57642	2195.40784AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	235.79796	2103.79849AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	540.24292	583.69538AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1086.54260	343.71965AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	356.15093	1638.36752AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	294.08729	795.71878AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	277.20787	873.78784AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	802.53047	640.01242!sample_table_end
