DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617740/suppl/GSM617740_OR3265.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617740/suppl/GSM617740_OR3265.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1266.96385	236.44246AFFX-SNP_10009702	NoCall	670.81835	764.13424AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1632.67332	1449.95817AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	591.02215	372.04414AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	593.76770	1810.12231AFFX-SNP_10029725	AA	754.74244	319.34611AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	853.41937	1006.78485AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	463.56992	538.16818AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1020.22971	3499.94273AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	182.57342	865.77766AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	281.97509	948.06836AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1503.23212	201.01260AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	716.31286	1891.99160AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	795.80278	1210.00533AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	315.14280	701.53181AFFX-SNP_10047841	BB	621.77331	1202.28170AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1515.65645	1237.31704AFFX-SNP_10052664	AB	498.00628	603.17033AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	273.21252	795.07956AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	759.25256	626.09675!sample_table_end
