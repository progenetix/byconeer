DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617728/suppl/GSM617728_OR3115.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617728/suppl/GSM617728_OR3115.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	717.18772	1817.31965AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1149.16258	252.15652AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1807.91712	808.71127AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	611.24401	340.42775AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	636.94213	1967.98899AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	404.68203	556.66028AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	701.46673	923.89655AFFX-SNP_10036267	AA	769.97693	309.02294AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1153.48961	4435.66999AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	185.90115	793.12571AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	636.55121	597.06498AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1617.71952	214.19473AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	653.67015	1889.84178AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	252.95695	2174.96946AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	621.18959	474.48781AFFX-SNP_10047841	BB	589.86655	1258.85919AFFX-SNP_10049334	AA	2606.45717	526.85831AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	278.58049	1040.30743AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	565.96423	611.04812AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	627.27485	905.07838!sample_table_end
