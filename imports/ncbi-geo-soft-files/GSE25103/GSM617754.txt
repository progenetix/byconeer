DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617754/suppl/GSM617754_OR4015.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617754/suppl/GSM617754_OR4015.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1094.63427	186.43360AFFX-SNP_10009702	BB	353.79079	949.33158AFFX-SNP_10015773	BB	1271.68373	1998.84619AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	819.87403	434.45927AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1419.79222	1642.56388AFFX-SNP_10029725	NoCall	462.40185	504.41561AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1402.94015	412.40070AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	399.93488	561.38652AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	915.34142	3481.73217AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	231.11526	900.62772AFFX-SNP_10039349	NoCall	639.12745	1119.52127AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1560.21026	214.10040AFFX-SNP_10039933	AB	1335.98847	1179.26497AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	332.76046	1925.68398AFFX-SNP_10047363	AA	747.24550	217.78199AFFX-SNP_10047841	BB	602.03334	1304.57166AFFX-SNP_10049334	AA	2783.40902	505.64309AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	288.14808	1096.32148AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	297.72469	838.46197AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	884.15014	292.00391!sample_table_end
