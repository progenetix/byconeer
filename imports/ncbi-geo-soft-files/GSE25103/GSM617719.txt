DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617719/suppl/GSM617719_OR2470.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617719/suppl/GSM617719_OR2470.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	BB	285.44522	2611.24575AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1268.34926	297.28564AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1908.65241	1114.70860AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	790.33787	380.96346AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	587.89700	1888.30538AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	465.00045	499.67994AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	702.74661	829.20865AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	505.05379	471.86222AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1195.14347	3675.59992AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	202.25215	880.46079AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	276.05439	930.15220AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1350.95248	194.35854AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	889.16740	2126.16285AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	768.96884	1354.94053AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	621.08951	482.44370AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1087.55631	377.22309AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1749.77891	1361.42059AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	317.03976	810.11966AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	465.72140	571.81114AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	1000.13999	265.58488!sample_table_end
