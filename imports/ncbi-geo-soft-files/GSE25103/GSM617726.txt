DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617726/suppl/GSM617726_OR3088.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617726/suppl/GSM617726_OR3088.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	674.67073	1771.70238AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1460.67341	296.25619AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1517.46997	828.04032AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	681.17615	329.92458AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1640.06383	1180.60828AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	587.76933	509.03696AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	703.65541	790.91738AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	365.97014	908.64366AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1013.81177	3940.69899AFFX-SNP_10037636	AB	675.51251	424.13287AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	264.65930	1278.72301AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1405.86358	200.68555AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	625.62760	1748.77725AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	958.25492	1027.56253AFFX-SNP_10047363	AA	924.06278	352.18976AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1248.13805	355.70233AFFX-SNP_10049334	AA	3321.85447	954.85714AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	249.23158	1013.24645AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	745.36143	671.39800AFFX-SNP_10064911	NoCall	942.58863	442.55045!sample_table_end
