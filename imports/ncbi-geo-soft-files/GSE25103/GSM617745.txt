DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617745/suppl/GSM617745_OR3289.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617745/suppl/GSM617745_OR3289.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	974.09439	256.05850AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1029.81221	273.39928AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1931.40684	1295.58952AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	588.25792	329.10450AFFX-SNP_10026879	AA	1929.61115	720.98284AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	672.39460	440.44715AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	986.95610	512.97272AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	379.54206	920.09637AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1089.87559	3700.33874AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	216.51824	770.14924AFFX-SNP_10039349	AA	1082.97931	214.30227AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1648.92291	200.76040AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	981.16896	1891.36596AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	259.72608	1800.60355AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	386.85241	576.27319AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	1181.69492	928.41927AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1746.37537	1377.30387AFFX-SNP_10052664	AB	562.81116	634.78884AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	550.01510	621.99864AFFX-SNP_10064911	BB	495.57747	1218.55325!sample_table_end
