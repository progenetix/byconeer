DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617701/suppl/GSM617701_OR2231.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617701/suppl/GSM617701_OR2231.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	BB	334.71457	2360.76579AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1421.41729	282.54273AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1742.37111	1541.84790AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	685.59599	385.01447AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1413.00292	1418.82325AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	594.61958	438.76543AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1083.63794	447.74774AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	428.66547	467.05950AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1081.00760	3790.44563AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	189.99990	895.08674AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	251.74406	1005.03398AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1426.18727	168.84686AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	864.13280	2045.99514AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	247.15735	1939.55006AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	512.28554	423.28219AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	977.85742	700.73180AFFX-SNP_10049334	AA	3036.60757	477.75920AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	291.83477	927.53616AFFX-SNP_10057887	AA	718.09313	329.17363AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	666.37863	649.35386!sample_table_end
