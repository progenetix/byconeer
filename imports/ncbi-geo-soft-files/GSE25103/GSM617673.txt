DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617673/suppl/GSM617673_OR1019.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617673/suppl/GSM617673_OR1019.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	986.52230	283.36271AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	677.53815	669.61308AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1984.21942	1068.84637AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	822.42151	480.87258AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	591.69637	1982.89586AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	682.67612	508.93704AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1173.88606	451.40921AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	400.69706	822.77206AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	988.61699	3505.07350AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	219.05934	828.74670AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	306.00947	1170.98685AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1370.99218	193.08646AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	748.08381	1663.00159AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	249.22460	1779.39234AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	371.86112	740.66230AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1383.40238	402.70142AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	535.38193	1811.07272AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	309.68505	1043.84420AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	251.18350	743.77369AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	796.20013	813.71345!sample_table_end
