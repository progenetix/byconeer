DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617665/suppl/GSM617665_OR0923.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617665/suppl/GSM617665_OR0923.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	978.77553	366.14420AFFX-SNP_10009702	BB	264.57501	816.30011AFFX-SNP_10015773	BB	1163.44111	1971.94453AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	804.48578	388.74710AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	706.67182	1791.91192AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	371.22128	629.54502AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1039.43376	410.54683AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	324.96377	844.66871AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	838.17485	3429.46862AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	207.93318	890.83656AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	936.39604	748.30809AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1493.96684	163.91107AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	652.42444	1859.51101AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	270.42897	2003.59710AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	332.69182	826.26248AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	742.64244	880.90164AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1777.51770	1285.67328AFFX-SNP_10052664	AB	668.96927	708.62610AFFX-SNP_10057887	AA	838.62086	431.06541AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	956.41275	269.83698!sample_table_end
