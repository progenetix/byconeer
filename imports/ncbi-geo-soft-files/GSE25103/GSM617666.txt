DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617666/suppl/GSM617666_OR0936.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617666/suppl/GSM617666_OR0936.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	764.73701	1507.06515AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	566.73223	442.44839AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1866.16574	1073.99060AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	711.56541	411.07558AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	661.75432	1880.05917AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	467.79567	586.39185AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	582.07275	464.11861AFFX-SNP_10036267	AA	615.67048	332.45333AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	967.80432	3914.30538AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	254.67940	714.85059AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	295.73654	1212.47733AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1936.06193	201.80839AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	803.83218	1502.50224AFFX-SNP_10046830	AA	1346.98844	323.20175AFFX-SNP_10047363	AA	722.31048	271.57552AFFX-SNP_10047841	BB	644.80194	1179.46525AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	407.44129	1679.25454AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	327.57371	1054.48073AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	619.31442	617.68493AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	967.77091	1219.19227!sample_table_end
