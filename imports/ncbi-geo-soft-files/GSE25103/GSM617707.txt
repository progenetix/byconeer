DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617707/suppl/GSM617707_OR2332.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617707/suppl/GSM617707_OR2332.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1132.75837	212.96564AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1353.14009	259.80291AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1892.67892	1114.02300AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	818.62955	411.85509AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1337.02760	1477.76122AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	401.31125	604.94276AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1359.76704	440.19840AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	487.76738	581.75146AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1038.04324	3489.24240AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	193.01310	942.01549AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	719.16906	666.84957AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1389.49103	193.51144AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	725.64350	1905.40920AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	734.55977	1049.17494AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	298.44776	533.26676AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	1081.39162	890.45928AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	444.37876	1490.78668AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	371.46360	1232.09391AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	554.39176	646.52821AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	674.11493	580.16657!sample_table_end
