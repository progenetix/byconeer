DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617684/suppl/GSM617684_OR1293.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617684/suppl/GSM617684_OR1293.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1179.03078	235.23304AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	919.19259	461.84728AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	2002.86098	970.43903AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	688.96760	387.64307AFFX-SNP_10026879	AA	1884.29184	707.54868AFFX-SNP_10029725	AA	992.88945	356.25184AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	503.64554	809.99640AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	531.13498	828.49177AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1016.07800	3405.12320AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	225.83234	747.23421AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	335.42485	1216.27363AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1570.17246	200.29499AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	723.98159	2027.32653AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	269.93467	1810.67372AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	361.21732	744.29504AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	982.86240	815.42221AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1139.85683	1535.49450AFFX-SNP_10052664	AB	613.83886	630.23206AFFX-SNP_10057887	AA	762.82812	372.72084AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	971.22341	813.63352!sample_table_end
