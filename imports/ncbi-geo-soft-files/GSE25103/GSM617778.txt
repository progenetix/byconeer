DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617778/suppl/GSM617778_ON79.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617778/suppl/GSM617778_ON79.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1063.06562	233.70861AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1168.23329	282.86624AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1811.97502	849.09289AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	623.78624	373.88917AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	615.63837	1617.08362AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	504.87180	442.97228AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	730.30869	840.05908AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	481.65416	510.96706AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	998.40606	3628.92774AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	218.29050	819.14618AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	291.32587	1059.96290AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1431.11793	226.94024AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	783.26545	1886.23063AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	927.45312	1151.61404AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	523.19360	531.05065AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	842.52811	835.51165AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1894.71974	1309.99078AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	293.62706	1011.87664AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	322.47511	783.13803AFFX-SNP_10064911	BB	379.63726	888.83538!sample_table_end
