DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617722/suppl/GSM617722_OR3076.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617722/suppl/GSM617722_OR3076.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	672.63612	1264.46065AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	579.66045	560.67539AFFX-SNP_10015773	BB	1411.81807	2164.36193AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	713.45056	313.17003AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1789.61605	1082.45363AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	576.28256	502.19648AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	712.71063	981.61104AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	389.34305	996.68216AFFX-SNP_10037362	NoCall	1551.93060	5526.68807AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	203.06941	547.19315AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	301.75946	918.01994AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1731.28171	248.11987AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	781.92483	2077.60590AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	956.70323	1224.65451AFFX-SNP_10047363	AA	1186.42722	259.77134AFFX-SNP_10047841	BB	692.66043	1122.69517AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1785.95832	2268.63576AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	275.31794	941.40210AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	534.40986	615.45926AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	926.80107	609.84822!sample_table_end
