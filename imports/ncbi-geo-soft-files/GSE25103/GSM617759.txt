DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617759/suppl/GSM617759_OR4058.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617759/suppl/GSM617759_OR4058.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1265.44949	245.12088AFFX-SNP_10009702	BB	604.10543	830.75061AFFX-SNP_10015773	BB	1399.01079	2159.88019AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	805.39070	494.64758AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	735.22386	2124.28682AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	402.42639	587.64024AFFX-SNP_10034687	NoCall	648.91886	1163.13633AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	298.83635	879.26715AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	948.03556	3862.07207AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	220.10691	1289.50994AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	338.94268	1317.50109AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1189.84187	172.20139AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	631.66777	2046.84074AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	956.93345	785.59433AFFX-SNP_10047363	NoCall	703.82049	373.35129AFFX-SNP_10047841	BB	633.31188	1146.92709AFFX-SNP_10049334	AA	2532.00267	916.06423AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	330.91480	1088.09104AFFX-SNP_10057887	AA	680.02147	463.90577AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	1123.07747	301.71266!sample_table_end
