DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617670/suppl/GSM617670_OR0997.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617670/suppl/GSM617670_OR0997.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	BB	238.34443	1927.46032AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1155.51601	275.80476AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1976.77634	1232.49221AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	602.77448	427.03053AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	563.02248	2017.35160AFFX-SNP_10029725	AA	732.82075	361.27225AFFX-SNP_10034687	NoCall	787.22140	561.59515AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	336.41862	784.09667AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	937.12354	3385.70431AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	220.59018	678.86955AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	697.05599	718.67286AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1296.92889	247.13915AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	736.98936	1869.89784AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	966.16621	1209.53786AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	510.70935	476.49116AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	739.75915	923.55388AFFX-SNP_10049334	AA	2834.06103	641.47924AFFX-SNP_10052664	AB	585.92660	624.91268AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	585.86109	639.79811AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	712.58096	1021.72252!sample_table_end
