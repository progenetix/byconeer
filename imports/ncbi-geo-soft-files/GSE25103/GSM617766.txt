DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617766/suppl/GSM617766_OR4145.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617766/suppl/GSM617766_OR4145.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	576.26388	1958.51436AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1427.60627	283.96303AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1718.30053	980.70739AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	679.70555	363.77521AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1325.76865	1212.31632AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	381.00395	548.86549AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1267.12554	405.71484AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	429.51792	563.41990AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	992.50761	3196.10984AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	236.84948	887.84290AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	282.30800	1295.55896AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1461.38234	156.70906AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	666.72964	2006.57032AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	243.31017	1653.99966AFFX-SNP_10047363	AA	717.12223	237.08145AFFX-SNP_10047841	BB	656.81197	1356.34141AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	369.80699	1865.52675AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	282.38077	1081.61234AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	443.92627	546.02601AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	687.04848	547.59702!sample_table_end
