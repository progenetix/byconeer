DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617705/suppl/GSM617705_OR2309.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617705/suppl/GSM617705_OR2309.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	631.91307	1612.85632AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	998.70440	289.91204AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1991.05430	1020.90949AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	815.41610	431.95084AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	653.05626	1947.80230AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	562.78095	505.23370AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	505.66127	411.02323AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	522.76379	580.23043AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	999.74155	3917.89253AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	193.52242	849.77500AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	331.75453	1384.33086AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1399.67041	215.25188AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	756.17540	1967.07881AFFX-SNP_10046830	AA	1592.40068	303.27504AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	507.37489	426.94615AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	717.25125	879.33761AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1492.07124	1341.51107AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	278.86059	1138.53766AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	502.21634	697.31915AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	1030.02926	191.84593!sample_table_end
