DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617776/suppl/GSM617776_ON68.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617776/suppl/GSM617776_ON68.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	645.58953	1396.59617AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	853.04775	562.57274AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1523.30829	1600.32006AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	735.40363	412.34077AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	643.40532	1707.69627AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	368.24656	614.16782AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1166.40278	416.04015AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	462.48882	548.52837AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	906.79797	3766.78376AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	209.53853	905.11420AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	875.36428	639.75597AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1544.93009	249.25467AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	650.67287	1866.75706AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	295.88270	1850.55790AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	611.00102	486.14864AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1283.16969	360.77430AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	467.75628	1859.00797AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	304.36468	1112.52931AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	313.79022	872.26026AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	616.03553	593.33299!sample_table_end
