DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617716/suppl/GSM617716_OR2449.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617716/suppl/GSM617716_OR2449.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	954.05535	1643.17045AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	1067.64435	623.32928AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1765.39132	934.58549AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	800.21602	369.74024AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1429.06617	1538.47362AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	551.51307	520.97849AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	884.02998	912.29049AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	370.16462	859.87382AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1005.30480	4090.22280AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	198.73031	773.51979AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	381.67745	1145.72756AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1653.57179	215.14433AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	789.95700	2166.11511AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	914.14840	965.47953AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	331.13412	782.78497AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	1007.42358	1090.98011AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	871.11812	2027.45899AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	352.09666	1103.45250AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	526.17892	700.82195AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	747.46106	880.92792!sample_table_end
