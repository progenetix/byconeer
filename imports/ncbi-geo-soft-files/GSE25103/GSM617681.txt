DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617681/suppl/GSM617681_OR1285.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617681/suppl/GSM617681_OR1285.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1102.89765	226.50515AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1224.88112	279.25712AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1692.94247	1651.16047AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	914.65460	377.69177AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1201.42345	1428.24446AFFX-SNP_10029725	AA	727.62937	371.64376AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	745.63227	816.82684AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	320.62682	838.29431AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	980.04613	4043.20657AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	226.00060	976.27380AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	786.26614	790.04189AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1513.72699	208.18918AFFX-SNP_10039933	AB	1314.14419	1227.83965AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	788.20769	1059.48172AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	524.08061	528.96467AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	809.31603	921.50417AFFX-SNP_10049334	AA	2619.48764	453.51313AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	279.91171	976.59596AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	264.26688	885.10410AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	1173.83429	295.46584!sample_table_end
