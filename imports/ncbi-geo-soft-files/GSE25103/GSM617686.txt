DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617686/suppl/GSM617686_OR1325.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617686/suppl/GSM617686_OR1325.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	729.93027	1557.09620AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1365.40317	284.47347AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1703.32959	1920.85339AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	701.84816	313.91161AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	633.52855	1710.24904AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	373.55579	804.06539AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1051.28972	358.16842AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	331.00870	722.40621AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1024.53085	3534.71723AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	206.38786	874.20577AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	1035.76627	1009.60890AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1639.22172	205.20225AFFX-SNP_10039933	AB	1316.37755	1103.34267AFFX-SNP_10046830	AA	1250.24069	255.62906AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	339.62046	828.91324AFFX-SNP_10047841	BB	559.70899	1313.24621AFFX-SNP_10049334	AA	2628.17512	464.88904AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	287.73667	914.91238AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	771.47011	602.80972AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	1081.09558	275.93216!sample_table_end
