DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617735/suppl/GSM617735_OR3233.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617735/suppl/GSM617735_OR3233.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	788.86485	1297.59729AFFX-SNP_10009702	BB	291.33275	903.13469AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1610.47160	1643.99083AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	695.05662	320.61169AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	502.99466	1803.15857AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	536.69828	422.71952AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	832.14665	818.99941AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	333.42211	730.59313AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1188.04683	3657.76746AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	245.39788	757.39200AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	283.32035	1189.48488AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1332.94832	181.17676AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	763.88645	1992.14519AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	849.40779	1071.92363AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	310.71265	779.00619AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1051.17561	330.45855AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	422.02010	2005.56304AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	289.93250	851.40144AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	252.70257	777.40401AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	681.58505	647.50068!sample_table_end
