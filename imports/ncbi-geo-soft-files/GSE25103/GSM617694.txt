DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617694/suppl/GSM617694_OR1458.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617694/suppl/GSM617694_OR1458.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	821.05033	1432.54476AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	833.38216	538.40282AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1752.15098	1816.58751AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	686.18308	427.80875AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1193.46210	1510.66302AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	394.59647	555.81255AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	1083.01102	900.26378AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	444.29048	860.54169AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	941.92493	3325.23490AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	196.58602	938.29811AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	273.28729	922.03609AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1457.34126	163.89983AFFX-SNP_10039933	AB	1454.89208	1361.15499AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	944.10804	1230.41334AFFX-SNP_10047363	AA	848.26927	283.93157AFFX-SNP_10047841	BB	546.38172	1185.60904AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1855.31868	1227.35409AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	283.28013	993.67491AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	513.72522	496.11870AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	1028.84728	332.05773!sample_table_end
