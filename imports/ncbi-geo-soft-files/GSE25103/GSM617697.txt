DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617697/suppl/GSM617697_OR2133.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617697/suppl/GSM617697_OR2133.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	BB	287.40653	2805.00193AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	1069.14903	546.78952AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1646.02859	1619.05236AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	677.69439	496.04530AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	776.32070	2030.84170AFFX-SNP_10029725	AA	802.33627	335.40112AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	885.56593	475.84689AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	530.65888	569.27157AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	968.86017	3807.16083AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	213.24901	960.90664AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	323.55105	1125.61404AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1540.88532	231.67320AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	756.90266	2012.09607AFFX-SNP_10046830	AA	1229.88597	327.49390AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	301.27220	648.78830AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1119.21720	398.48064AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1620.55663	1292.56612AFFX-SNP_10052664	AB	615.38711	813.16467AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	541.49254	621.72260AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	701.94760	763.95747!sample_table_end
