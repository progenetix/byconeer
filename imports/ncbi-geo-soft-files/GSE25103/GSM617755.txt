DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617755/suppl/GSM617755_OR4032.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617755/suppl/GSM617755_OR4032.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1002.55876	235.66912AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	1238.94466	484.54944AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1753.31700	946.08785AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	674.06138	386.26514AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	560.74438	1637.07932AFFX-SNP_10029725	AA	641.54491	296.89183AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	663.14936	976.98603AFFX-SNP_10036267	AA	531.26693	275.08797AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	906.81218	3634.36297AFFX-SNP_10037636	AB	500.72949	440.06102AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	300.13453	1159.18698AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1541.41651	184.12088AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	601.84020	1520.85577AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	271.47036	1746.71635AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	347.01327	787.73739AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1110.49135	317.51167AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	2219.25203	1364.58219AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	288.06826	1167.73378AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	307.52870	790.34580AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	912.64492	255.41025!sample_table_end
