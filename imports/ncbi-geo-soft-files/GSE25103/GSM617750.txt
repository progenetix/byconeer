DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617750/suppl/GSM617750_OR3383.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617750/suppl/GSM617750_OR3383.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	652.08954	1453.51409AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	781.68095	736.20185AFFX-SNP_10015773	BB	1172.44782	1785.02408AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	802.74507	442.81494AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	555.18536	1841.07132AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	505.47402	418.43946AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1034.18703	362.33792AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	279.64780	804.77421AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	813.87705	3393.24877AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	192.59256	1028.17324AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	874.11843	789.35267AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1373.80806	191.59226AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	629.53315	1855.57272AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	899.56175	1186.59190AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	505.81975	464.94335AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	853.45556	333.05836AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	440.75124	1659.72709AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	295.11047	966.94830AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	216.59542	780.17007AFFX-SNP_10064911	BB	352.84698	970.55160!sample_table_end
