DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617667/suppl/GSM617667_OR0948.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617667/suppl/GSM617667_OR0948.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	673.92837	1703.81162AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	783.04072	501.23323AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1688.75505	1467.72237AFFX-SNP_10021569	AB	531.44082	623.31631AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	633.33825	1945.88168AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	497.66211	479.79942AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1103.06466	453.54697AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	356.40754	861.72116AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	986.08649	3518.78193AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	222.96798	916.01634AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	329.87733	1185.69400AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1462.82145	224.04926AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	626.86136	1829.09362AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	291.14510	1812.13852AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	485.60868	471.82768AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1252.42039	420.03655AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	404.23131	1991.75300AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	274.68677	984.08840AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	507.76128	591.43606AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	808.90928	712.83326!sample_table_end
