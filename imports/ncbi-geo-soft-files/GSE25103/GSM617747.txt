DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617747/suppl/GSM617747_OR3306.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617747/suppl/GSM617747_OR3306.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	697.57233	1516.59597AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	828.84830	649.19620AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1960.35377	921.17700AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	650.03536	312.37667AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	598.15778	1988.52209AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	581.89065	430.11180AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1181.68222	412.22035AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	478.76451	564.86306AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	961.73532	3797.34231AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	227.97126	849.80509AFFX-SNP_10039349	AA	1247.79586	280.03338AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1546.61161	228.37819AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	694.62121	1915.98583AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	210.43378	1797.09826AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	542.64125	475.61180AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1373.20352	410.45962AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1678.46708	1357.17300AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	275.44820	1067.73801AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	308.31508	913.31850AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	784.18639	892.00314!sample_table_end
