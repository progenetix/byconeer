DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617715/suppl/GSM617715_OR2446.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617715/suppl/GSM617715_OR2446.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1204.73900	239.07942AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1272.55816	291.09810AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1659.00976	1518.80041AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	779.50302	426.79528AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1298.06555	1156.82523AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	381.67597	587.31340AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	580.31502	880.22365AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	457.05232	603.35172AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	878.81266	3205.13883AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	212.42786	952.71136AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	281.91229	1216.53955AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1509.20080	196.82738AFFX-SNP_10039933	AB	1360.06838	1274.24462AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	797.54706	1128.59048AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	741.68835	474.42233AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1198.29980	381.34147AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	425.05793	1909.59381AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	291.69664	947.39916AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	531.78575	561.25185AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	697.08267	727.58806!sample_table_end
