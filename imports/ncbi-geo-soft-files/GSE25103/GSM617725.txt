DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617725/suppl/GSM617725_OR3086.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617725/suppl/GSM617725_OR3086.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	798.16747	1631.81307AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1417.12065	289.94993AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1695.26951	1563.61876AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	737.61010	368.34291AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1403.60553	1313.42983AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	473.89823	398.43610AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	858.15028	372.42485AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	351.67883	846.54836AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	985.76956	3818.21550AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	243.64290	1114.63227AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	283.50244	1136.08036AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1573.26400	174.76543AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	637.16176	1973.22116AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	933.02890	1193.82403AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	284.45880	717.26419AFFX-SNP_10047841	BB	476.09189	1259.80574AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1915.12083	1402.30797AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	310.00669	1068.70142AFFX-SNP_10057887	AA	856.27747	363.35372AFFX-SNP_10064911	AB	690.82444	830.52421!sample_table_end
