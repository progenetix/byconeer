DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617676/suppl/GSM617676_OR1219.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617676/suppl/GSM617676_OR1219.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	715.41593	1647.92913AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	879.06959	640.95909AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1960.18210	1040.81659AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	794.17102	424.46674AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	707.15981	1820.04628AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	339.02775	600.16356AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1312.16903	545.65823AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	366.35395	703.58990AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	969.98846	3605.17402AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	234.81507	821.76646AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	261.60110	1192.49049AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1591.32721	205.69309AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	687.50811	2070.09597AFFX-SNP_10046830	BB	218.63115	1859.23814AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	533.97958	694.09984AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	854.27703	812.99326AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1772.57180	1753.36066AFFX-SNP_10052664	AB	569.44027	712.11504AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	315.92747	854.02587AFFX-SNP_10064911	BB	366.18344	1035.97278!sample_table_end
