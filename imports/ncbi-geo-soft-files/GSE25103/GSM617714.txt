DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617714/suppl/GSM617714_OR2442.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617714/suppl/GSM617714_OR2442.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1250.34164	248.55072AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	927.81275	558.09320AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	2028.81208	964.17208AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	727.21451	407.69218AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	730.89082	1989.89213AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	494.65274	450.13788AFFX-SNP_10034687	AB	762.49611	1026.16080AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	346.06951	773.16939AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1089.29659	3883.54193AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	192.18704	937.20500AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	847.06996	696.83503AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1419.59651	182.35419AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	761.85331	1904.97047AFFX-SNP_10046830	AA	1238.63788	292.79713AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	419.34508	901.78329AFFX-SNP_10047841	BB	733.46282	1271.27468AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1838.57796	1745.94439AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	326.43288	878.62158AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	486.96642	638.95562AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	878.51022	278.79714!sample_table_end
