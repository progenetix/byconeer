DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617753/suppl/GSM617753_OR4004.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617753/suppl/GSM617753_OR4004.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	BB	293.45403	2098.99775AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	862.14622	575.35439AFFX-SNP_10015773	AA	1840.72256	911.56223AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	752.96283	327.07743AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	624.87906	1866.18833AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	329.01795	521.63930AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	629.22055	341.83083AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	441.47928	500.51000AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	978.79250	3363.31420AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	220.95479	940.47665AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	265.36027	1001.17096AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1533.98739	212.55501AFFX-SNP_10039933	AB	1337.73117	1367.88319AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	972.35358	1025.88680AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	437.71310	377.08493AFFX-SNP_10047841	AB	828.99745	804.71936AFFX-SNP_10049334	AB	1913.49976	1265.23585AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	294.06265	1006.32517AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	242.20141	824.30590AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	737.32484	245.37186!sample_table_end
