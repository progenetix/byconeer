DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617733/suppl/GSM617733_OR3179.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617733/suppl/GSM617733_OR3179.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	647.68360	1717.55893AFFX-SNP_10009702	AA	1135.66883	248.34939AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1512.42003	1418.18495AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	698.50133	356.86646AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1283.92895	1340.66648AFFX-SNP_10029725	AB	592.18985	458.74380AFFX-SNP_10034687	NoCall	556.95593	1019.11492AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	406.54092	777.23988AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1004.81628	3494.29284AFFX-SNP_10037636	AB	451.11552	527.48039AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	773.03905	625.68812AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1515.90187	215.59476AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	731.54551	1782.16652AFFX-SNP_10046830	AA	1277.29235	324.46009AFFX-SNP_10047363	BB	291.44598	756.44847AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1150.93889	373.55685AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	492.26288	1848.77485AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	276.34053	948.19805AFFX-SNP_10057887	AB	525.68489	650.05661AFFX-SNP_10064911	BB	407.33917	1021.68363!sample_table_end
