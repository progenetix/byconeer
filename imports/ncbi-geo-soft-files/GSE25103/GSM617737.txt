DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617737/suppl/GSM617737_OR3243.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617737/suppl/GSM617737_OR3243.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AB	766.95460	1863.09654AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	1006.84481	495.62274AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1567.19145	1594.28269AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	639.26182	355.02083AFFX-SNP_10026879	BB	662.37222	1826.97471AFFX-SNP_10029725	AA	824.17029	379.94085AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	1022.95025	380.43854AFFX-SNP_10036267	AB	541.07530	575.74628AFFX-SNP_10037362	BB	1014.18255	3813.35677AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	207.48365	867.67070AFFX-SNP_10039349	AB	763.30746	743.50151AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1528.41789	157.06099AFFX-SNP_10039933	AB	1233.99972	1209.05597AFFX-SNP_10046830	AA	1283.71432	278.58851AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	571.20481	440.33260AFFX-SNP_10047841	BB	689.97869	1248.03217AFFX-SNP_10049334	AA	2845.57522	530.93532AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	289.89801	917.41332AFFX-SNP_10057887	BB	291.59056	808.17145AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	1038.32104	274.07778!sample_table_end
