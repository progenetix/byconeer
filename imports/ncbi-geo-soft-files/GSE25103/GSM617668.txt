DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = We used Partek to detect copy number variation. We used birdseed algorithm for calling SNP 6.0, which is suggested standard algorithm, and birdseed is embedded in software of Genotyping Console (GTC) or Affymetrix Power Tool (APT) which all provide by affymetrix company. The reported summarized intensity are separated into A intensity and B intensity, and results in calling into AA, AB, or BB categories.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chien-Hua,,Peng!Sample_contact_institute = Chang Gung Memorial Hospital !Sample_contact_address = No. 5, Fu-Hsing ST.!Sample_contact_city = Taoyuan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33305!Sample_contact_country = Taiwan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617668/suppl/GSM617668_OR0950.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM617nnn/GSM617668/suppl/GSM617668_OR0950.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25103!Sample_series_id = GSE25104!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#signalA = #signalB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	signalA	signalBAFFX-SNP_10000979	AA	1015.67522	192.65702AFFX-SNP_10009702	AB	821.00631	604.43787AFFX-SNP_10015773	AB	1686.47545	1536.50085AFFX-SNP_10021569	AA	838.81701	346.71399AFFX-SNP_10026879	AB	1380.81317	1215.43225AFFX-SNP_10029725	BB	441.74538	631.28818AFFX-SNP_10034687	AA	533.16805	392.11080AFFX-SNP_10036267	BB	356.34334	710.66388AFFX-SNP_10037362	AB	2508.28819	2416.94549AFFX-SNP_10037636	BB	196.04853	840.73457AFFX-SNP_10039349	BB	330.44177	1232.54587AFFX-SNP_10039442	AA	1306.67691	212.23551AFFX-SNP_10039933	BB	686.11258	1824.58104AFFX-SNP_10046830	AB	839.77944	1270.62514AFFX-SNP_10047363	AB	616.03833	520.13269AFFX-SNP_10047841	AA	1339.07106	396.04693AFFX-SNP_10049334	BB	474.75385	1899.99354AFFX-SNP_10052664	BB	276.47633	1106.67459AFFX-SNP_10057887	AA	728.36272	452.81834AFFX-SNP_10064911	AA	999.81548	272.58729!sample_table_end
