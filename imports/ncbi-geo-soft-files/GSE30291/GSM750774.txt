Quality was assessed by optical density 260/280 ratio using a spectrophotometer (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and by 0.8% agarose (SeaKem GTG, FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME) gel electrophoresis in 1x TAE (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Purified genomic DNA (1 ug) was fragmented and labeled by random priming with Cy3- or Cy5-labeled random 9mer oligos.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Male human reference!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Sex: M!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = sample description: Pool of six normal male samples!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Untreated!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Genomic DNA was purified from cells using either the QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit, or the Blood & Cell Culture DNA Maxi Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions.

In brief, the Cy3-labeled test sample and Cy5-labeled reference sample were combined and hybridized overnight at 42Â°C in NimbleGen Hybridization Buffer (NimbleGen Systems).  Arrays were washed with the NimbleGen Wash Buffer System (NimbleGen Systems) and immediately dried down by centrifugation.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned (at NimbleGen) at 5 um resolution using the GenePix4000B scanner (Axon Instruments). Data was extracted from scanned images using NimbleScan 2.0 software (NimbleGen Systems) and the extracted intensity for each spot was saved as raw data.!Sample_description = Prostate cancer cell line PR:DU-145(ATCC) compared to Male human reference!Sample_data_processing = Probes were mapped to human genome reference HG19 (NCBI 37) to provide chromosome and position annotations. After taking ratio of sample/reference, log to the base 2 was taken. Dye bias was calculated using the one sample (LC:A549) with dye flips and subtracted from all arrays. Probe bias was calculated as described in article and subtracted from all probes. R (64-bit ver. 2.13.0) was used to do log2 transformation of the ratio (sample/reference). The log ratio was corrected for dye and probe bias (as described in article).!Sample_platform_id = GPL13786!Sample_contact_name = Sudhir,,Varma!Sample_contact_email = sudhirv4rma@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = HiThru Analytics!Sample_contact_address = 1215 Wessex Pl!Sample_contact_city = Princeton!Sample_contact_state = NJ!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 08540!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM750nnn/GSM750774/suppl/GSM750774_38074_532.pair.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM750nnn/GSM750774/suppl/GSM750774_38074_635.pair.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30291!Sample_data_row_count = 386098#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 ratio (sample/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUECHR1800P049297946	-0.335270464375219CHRX00P096150096	-0.15247885633616CHR0100P159595778	0.127098906640931CHR0400P069309209	-0.338800808938435CHR0100P071634187	-0.181890925343039CHR0300P074980284	-0.266416518465172CHR0900P082756107	-0.46792690079624CHR0100P055752519	-0.365728013192006CHR0600P037378125	-0.000773476104378723CHR0600P091234682	-0.615234111628454CHR0300P046581067	-0.444341752763002CHR1300P100916253	-0.403580431590907CHR0300P189396472	-0.28796423261007CHR1700P050953693	-0.0578034500675964CHR1800P035188932	-0.10981856228641CHR0900P099620062	-0.0953278248848894CHR0500P057345736	-0.0943588867185072CHR0500P145785198	-1.68437837435295CHR0800P049969732	-0.0885042951319512CHR0300P152516000	-0.0136042517696282!sample_table_end
