Quality was assessed by optical density 260/280 ratio using a spectrophotometer (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and by 0.8% agarose (SeaKem GTG, FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME) gel electrophoresis in 1x TAE (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Purified genomic DNA (1 ug) was fragmented and labeled by random priming with Cy3- or Cy5-labeled random 9mer oligos.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Male human reference!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Sex: M!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = sample description: Pool of six normal male samples!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Untreated!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Genomic DNA was purified from cells using either the QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit, or the Blood & Cell Culture DNA Maxi Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions.

In brief, the Cy3-labeled test sample and Cy5-labeled reference sample were combined and hybridized overnight at 42Â°C in NimbleGen Hybridization Buffer (NimbleGen Systems).  Arrays were washed with the NimbleGen Wash Buffer System (NimbleGen Systems) and immediately dried down by centrifugation.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned (at NimbleGen) at 5 um resolution using the GenePix4000B scanner (Axon Instruments). Data was extracted from scanned images using NimbleScan 2.0 software (NimbleGen Systems) and the extracted intensity for each spot was saved as raw data.!Sample_description = Breast cancer cell line BR:MCF7 compared to Male human reference!Sample_data_processing = Probes were mapped to human genome reference HG19 (NCBI 37) to provide chromosome and position annotations. After taking ratio of sample/reference, log to the base 2 was taken. Dye bias was calculated using the one sample (LC:A549) with dye flips and subtracted from all arrays. Probe bias was calculated as described in article and subtracted from all probes. R (64-bit ver. 2.13.0) was used to do log2 transformation of the ratio (sample/reference). The log ratio was corrected for dye and probe bias (as described in article).!Sample_platform_id = GPL13786!Sample_contact_name = Sudhir,,Varma!Sample_contact_email = sudhirv4rma@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = HiThru Analytics!Sample_contact_address = 1215 Wessex Pl!Sample_contact_city = Princeton!Sample_contact_state = NJ!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 08540!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM750nnn/GSM750778/suppl/GSM750778_42606_532.pair.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM750nnn/GSM750778/suppl/GSM750778_42606_635.pair.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30291!Sample_data_row_count = 386098#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 ratio (sample/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUECHR1800P049297946	0.4920689445664CHRX00P096150096	1.04548810275473CHR0100P159595778	-0.246317829400832CHR0400P069309209	0.495421658202577CHR0100P071634187	-0.178051677103859CHR0300P074980284	0.299512609476742CHR0900P082756107	0.356869093578808CHR0100P055752519	0.248457546307889CHR0600P037378125	0.307616264413544CHR0600P091234682	0.546078917907008CHR0300P046581067	0.511870440226531CHR1300P100916253	-0.149018163492327CHR0300P189396472	0.352213646220833CHR1700P050953693	1.13744478785556CHR1800P035188932	-0.161307675619319CHR0900P099620062	0.342156822949044CHR0500P057345736	0.802780969375671CHR0500P145785198	0.395096718150085CHR0800P049969732	0.535540403392149CHR0300P152516000	0.284901312949748!sample_table_end
