Quality was assessed by optical density 260/280 ratio using a spectrophotometer (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and by 0.8% agarose (SeaKem GTG, FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME) gel electrophoresis in 1x TAE (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Purified genomic DNA (1 ug) was fragmented and labeled by random priming with Cy3- or Cy5-labeled random 9mer oligos.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Male human reference!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Sex: M!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = sample description: Pool of six normal male samples!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Untreated!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Genomic DNA was purified from cells using either the QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit, or the Blood & Cell Culture DNA Maxi Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions.

In brief, the Cy3-labeled test sample and Cy5-labeled reference sample were combined and hybridized overnight at 42Â°C in NimbleGen Hybridization Buffer (NimbleGen Systems).  Arrays were washed with the NimbleGen Wash Buffer System (NimbleGen Systems) and immediately dried down by centrifugation.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned (at NimbleGen) at 5 um resolution using the GenePix4000B scanner (Axon Instruments). Data was extracted from scanned images using NimbleScan 2.0 software (NimbleGen Systems) and the extracted intensity for each spot was saved as raw data.!Sample_description = Melanoma cancer cell line ME:LOXIMVI compared to Male human reference!Sample_data_processing = Probes were mapped to human genome reference HG19 (NCBI 37) to provide chromosome and position annotations. After taking ratio of sample/reference, log to the base 2 was taken. Dye bias was calculated using the one sample (LC:A549) with dye flips and subtracted from all arrays. Probe bias was calculated as described in article and subtracted from all probes. R (64-bit ver. 2.13.0) was used to do log2 transformation of the ratio (sample/reference). The log ratio was corrected for dye and probe bias (as described in article).!Sample_platform_id = GPL13786!Sample_contact_name = Sudhir,,Varma!Sample_contact_email = sudhirv4rma@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = HiThru Analytics!Sample_contact_address = 1215 Wessex Pl!Sample_contact_city = Princeton!Sample_contact_state = NJ!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 08540!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM750nnn/GSM750808/suppl/GSM750808_59327_532.pair.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM750nnn/GSM750808/suppl/GSM750808_59327_635.pair.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30291!Sample_data_row_count = 386098#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 ratio (sample/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUECHR1800P049297946	0.4167369334642CHRX00P096150096	0.42537116517855CHR0100P159595778	-0.165594583632386CHR0400P069309209	0.146194913227575CHR0100P071634187	-0.0860392007155379CHR0300P074980284	0.0545540352016785CHR0900P082756107	0.52189734464247CHR0100P055752519	0.132320245848573CHR0600P037378125	0.338427368513273CHR0600P091234682	-0.276051864413092CHR0300P046581067	0.497700238918455CHR1300P100916253	0.0220315291248578CHR0300P189396472	-0.06296464345776CHR1700P050953693	0.137161391365781CHR1800P035188932	-0.323058497994609CHR0900P099620062	-0.0824732849794865CHR0500P057345736	-0.0720283597709868CHR0500P145785198	0.0947288446887447CHR0800P049969732	0.0053010319583251CHR0300P152516000	-0.313776046748568!sample_table_end
