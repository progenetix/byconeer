Quality was assessed by optical density 260/280 ratio using a spectrophotometer (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and by 0.8% agarose (SeaKem GTG, FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME) gel electrophoresis in 1x TAE (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Purified genomic DNA (1 ug) was fragmented and labeled by random priming with Cy3- or Cy5-labeled random 9mer oligos.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Male human reference!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Sex: M!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = sample description: Pool of six normal male samples!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Untreated!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Genomic DNA was purified from cells using either the QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit, or the Blood & Cell Culture DNA Maxi Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions.

In brief, the Cy3-labeled test sample and Cy5-labeled reference sample were combined and hybridized overnight at 42Â°C in NimbleGen Hybridization Buffer (NimbleGen Systems).  Arrays were washed with the NimbleGen Wash Buffer System (NimbleGen Systems) and immediately dried down by centrifugation.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned (at NimbleGen) at 5 um resolution using the GenePix4000B scanner (Axon Instruments). Data was extracted from scanned images using NimbleScan 2.0 software (NimbleGen Systems) and the extracted intensity for each spot was saved as raw data.!Sample_description = Non-Small Cell Lung cancer cell line LC:NCI-H23 compared to Male human reference!Sample_data_processing = Probes were mapped to human genome reference HG19 (NCBI 37) to provide chromosome and position annotations. After taking ratio of sample/reference, log to the base 2 was taken. Dye bias was calculated using the one sample (LC:A549) with dye flips and subtracted from all arrays. Probe bias was calculated as described in article and subtracted from all probes. R (64-bit ver. 2.13.0) was used to do log2 transformation of the ratio (sample/reference). The log ratio was corrected for dye and probe bias (as described in article).!Sample_platform_id = GPL13786!Sample_contact_name = Sudhir,,Varma!Sample_contact_email = sudhirv4rma@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = HiThru Analytics!Sample_contact_address = 1215 Wessex Pl!Sample_contact_city = Princeton!Sample_contact_state = NJ!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 08540!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM750nnn/GSM750803/suppl/GSM750803_59209_532.pair.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM750nnn/GSM750803/suppl/GSM750803_59209_635.pair.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30291!Sample_data_row_count = 386098#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 ratio (sample/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUECHR1800P049297946	0.00324988926739778CHRX00P096150096	0.283218450293433CHR0100P159595778	0.308377412399159CHR0400P069309209	-0.155103894468754CHR0100P071634187	0.0735163814209798CHR0300P074980284	-0.274625348414244CHR0900P082756107	-0.308781084670168CHR0100P055752519	0.0897667292236681CHR0600P037378125	0.367926888126791CHR0600P091234682	-0.176829056407395CHR0300P046581067	-0.300425979103425CHR1300P100916253	-0.0660130338813101CHR0300P189396472	0.83956966643066CHR1700P050953693	0.0797398403300251CHR1800P035188932	-0.187204709482359CHR0900P099620062	0.123398817345133CHR0500P057345736	0.451223581485849CHR0500P145785198	-0.136511591181574CHR0800P049969732	1.08020305776395CHR0300P152516000	0.289217603619216!sample_table_end
