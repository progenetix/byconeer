Samples were then incubated over night at 37ÂºC. The labelling reaction was terminated by the addition of 90mM EDTA, unincorporated nucleotides were removed by the addition of 32Âµg of COT-1 DNA and 80mM NaOH and heated to 70ÂºC for 10 minutes. Samples were clean up and volume reduced by first adding 0.5 x SSPE (5mM Phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.5mM EDTA) to a total volume of 500Âµl, this was then filtered through a 0.1Âµm Ultrafree-MC filter column (Millipore) and centrifuged 6500rpm. The volume was then reduced to 3Âµl/2Âµg of labelled sample by filtering through a Microcon YM-30 filtration unit (Millipore) at 13K rpm.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Genomic Male DNA(Genomic Male blood DNA)!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: male!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue type: normal!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Tumour samples were ground in a pestle and mortar.

Slides were then transferred a 42ÂºC wash containing 6 x SSPE and 50% formamide for 5 â 15 seconds, and finally washed for 30 seconds each in 2 x SSPE and 10mM EDTA, and 0.1 x SSPE. Finally slides were rinsed in HPLC grade water and excess solution removed with canned air.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridised microarray slides were scanned with a GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments), and images visualised by GenePix software (version 3). Slides were scanned with laser power levels at 100% PMT (Photomultiplyer Tube) voltage levels were altered in order to provide an average Cy5:Cy3 hybridisation ratio across the slide of 1:1.  Individual fluoresce intensities rations (Cy5:Cy3) for each cDNA were determined by the software, with the hybridisation signal for each clone being calculated as the median fluorescence of pixels within a defined area of array spot.  Spots from cDNA clones representing mitochondrial sequences and spots, which didnât respond, were removed at this point of data analysis.  Data was normalised using Lowess Normalisation.!Sample_description = Slides were hybridised at 65C for 1 hour then 47C for 3 nights.!Sample_data_processing = Data were filtered for quality by automated spot flagging and manual inspection in GenePix software and the normalised using a lowess algorithm. Each clone was normalized according to its position on the array to adjust for regional variations in relative signal intensity on the slides. The data set was renormalized to a Log2 ratio of 0.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3898!Sample_contact_name = Ian,,Giddings!Sample_contact_email = ian.giddings@icr.ac.uk, daniel.brewer@icr.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = +44 20 8722 4293!Sample_contact_fax = +44 20 8722 4141!Sample_contact_laboratory = CANCER RESEARCH UK DNA Microarray Facility!Sample_contact_department = Section of Molecular Carcinogenesis!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Cancer Research!Sample_contact_address = 15 Cotswold Road!Sample_contact_city = Sutton!Sample_contact_state = Surrey!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SM2 5NG!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.crukdmf.icr.ac.uk!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE6145!Sample_data_row_count = 5603
