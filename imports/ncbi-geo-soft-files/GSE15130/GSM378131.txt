Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378131/suppl/GSM378131.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15130!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	5.305307151e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	-1.024966394e-0015	1.190963315e-0016	-2.732071727e-0027	1.001981068e-0018	2.197056600e-0019	1.755766564e-00110	3.938893205e-00211	-1.418527159e-00112	-3.393550645e-00213	-4.343247383e-00214	-5.623366971e-00215	4.890610484e-00216	-1.162183375e-00117	-9.396486891e-00218	-9.184811486e-00219	4.966784853e-00220	6.196508228e-002!sample_table_end
