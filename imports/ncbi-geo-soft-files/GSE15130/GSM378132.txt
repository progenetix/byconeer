Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378132/suppl/GSM378132.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15130!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	3.321609454e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	-1.282606808e-0025	2.433067536e-0016	-2.222684152e-0017	6.195865994e-0028	-7.897756222e-0029	3.196280382e-00110	8.484565908e-00311	-1.062122022e-00112	1.018788949e-00113	-1.918559596e-00114	-2.623725720e-00115	1.069132060e-00116	-2.096045076e-00117	4.087130387e-00318	0.000000000e+00019	6.131994423e-00220	4.317501151e-002!sample_table_end
