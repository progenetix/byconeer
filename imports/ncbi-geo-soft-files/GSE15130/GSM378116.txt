Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378116/suppl/GSM378116.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15130!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	3.362306728e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	9.735262131e-0035	-2.974133581e-0026	1.714018117e-0017	4.613369933e-0028	1.806089008e-0029	3.207614017e-00210	-1.663354451e-00211	-6.432063966e-00212	1.569619256e-00113	-2.176081269e-00214	1.076811967e-00115	-3.059989667e-00216	1.259169432e-00217	3.560294103e-00218	-6.708246842e-00219	-6.839794768e-00220	-4.022518285e-002!sample_table_end
