Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378124/suppl/GSM378124.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15130!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	1.243873794e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	-9.636244092e-0025	-5.862461523e-0026	6.395398855e-0027	1.130480985e-0018	-1.799358086e-0019	1.761198549e-00110	6.563035855e-00211	-1.476123585e-00212	1.525157814e-00113	-3.025001741e-00214	-5.256272598e-00215	-1.841458347e-00216	-4.080709952e-00317	-1.788266822e-00118	2.377919519e-00119	-1.254282947e-00220	1.845175432e-002!sample_table_end
