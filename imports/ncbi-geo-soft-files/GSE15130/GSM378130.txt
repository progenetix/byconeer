Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378130/suppl/GSM378130.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15130!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	-7.927641212e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	2.175431877e-0014	9.691612649e-0025	-1.980278479e-0016	-6.339653691e-0027	1.595248737e-0018	9.998068133e-0029	1.763298802e-00110	-2.325578071e-00111	1.682270463e-00212	1.337976168e-00113	-1.222173331e-00214	-4.230002150e-00215	1.705788525e-00116	-1.944194770e-00117	-3.812568193e-00218	0.000000000e+00019	-1.838754883e-00120	8.307420722e-002!sample_table_end
