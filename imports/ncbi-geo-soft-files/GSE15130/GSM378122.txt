Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378122/suppl/GSM378122.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15130!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	2.537016171e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	-8.267867011e-0025	-1.537382624e-0046	-3.604778789e-0027	-3.009765530e-0028	2.893848264e-0029	2.504099825e-00110	-4.227585175e-00211	-1.080770849e-00112	6.448253319e-00213	-4.001613440e-00214	1.523707825e-00215	-1.674558604e-00216	-2.220632083e-00217	-1.181442665e-00118	-1.315690354e-00119	-1.796295285e-00320	-6.834256872e-002!sample_table_end
