Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378105/suppl/GSM378105.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15130!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	9.462072960e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	9.013967085e-0035	1.479128640e-0016	-1.974597174e-0017	6.581566210e-0028	-8.248613545e-0029	1.167591385e-00110	9.564540624e-00211	-9.142394393e-00212	-2.475449431e-00213	2.654841066e-00414	-1.419270391e-00115	-3.653387085e-00216	2.424424623e-00217	-1.280437833e-00118	6.062193621e-00219	3.369806848e-00220	-1.062581135e-001!sample_table_end
