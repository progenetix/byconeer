Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378128/suppl/GSM378128.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15130!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	-4.393876244e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	-9.496717909e-0025	-7.990832184e-0026	2.368512913e-0027	1.072918223e-0018	-9.879358569e-0029	3.746168427e-00110	-1.036319261e-00111	4.460557572e-00212	3.537548132e-00213	3.077067334e-00214	-7.525630889e-00215	9.711805350e-00216	-4.497741202e-00217	-2.185012940e-00118	1.779866776e-00119	-8.677927139e-00220	1.183978650e-001!sample_table_end
