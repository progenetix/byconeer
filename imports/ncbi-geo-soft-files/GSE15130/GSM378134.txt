Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378134/suppl/GSM378134.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15130!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	1.895936129e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	4.394650394e-0024	2.065083946e-0015	1.616039710e-0016	-1.222758893e-0017	2.081311626e-0018	-8.341055694e-0029	1.629566105e-00110	-7.063559915e-00211	-1.037792141e-00112	2.839270242e-00113	3.886281047e-00214	2.555387986e-00115	2.977363520e-00116	-1.078184497e-00117	1.071030570e-00118	-1.126347720e-00219	-1.793790773e-00120	-4.210537017e-002!sample_table_end
