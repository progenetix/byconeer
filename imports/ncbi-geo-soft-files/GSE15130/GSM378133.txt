Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378133/suppl/GSM378133.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15130!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	0.000000000e+0002	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	0.000000000e+0005	0.000000000e+0006	0.000000000e+0007	0.000000000e+0008	0.000000000e+0009	0.000000000e+00010	-6.564617167e-00211	-1.154828453e-00112	-7.067525389e-00213	0.000000000e+00014	-5.569371378e-00215	0.000000000e+00016	0.000000000e+00017	0.000000000e+00018	0.000000000e+00019	0.000000000e+00020	0.000000000e+000!sample_table_end
