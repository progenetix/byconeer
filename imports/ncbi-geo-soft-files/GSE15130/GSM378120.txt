Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378120/suppl/GSM378120.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15130!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	8.266501306e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	-1.699424611e-0014	-1.054416046e-0015	5.674526850e-0026	-5.703812114e-0037	-1.200416317e-0018	-1.689040295e-0019	9.612598891e-00210	1.118983445e-00111	-4.851770298e-00212	2.180120271e-00213	-3.401589266e-00414	-1.138036048e-00115	-8.498792839e-00216	1.052998182e-00117	-1.567185667e-00118	-2.252314449e-00119	3.232308071e-00220	-6.877756025e-002!sample_table_end
