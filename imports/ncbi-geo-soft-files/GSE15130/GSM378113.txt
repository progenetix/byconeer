Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378113/suppl/GSM378113.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15130!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	2.005089110e-0022	2.123778360e-0013	0.000000000e+0004	4.385896817e-0025	-6.384492926e-0026	9.781022353e-0037	-2.201378749e-0038	3.241659832e-0029	1.764793490e-00110	-2.171875585e-00111	-3.116142586e-00212	2.768191023e-00113	-2.720554575e-00214	1.876984769e-00215	1.845715648e-00216	2.893940769e-00217	-1.168216079e-00218	0.000000000e+00019	-1.291271249e-00120	-1.984633996e-001!sample_table_end
