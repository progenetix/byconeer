Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378114/suppl/GSM378114.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15130!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	3.684512564e-0022	-5.640590907e-0023	0.000000000e+0004	-1.084787491e-0015	8.944070004e-0026	-3.057130692e-0027	5.786161121e-0028	2.091904956e-0029	1.518928146e-00110	8.611492030e-00211	-1.214290440e-00112	-6.297348419e-00213	-9.047617716e-00214	-1.431559096e-00115	4.337579403e-00216	2.161704951e-00117	-8.795493725e-00218	-6.647765820e-00219	2.233332183e-00220	-3.239887295e-003!sample_table_end
