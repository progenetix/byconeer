Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378121/suppl/GSM378121.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15130!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	1.359924554e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	2.180977113e-0025	-6.377565914e-0026	-1.191962431e-0027	-6.021423321e-0028	-5.307416060e-0039	7.745019693e-00210	4.563010122e-00211	-4.607588021e-00212	-4.778121333e-00213	-2.632803294e-00214	-2.353730121e-00215	-5.588233153e-00216	-1.147549627e-00217	2.270983005e-00218	-1.590701853e-00119	-6.358945170e-00220	-1.005491525e-001!sample_table_end
