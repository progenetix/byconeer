Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378126/suppl/GSM378126.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15130!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	-6.050871105e-0022	-7.355636254e-0023	0.000000000e+0004	-5.190470494e-0025	-3.509622459e-0016	9.773229456e-0027	7.262695419e-0028	5.571871361e-0029	4.161448903e-00210	1.328908271e-00111	-2.537584641e-00212	-9.033822653e-00213	-8.198448182e-00214	-2.204327569e-00215	3.577521270e-00116	-3.419785988e-00217	-2.000257387e-00218	-2.234074267e-00119	-7.967224122e-00220	3.838725218e-003!sample_table_end
