Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378135/suppl/GSM378135.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15130!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	7.501443981e-0032	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	-7.511605915e-0035	4.768782842e-0026	-4.097679714e-0017	2.692418070e-0018	1.607690539e-0019	2.340857461e-00110	3.443082278e-00111	-4.026101351e-00212	1.020938529e-00113	-1.226180285e-00114	2.416440831e-00115	1.267586159e-00116	-3.588398467e-00117	-7.605911773e-00218	0.000000000e+00019	1.786329204e-00120	1.218037732e-001!sample_table_end
