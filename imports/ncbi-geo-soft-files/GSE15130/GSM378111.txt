Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378111/suppl/GSM378111.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15130!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	-1.952908410e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	-9.131529894e-0025	-9.281861191e-0026	-8.687436951e-0027	4.931010319e-0028	3.543659493e-0029	-4.485892112e-00210	-1.089769290e-00211	-1.315486651e-00112	1.442463943e-00113	-5.405572621e-00214	-9.003455771e-00215	6.247343885e-00216	-4.501946551e-00217	-1.453487585e-00218	9.774147264e-00219	-1.052479695e-00220	-8.840119290e-002!sample_table_end
