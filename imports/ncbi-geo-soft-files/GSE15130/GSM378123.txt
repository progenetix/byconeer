Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378123/suppl/GSM378123.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15130!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	1.273880900e-0012	-2.367157870e-0013	0.000000000e+0004	-4.856011349e-0025	-1.226193567e-0026	-9.626887460e-0037	-7.127828438e-0028	-3.469171173e-0029	8.904442317e-00310	3.075214748e-00111	-5.600650997e-00212	-1.599979812e-00213	-1.963308954e-00114	-8.602398870e-00215	2.610457861e-00216	1.390861707e-00117	-6.817715234e-00218	0.000000000e+00019	-6.245138005e-00220	-1.307807812e-001!sample_table_end
