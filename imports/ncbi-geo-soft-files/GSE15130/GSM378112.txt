Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378112/suppl/GSM378112.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15130!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	5.034084330e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	2.987126768e-0025	1.038541675e-0046	2.465990542e-0027	1.320147818e-0028	-2.471383930e-0029	3.033299089e-00210	8.866066601e-00211	2.025907585e-00112	1.436307486e-00113	-1.527671390e-00214	8.692753692e-00215	3.971654010e-00216	3.872797174e-00217	-1.392703592e-00218	0.000000000e+00019	-8.442921515e-00220	-2.975085948e-002!sample_table_end
