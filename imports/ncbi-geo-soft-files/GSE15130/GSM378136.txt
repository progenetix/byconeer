Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378136/suppl/GSM378136.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15130!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	6.985630296e-0032	0.000000000e+0003	7.736349538e-0024	-1.009791922e-0015	-9.435166034e-0036	2.283484347e-0027	1.080222205e-0018	6.571750573e-0029	3.542018849e-00210	-5.952987252e-00211	-2.444799383e-00212	-3.658937166e-00213	3.406820020e-00214	1.414957996e-00115	2.090900373e-00216	-1.809280142e-00217	-7.486213714e-00218	2.518904653e-00219	-6.315054098e-00220	4.089034687e-002!sample_table_end
