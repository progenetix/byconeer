Approximately 10,000 cells were captured for each sample. Serial sections were used if cells could not be obtained from a single section. Genomic DNA was isolated from the cells using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and DNA concentration was determined using Quant-iT DNA Assay Kit, High Sensitivity (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = For each sample, 100 ng of normal genomic DNA was converted into a WGA library in a volume of 15 ul and amplified by PCR following the manufacturerâs WGA amplification protocol. Hundred ng aliquots of the products were then subjected to a second WGA PCR amplification in the presence of amino-allyl dUTP and purified. Yields after all WGA PCR amplifications were between 10 to 20 Î¼g per reaction and used for the hybridizations. For all WGA amplified genomic DNA samples with aminoallyl dUTP incorporated (4 Î¼g), nuclease free water was added to 500 Î¼l, the sample was transferred to a Microcon YM-30 filter, and centrifuged at 12,000 rcf at RT for 12 minutes. The spin column was inverted in a new collection tube and centrifuged at 12,000 rcf for 2 min at RT. The amount of sample was measured and the volume was adjusted to 5 Î¼l with nuclease free water. For labeling, 5 Î¼l of 1 M sodium bicarbonate (pH 9.0) was added and allowed to incubate at RT for 10 min. Two Î¼l of anhydrous DMSO were added to Alexa Fluor 647 (Cy5) and 555 (Cy3) dye packs (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), mixed thoroughly, and 2 Î¼l of the appropriate dye was added to each sample. The labeling mixture was incubated in the dark at RT for 1 hour. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 9 Î¼l of 4 M Hydroxylamine and incubated in room temperature for 15 min. The Cy3 labeled and Cy5 labeled genomic DNA for each hybridization were mixed, and RNase free water was added to 100 Î¼l, and purified using Qiaquick (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) spin columns.  The final eluted volume was 60 Î¼l.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Human Genomic DNA : Male!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Promega Normal Genomic DNA!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Microdissection (LCM) was performed from frozen tissue sections with the SL Microtest device using Î¼CUT software (MMI).

The spin column was inverted in a new collection tube and centrifuged at 12,000 rcf for 2 min at RT. The eluted probe volume was adjusted to 18 Î¼l with nuclease free water and the following were added: 2 Î¼l of yeast tRNA (10 Î¼g/Î¼l, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 4 Î¼l of Poly dA-Poly dT (10 Î¼g/Î¼l, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO),  5.1 Î¼l of 20X SSC and 0.9 Î¼l of 10% SDS. The probe was denatured at 100Â° C for 3 min and centrifuged at 12,000 rcf for 10 sec. The probe was added directly to the microarray and a cover slip was placed carefully. Slides were hybridized overnight in DIE-TECH 1 or 5 slide hybridization chambers in a 65Â° C water bath. After hybridization, cover slips were removed by placing slides in 2x SSC / 0.03% SDS. Slides were then washed sequentially in the following order: 2x SSC / 0.03% SDS for 5 min, 1x SSC / 0.03% SDS for 5 min, and 0.2x SSC / 0.03% SDS for five minutes. Slides were given a final wash in 0.2x SSC for two minutes, and centrifuged dry at 500 rpm for 5 min.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA).!Sample_description = N_2005-02-23_NM_Num78_0001.gpr!Sample_data_processing = Images were gridded and spots were quantified using GenePix Pro 6.0 software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA).!Sample_platform_id = GPL2013!Sample_contact_name = Jung,,Kim!Sample_contact_email = junghk@med.umich.edu!Sample_contact_institute = University of Michigan!Sample_contact_address = 1400 E.
