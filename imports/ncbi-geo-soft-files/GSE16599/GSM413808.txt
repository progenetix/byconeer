Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413808/suppl/GSM413808_NN526.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413808/suppl/GSM413808_NN527.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16599!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2192.2279978287038	2464.5939094305495	2338.0852129513341	2299.445582387641	1.1030436193052615	1.1477168440645227	0.96107644059570008	-0.1040	0.930460600776879422	3320.0507431485835	4305.1355831931005	3507.2612530729039	3953.0672142254411	1.585355629311924	1.8551243906313573	0.85458184762067491	-0.1407	0.907062903406585573	1635.175162927922	1636.2297942930093	1753.1179008193214	1554.2943641840311	0.84516147167009625	0.77059087860744013	1.0967706666829682	0.1102	1.07934816181578594	8711.5769781888248	9463.3485649248851	8778.9616009442689	8558.8908350130569	4.571841407633241	4.0674033022811154	1.1240196921385255	-0.1955	0.87327545520430865	16586.126400681034	14882.55931497516	16856.67874708946	13360.427593599312	8.0560464414495829	6.6284406550782453	1.2153758116967686	0.1978	1.14691396675746826	5590.2842890287839	5347.9006519882723	5755.7777835769612	4888.7274762712159	2.7026479795140848	2.3563434646126988	1.1469669087304752	0.1222	1.08835740310989997	1390.0770959221668	1513.7258316326049	1493.9304853308436	1445.0894052191779	0.56545954814151356	0.62600771666492505	0.90327887834037623	0.1990	1.14790933023642588	1501.3927132053329	2027.2268532799173	1611.471592817592	1901.7362541327166	0.79327622537226272	0.94231580727273268	0.84183690780713638	-0.0851	0.942742660675408359	3588.6003439053375	3830.9854455222876	3778.6363992420906	3524.1519857947505	1.744593634161691	1.6074601548385579	1.0853106553903389	0.0599	1.042373692195696110	5835.5094063785764	7611.8223954137266	5992.8581245712057	6906.1313663258397	2.8738890685234182	3.2816864050183963	0.87573543411357968	-0.1124	0.9250266644840395811	6538.6352754848886	9486.8603506659565	6678.4716116275231	8579.2413931615029	3.3936435450918156	4.0436367434515308	0.83925529428123158	-0.3284	0.7964003518437888812	4568.7649467873407	4977.2843449392485	4756.8192967215682	4557.1318691727502	2.5075977734731634	2.2399354066042156	1.1194955738811811	0.1267	1.091773679042499213	1625.3165888330705	2386.0981300707058	1742.6991682036041	2227.859417886039	0.88423169233204624	1.1896592889328319	0.74326464775073087	-0.1394	0.9078967008713050314	7926.1526199918644	8777.767032913418	8017.3841758551289	7945.0735841589985	3.5290388677459816	3.5367207777470235	0.99782795688894188	0.0520	1.036687126292440615	1670.2813007646748	1839.7729609711157	1789.8739364311712	1738.2095471649329	0.87386154091992174	0.90626719717358339	0.96424271301584485	0.1244	1.09008902267154116	1377.2862034668021	2045.7742857676544	1481.0286623740189	1922.4514073225196	0.59955025362291225	0.81507337317812689	0.73557826001007898	-0.2287	0.8534023999486131117	438.86395615056227	386.41179137236816	456.55920316633876	410.13071087763393	0.23068143239171721	0.2196454226551392	1.0502446607043818	0.0521	1.036754542866807218	2780.3392472137962	4088.6504617248665	2950.7386989000956	3758.4751469097305	1.4951170731109416	1.8203142594803787	0.82135107458738077	-0.1497	0.9014532195827601519	1618.9257190696435	1937.9238180230877	1735.7721801904033	1822.8022831973551	0.74161199137014511	0.79682160960528481	0.93071269959346559	-0.0157	0.989197257284608520	1397.4851422593076	2003.3134957811162	1501.7532135003382	1884.6901094583195	0.7133308750712688	0.94002016102933816	0.75884635739105777	-0.4707	0.72163459650395145!sample_table_end
