Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413109/suppl/GSM413109_NN528.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413109/suppl/GSM413109_NN529.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16599!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1392.837547001418	2308.5898915058237	1673.4359451915016	1880.9749955445668	1.0043395150234851	1.2447747340379429	0.8068443932545879	-0.3091	0.807155306456065152	1401.8981983658005	2914.4469123998124	1691.5370343201259	2342.7537140778204	1.0934024130333531	1.5720032094886351	0.69554718872936105	-0.6362	0.643405716898564963	1035.4854780675912	1154.3139132700453	1258.7180891418764	1002.445321575048	0.84063631744822975	0.71084354783630987	1.1825897836549091	0.0986	1.07073887140382574	5748.2893415920089	9029.6920799817708	6181.2111149670618	7003.4182699020485	3.927679593450045	4.187946267590239	0.93785338743375213	-0.5429	0.686368047098829155	6095.1912181811394	12685.577818059779	6502.7374521928996	9756.8904459600799	4.8857033059017203	7.5570711905680685	0.6465075136515237	-0.5481	0.683927041341869326	4360.6233201332607	5435.7293403307704	4846.2349530197807	4269.8862044846301	3.451427801290933	3.182521915679692	1.0844945903707346	0.3597	1.28316928812380397	1355.8623260320971	1200.3978943688378	1635.1690016436639	1037.4714075464924	0.86234406081083481	0.59036096186080922	1.4607064432118597	0.7164	1.64303303256258268	1579.0928900809633	1550.7426988163966	1893.2149855961122	1308.4966901489026	1.2081331024507844	0.82027681586136303	1.4728358513730977	0.4481	1.36426900565929089	1680.6440787608049	2463.3595519828523	2016.6766235578389	1996.3890337011132	1.5746997317908396	1.6361447471093842	0.96244524488001393	0.0107	1.007421659210131310	3857.6235201150475	6730.887782531433	4335.3773487127064	5245.5305242019012	2.4871300979215896	3.1791594279361139	0.78232317513444627	-0.3985	0.7586463993195735611	2771.0505902619925	6996.2231465839086	3199.7221557493954	5447.6889849600466	2.2649430103472974	3.7820183729873897	0.59887149848990151	-0.5586	0.6789659351142978112	5180.862785827404	5455.9197323250037	5646.6436031272542	4270.3092128303524	3.5915462186747327	2.5691954278234772	1.3979264402308822	0.2234	1.167467106025836413	1171.4946496688854	1555.3811922786526	1412.4094487117873	1307.7997790139357	1.142992598863767	0.88782180833805935	1.2874121677675046	-0.0244	0.9832391293328818214	5159.5306132363012	7864.7195469120234	5630.7652371581544	6115.0544891442596	3.1288179067296489	3.3336690595912191	0.9385508431701709	-0.2179	0.8598387613658057315	1341.5679241032556	1536.3011583356836	1619.943986735738	1288.9530379999187	0.91430699741411203	0.76291917798639197	1.1984323160249883	0.1016	1.072971229002731816	594.42453616049499	1090.2730591487821	704.2466626199332	951.68835610747749	0.48393130485307978	0.67091733980430657	0.72129795452034828	-0.1861	0.8790028786898461717	317.29392834489391	250.56027059763673	306.6183878638613	288.79438929231219	0.36692813723868267	0.34859469319804209	1.0525924358527885	0.2306	1.173315067349278318	1901.4919236021478	3152.8806619741154	2235.1010882102405	2530.4095859649215	1.7879314492349434	1.889086948829219	0.94645270316595642	-0.1414	0.9066150300808977219	1192.2631054984727	1612.6153276727227	1446.6299579081606	1353.2171705248595	0.93939167358509434	0.82411292868872177	1.1398822186660715	0.0272	1.019042235267138920	714.66368108314953	1002.3802538220033	864.05804880114545	881.69171917957146	0.61728439703110372	0.63705007342955011	0.96897311966069133	-0.4785	0.71772461318937109!sample_table_end
