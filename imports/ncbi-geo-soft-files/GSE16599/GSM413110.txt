Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413110/suppl/GSM413110_NN530.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413110/suppl/GSM413110_NN531.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16599!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1655.1833508113361	2435.8534693532574	1894.9124746395773	2145.5877521805032	0.93023905076099	1.0726329772705279	0.86724822979815508	-0.1973	0.872179943116313862	2970.1345088669636	4706.3112165038465	3344.2707720961916	4078.9016037880097	1.5454102095909024	2.0052946470340696	0.77066490546745381	-0.3179	0.802211931718792023	1848.0059993089133	1797.8451769115891	2115.4568068280255	1614.0256949112504	0.97467031987971442	0.76235996770950143	1.2784909506831741	0.2117	1.15801385386953224	7512.5814144983387	10717.387668716525	7898.0821878743573	9200.8474839705541	3.3613522385953383	3.7940054288003253	0.88596400339316528	-0.2627	0.833512670210660895	14433.139035871098	14659.19271947026	14896.143481443225	12669.001737637263	7.2153629907306502	6.3512538087720429	1.1360533223794556	0.1373	1.09987795905211576	5988.6241041150788	6273.7221784640633	6410.9335781983018	5411.3847984227659	2.9338078995037491	2.6325835970180789	1.114421552586921	0.2190	1.16396049326733227	2219.2727750700501	1849.8573767040352	2528.8936540828599	1655.3829141687668	0.8502829072157595	0.61590563236932228	1.3805408856951238	0.6184	1.53522282341949298	1417.6026336727764	1691.7958771354959	1621.2138117841635	1522.6038594863639	0.78194031719400836	0.74494086761588285	1.04966763294453	0.1055	1.07583237684652219	2678.2067279526486	3480.7276532518613	3028.8539520710856	3036.7622494675766	1.3711371739638201	1.4169841419310512	0.96764468520815528	-0.0905	0.9391684595782030510	6233.9038717815083	9183.5870105525282	6650.4429201244866	7888.764709942915	2.8825222549498242	3.3671303126203753	0.85607683318516459	-0.1496	0.9014979247159525811	10648.161356068229	16065.346169787557	10926.907168348425	13939.91327744947	4.1567460443140103	5.2444313959173714	0.79260185337726219	-0.1633	0.8929999836357518412	8428.425552951534	6367.6171035643592	8773.5234034427649	5485.6634469306791	3.548637663790708	2.0818894907009842	1.7045273918914217	0.4664	1.381617045478792613	2159.6858844057788	2415.1017006884986	2460.8591237264723	2131.57712553994	1.2101000758075657	1.1043786907859292	1.0957292873392912	0.2428	1.183279099775779214	7417.3285955204065	9830.6124340511178	7796.140308768513	8438.9359343126816	3.4188999561848106	3.6382833488660054	0.93970139990620205	-0.0672	0.9545199857209004715	1991.8417227835694	2279.385884160773	2270.9251577929281	2016.5424811435296	1.0113646563833629	0.98514248713737618	1.0266176411923751	0.0737	1.05240656853137716	1124.8014255043554	2041.5476233249726	1284.4286305615769	1818.8572224897789	0.5418516551239656	0.80602695247875189	0.67225004506068253	-0.1985	0.8714315623551744917	488.62261296534246	459.81680344963962	532.45847906651522	464.33910062933609	0.22591235069741417	0.21646911731082047	1.0436239289183893	0.1575	1.115351168184993718	2914.9995055095619	4486.8517885413103	3285.5436649800949	3888.136682399348	1.5063696329137632	1.740922848260203	0.86527075821835442	-0.0212	0.985407580671143219	1744.7538807231567	2015.0785682767953	1998.3107601394504	1793.3460493894545	0.95682137996109096	0.83457254725016594	1.1464807740366285	0.1375	1.100026064172207320	1265.4546484319726	1611.9738524138293	1446.1587240992849	1459.8692789273014	0.63633063857015626	0.66726953534575728	0.9536335841264364	-0.2474	0.84242404545856497!sample_table_end
