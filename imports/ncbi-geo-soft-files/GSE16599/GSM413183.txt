Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413183/suppl/GSM413183_NN532.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413183/suppl/GSM413183_NN533.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16599!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2225.4460200078447	2735.9507968883886	2423.8015844583729	2486.6420669876434	1.1563410883475627	1.2315680171166619	0.93891776359602108	-0.0688	0.953446889115801112	2381.3708394390223	2796.4187284812569	2595.236452550489	2536.8960851047223	1.2162855894514821	1.2799150991572066	0.95028614808308531	-0.2284	0.853552673548061523	1594.091361425676	1691.2056006066293	1729.463915224813	1588.996105476961	0.88125793905691563	0.8167399270399871	1.0789945610357918	-0.0165	0.988650193882487544	6016.5305406832294	7920.8755998096003	6524.5816125383308	6819.2750637810113	3.2270514091080873	3.2096928012469252	1.005408183566483	-0.4680	0.722987884354509785	8706.7124508860561	15812.176464991127	9384.503664393731	13561.757534850876	4.4973182238993354	6.7554928232451585	0.66572762958527476	-0.4436	0.735303900954114696	5438.825497234945	6233.0766204882302	5904.053524652395	5424.3743602074646	3.1764402862232375	2.9309085219615034	1.0837732608922961	0.1395	1.10151523780238347	1329.0777505207548	1591.5191401429697	1437.2662583274071	1504.4518998049728	0.57239447025057544	0.58740213096860616	0.97445078945613717	0.0387	1.02721118357626548	1849.7739399870779	1933.0262787848978	2009.7104010601959	1798.3437763583925	1.0445034231483949	0.96617635070600605	1.0810691261332919	0.3138	1.24300814259802119	3758.9673964585045	4530.328355247425	4109.830030174865	3994.9557839765462	1.9139633046218092	1.8373348378116992	1.0417063157096484	0.1418	1.103284626657022910	5021.37391861787	8168.4889532719108	5469.5596120346318	7027.7351415537269	2.6965946761894797	3.4397096837700505	0.78395996293324122	-0.1923	0.875202747211624511	8825.7101215538314	13156.997017069591	9516.4425547385672	11215.256600890094	3.9061392057090503	4.4853961796750168	0.87085712147551364	-0.2567	0.837022765599424912	3522.3803053808783	5233.423995012995	3854.1133417411729	4580.1290795638479	1.7309805746378082	1.9959569405273296	0.86724344573309531	-0.4484	0.7328621252234602813	2001.5519771217951	2397.354809224526	2179.3885731766336	2196.8980962972132	1.0590228876298189	1.1889561739054775	0.89071650484066689	-0.0014	0.9990152799817855214	5526.2990915072023	7840.2684185440994	6005.9187883573304	6755.6279606487979	2.6561705122067081	3.1076404002359359	0.85472260947728984	-0.3448	0.7874037884779041515	1991.915005072495	2090.1735546791333	2168.7455606687772	1934.1850312421618	1.1075766176684283	1.0311202652104594	1.0741488214688164	0.1112	1.080100103988965916	1523.508344841279	2281.3847584166592	1651.9197250717307	2097.2878871115695	0.70466653810495794	0.88886247971170329	0.79277340892317982	-0.1465	0.9034329523619507617	744.54776050443218	795.97371574106819	794.58215953175363	796.81731658025922	0.33393601497941394	0.33463619645364262	0.99790763377766989	0.0912	1.065269831882806418	3002.7212717073171	3812.3370475048673	3281.1677409500753	3394.6000418365752	1.5765603729705311	1.6069880621892283	0.98106539187525443	-0.0129	0.9911139801775943319	1767.351615076391	1978.3916431618175	1920.5328033613889	1837.1689987907118	0.88538013473749722	0.90982420491331006	0.97313319425466172	0.0718	1.051062031142651320	1485.6351902285637	1567.844768741865	1608.9155867032407	1483.5479097876209	0.74875240350062711	0.72357206344829461	1.0348000445627097	-0.1400	0.90754042443912797!sample_table_end
