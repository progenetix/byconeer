The purified restricted samples were labeled with Cy5-dUTP or Cy3-dUTP by using the Agilent genomic DNA labeling kit PLUS (Agilent p/n 5188-5309) as per manufacturers instructions. Both purified labeled genomic DNA were combined.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471)!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = sex: Male!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = reference: Promega P/N G1471!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Total genomic DNA was extracted from archived samples using QIAGEN AllPrepÂ® DNA/RNA/Protein Mini Kit, as recommended by the manufacturer.!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = 1.0Âµg of total genomic DNA (gDNA) of the test sample (patient) and a references sample with concentration at least 50ng/ÂµL were digested with 5U of AluI and RsaI for 2h at 37Â°C followed by incubation for 20 minutes at 65Â°C to inactivate the enzymes.
