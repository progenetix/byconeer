Cell lines were cultured in ACL4 or RPMI growth media supplemented with 5% FBS. Xenografts were generated by injecting purified tumour cells intraperitoneally into athymic nude mice.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from cell pellets using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays werewashed and scanned according to manufacturer instructions (Affymetrix)!Sample_description = HCC5024T!Sample_data_processing = CHP files were created from CEL file intensities using the Affymetrix Genotyping Console using the BIRDSEED V2 algorithm with default settings.  CEL files were imported into Partek Genomics Suite Software with correction for fragment length, GC content, probe sequence. The corrected probe intensities were then quantile normalized. Copy number profiles were generated using Partek's Paired Copy Number Analysis workflow using patient matched constitutional DNA (ie. BloodLine) as a baseline for defining somatic alterations in each OVCA sample (tumour/cell line/xenograft). The Genomic Segmentation algorithm was applied with SNR=0.3, a 30 marker minimum segment size, and p-values < 10-7 for defining copy number alterations (CNAs).!Sample_data_processing = SNP array normalized probe data = UTSWovca_SNP_Feb2015_AllCopyNumber_transpose.txt!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Kelsie,L,Thu!Sample_contact_institute = BC Cancer Research Centre!Sample_contact_address = 675 West 10th Avenue!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_state = British Columbia!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V5Z 1L3!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1836nnn/GSM1836176/suppl/GSM1836176_GW6_031913T_WL22_HCC5024_T.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE71522!Sample_series_id = GSE71525!Sample_data_row_count = 909622
