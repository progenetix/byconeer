Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried. Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station. !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850676/suppl/GSM850676.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850676/suppl/GSM850676.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.065528	AB	-0.240525	11.725390AFFX-2315061	AB	0.000604	AB	0.070637	11.025697AFFX-2315062	AB	0.414950	AB	-0.319266	10.129298AFFX-2315057	AB	0.075358	AB	-0.117930	9.987996AFFX-2315058	BB	0.017395	BB	-0.669394	11.204157AFFX-2315059	AB	0.092954	AB	0.355027	10.653840AFFX-2315063	AA	0.024701	AA	0.745262	9.992547AFFX-2315064	AB	0.018300	AB	0.275883	10.730918AFFX-2315065	AB	0.414100	AB	-0.284507	9.915097AFFX-2315066	AB	0.153848	AB	-0.021826	9.742141AFFX-2315067	BB	0.034714	BB	-0.539766	10.978585AFFX-2315068	BB	0.063944	BB	-0.549226	10.063771AFFX-2315069	AB	0.016396	AB	-0.141157	10.871078AFFX-2315070	BB	0.111450	BB	-0.754844	9.973397AFFX-2315071	BB	0.076700	BB	-0.632425	9.077596AFFX-2315072	BB	0.129623	BB	-0.533295	9.935074AFFX-2315073	AA	0.149779	AA	0.414630	9.664889AFFX-2315074	BB	0.004414	BB	-0.650802	10.182156AFFX-2315075	BB	0.086014	BB	-0.511317	11.209081AFFX-2315076	BB	0.011348	BB	-0.590745	10.672827!sample_table_end
