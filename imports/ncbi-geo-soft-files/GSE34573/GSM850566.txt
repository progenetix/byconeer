Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried.  Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850566/suppl/GSM850566.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850566/suppl/GSM850566.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.076680	BB	-0.668356	11.372231AFFX-2315061	AB	0.021258	AB	0.056601	11.574529AFFX-2315062	NC	0.605727	AB	-0.279638	9.530338AFFX-2315057	AB	0.196460	AB	0.028701	9.799496AFFX-2315058	AB	0.189164	AB	0.219572	12.674194AFFX-2315059	AB	0.000702	AB	0.168136	10.969090AFFX-2315063	BB	0.001788	BB	-0.814314	10.836271AFFX-2315064	AA	0.148823	AA	0.811550	10.768546AFFX-2315065	BB	0.031840	BB	-0.465259	10.077896AFFX-2315066	AB	0.031139	AB	0.006865	10.204345AFFX-2315067	AB	0.095275	AB	-0.099219	11.432576AFFX-2315068	BB	0.004370	BB	-0.773960	10.653365AFFX-2315069	AB	0.067548	AB	-0.126087	11.459085AFFX-2315070	BB	0.099318	BB	-0.604369	9.798802AFFX-2315071	BB	0.030279	BB	-0.821818	10.409587AFFX-2315072	NC	0.682443	AB	-0.325664	9.892859AFFX-2315073	AB	0.301644	AB	-0.029377	9.657236AFFX-2315074	AA	0.073399	AA	0.745343	10.035160AFFX-2315075	AB	0.023733	AB	-0.032878	11.533498AFFX-2315076	BB	0.156840	BB	-0.697819	11.515265!sample_table_end
