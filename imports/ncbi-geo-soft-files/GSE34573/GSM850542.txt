Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried.  Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850542/suppl/GSM850542.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850542/suppl/GSM850542.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	NC	0.874927	BB	-0.433524	11.611733AFFX-2315061	AA	0.032670	AA	0.786321	10.613798AFFX-2315062	AB	0.028692	AB	0.008601	10.043590AFFX-2315057	AB	0.143230	AB	0.093406	10.110580AFFX-2315058	AB	0.128740	AB	0.295097	12.096325AFFX-2315059	AB	0.327941	AB	0.507257	10.706893AFFX-2315063	BB	0.000527	BB	-0.799089	10.734611AFFX-2315064	AB	0.160722	AB	-0.014693	10.443712AFFX-2315065	BB	0.401680	BB	-0.375383	10.248934AFFX-2315066	AA	0.028270	AA	0.760448	10.708846AFFX-2315067	BB	0.072794	BB	-0.544148	11.319247AFFX-2315068	AB	0.216676	AB	0.424220	11.083572AFFX-2315069	AB	0.075872	AB	-0.226426	11.383410AFFX-2315070	AA	0.459570	AA	0.203120	9.543237AFFX-2315071	AB	0.009006	AB	-0.120387	9.814949AFFX-2315072	AB	0.162125	AB	0.160232	10.156594AFFX-2315073	AA	0.127763	AA	0.522766	9.732578AFFX-2315074	AA	0.203573	AA	0.562093	9.605593AFFX-2315075	AB	0.034399	AB	-0.076169	11.518311AFFX-2315076	AB	0.006188	AB	0.040060	11.011491!sample_table_end
