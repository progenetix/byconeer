Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried.  Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850562/suppl/GSM850562.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850562/suppl/GSM850562.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.094093	BB	-0.622596	11.344217AFFX-2315061	BB	0.071190	BB	-0.741280	11.546318AFFX-2315062	NC	0.515006	AB	-0.336521	9.903678AFFX-2315057	AB	0.170415	AB	0.015057	9.822453AFFX-2315058	AA	0.172284	AA	0.574772	12.315910AFFX-2315059	AB	0.006099	AB	0.077528	10.941825AFFX-2315063	AB	0.012697	AB	-0.279544	10.817216AFFX-2315064	BB	0.081382	BB	-0.506502	10.161138AFFX-2315065	AB	0.068910	AB	0.053198	10.355987AFFX-2315066	NC	0.825813	BB	-0.311198	9.923868AFFX-2315067	AA	0.016391	AA	0.596188	11.320090AFFX-2315068	AB	0.294849	AB	-0.321199	10.640690AFFX-2315069	AA	0.095547	AA	0.628148	10.411333AFFX-2315070	AA	0.303912	AA	0.251291	9.540977AFFX-2315071	BB	0.003999	BB	-0.779856	10.001571AFFX-2315072	NC	0.952886	AA	0.339754	10.064817AFFX-2315073	AB	0.311873	AB	0.167500	9.532483AFFX-2315074	BB	0.233964	BB	-0.513977	10.053693AFFX-2315075	AB	0.241456	AB	0.237212	11.314181AFFX-2315076	AB	0.001372	AB	-0.053502	10.870803!sample_table_end
