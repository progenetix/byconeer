Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried. Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station. !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850640/suppl/GSM850640.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850640/suppl/GSM850640.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	NC	0.571755	AA	0.238819	10.840418AFFX-2315061	AB	0.002560	AB	0.103715	10.883092AFFX-2315062	BB	0.022461	BB	-0.628115	10.222412AFFX-2315057	AB	0.244586	AB	0.111408	10.051336AFFX-2315058	AA	0.458487	AA	0.577171	11.980183AFFX-2315059	BB	0.305410	BB	-0.582119	10.559183AFFX-2315063	AB	0.020357	AB	-0.194280	10.795035AFFX-2315064	AB	0.188019	AB	-0.201480	10.921820AFFX-2315065	AB	0.099066	AB	-0.017061	10.251158AFFX-2315066	BB	0.061665	BB	-0.635524	10.488114AFFX-2315067	BB	0.021777	BB	-0.491454	10.797726AFFX-2315068	AB	0.180817	AB	-0.170466	10.644369AFFX-2315069	AB	0.019025	AB	-0.185438	10.866889AFFX-2315070	BB	0.145747	BB	-0.627854	9.698593AFFX-2315071	NC	0.787749	AB	-0.527359	9.805034AFFX-2315072	AB	0.151887	AB	0.146415	10.032799AFFX-2315073	AA	0.054850	AA	0.637958	10.457345AFFX-2315074	AA	0.240561	AA	0.680237	10.826376AFFX-2315075	AA	0.093054	AA	0.522074	11.151549AFFX-2315076	BB	0.005109	BB	-0.600875	10.474813!sample_table_end
