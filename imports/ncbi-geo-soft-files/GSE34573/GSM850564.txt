Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried.  Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850564/suppl/GSM850564.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850564/suppl/GSM850564.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.137104	AB	-0.227110	11.524928AFFX-2315061	AB	0.013911	AB	0.081132	11.480791AFFX-2315062	NC	0.610134	BB	-0.423887	9.746941AFFX-2315057	AA	0.462283	AA	0.311636	10.001313AFFX-2315058	AA	0.041698	AA	0.641542	12.204916AFFX-2315059	AB	0.009734	AB	0.252109	10.793320AFFX-2315063	AA	0.017701	AA	0.722571	10.247284AFFX-2315064	AB	0.151594	AB	0.328950	10.170814AFFX-2315065	AA	0.026194	AA	0.419421	10.059327AFFX-2315066	BB	0.042165	BB	-0.639066	10.077288AFFX-2315067	AB	0.297115	AB	0.263833	10.994611AFFX-2315068	AA	0.113022	AA	0.667979	10.196095AFFX-2315069	AA	0.034445	AA	0.826695	10.833291AFFX-2315070	BB	0.202711	BB	-0.501555	9.629418AFFX-2315071	AA	0.005991	AA	0.823459	10.079755AFFX-2315072	AA	0.224908	AA	0.483851	9.965868AFFX-2315073	AA	0.274060	AA	0.455597	9.449838AFFX-2315074	AA	0.095844	AA	0.799197	10.148968AFFX-2315075	AB	0.006651	AB	0.023764	11.378559AFFX-2315076	AA	0.072134	AA	0.535597	10.658885!sample_table_end
