Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried. Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station. !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850642/suppl/GSM850642.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850642/suppl/GSM850642.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.192212	BB	-0.580982	10.835717AFFX-2315061	BB	0.002661	BB	-0.783481	10.772054AFFX-2315062	AB	0.010214	AB	-0.101298	10.551659AFFX-2315057	AA	0.083898	AA	0.392244	10.070369AFFX-2315058	AA	0.012879	AA	0.696650	11.564999AFFX-2315059	AB	0.121286	AB	0.451985	10.238683AFFX-2315063	AB	0.029776	AB	-0.256519	10.395329AFFX-2315064	BB	0.094493	BB	-0.668751	10.645247AFFX-2315065	AB	0.017828	AB	-0.114951	10.033649AFFX-2315066	AB	0.190615	AB	-0.067686	9.736192AFFX-2315067	AA	0.000987	AA	0.588717	10.753237AFFX-2315068	AB	0.190197	AB	-0.063951	10.161405AFFX-2315069	AA	0.126006	AA	0.631391	10.371117AFFX-2315070	AA	0.156393	AA	0.288231	9.160980AFFX-2315071	BB	0.249756	BB	-0.507198	8.797593AFFX-2315072	AB	0.051189	AB	-0.029378	10.122986AFFX-2315073	NC	0.689654	AB	-0.109346	9.690815AFFX-2315074	BB	0.078647	BB	-0.601310	10.338481AFFX-2315075	AA	0.423580	AA	0.445451	11.481041AFFX-2315076	AB	0.019131	AB	0.041883	10.360996!sample_table_end
