Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried.  Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850569/suppl/GSM850569.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850569/suppl/GSM850569.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.001151	AB	-0.145730	11.887525AFFX-2315061	AA	0.017360	AA	0.856638	11.379343AFFX-2315062	NC	0.546817	AB	0.234045	10.121123AFFX-2315057	AB	0.195023	AB	0.088667	9.971617AFFX-2315058	AB	0.015006	AB	0.179348	11.775822AFFX-2315059	AB	0.456079	AB	-0.287493	10.326713AFFX-2315063	AB	0.353990	AB	-0.503536	10.842930AFFX-2315064	BB	0.320691	BB	-0.321760	10.047480AFFX-2315065	AB	0.017379	AB	-0.109522	10.118531AFFX-2315066	AB	0.486886	AB	0.317113	10.038074AFFX-2315067	BB	0.081159	BB	-0.510522	11.235935AFFX-2315068	AA	0.127019	AA	0.645803	10.322929AFFX-2315069	BB	0.032717	BB	-0.757991	10.346659AFFX-2315070	AA	0.132245	AA	0.350284	9.596165AFFX-2315071	AA	0.029163	AA	0.691194	9.799832AFFX-2315072	NC	0.735235	AB	0.326492	10.211249AFFX-2315073	AB	0.438403	AB	0.145305	9.382258AFFX-2315074	NC	0.510805	BB	-0.377388	9.643749AFFX-2315075	AB	0.132391	AB	0.185492	11.462324AFFX-2315076	AA	0.304690	AA	0.497138	11.090340!sample_table_end
