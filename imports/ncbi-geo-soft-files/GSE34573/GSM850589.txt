Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried. Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station. !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850589/suppl/GSM850589.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850589/suppl/GSM850589.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.265128	AA	0.401166	10.867766AFFX-2315061	AA	0.008274	AA	0.771095	10.819338AFFX-2315062	AA	0.050048	AA	0.474967	10.472868AFFX-2315057	AB	0.078444	AB	-0.249199	10.373528AFFX-2315058	BB	0.007507	BB	-0.677151	11.086656AFFX-2315059	AB	0.069193	AB	0.418230	10.278002AFFX-2315063	AB	0.145601	AB	0.281192	10.514360AFFX-2315064	AB	0.020137	AB	0.221033	10.825148AFFX-2315065	BB	0.045195	BB	-0.503391	10.186015AFFX-2315066	AA	0.025806	AA	0.672927	9.937139AFFX-2315067	BB	0.100486	BB	-0.444723	10.865555AFFX-2315068	BB	0.055380	BB	-0.541000	10.155086AFFX-2315069	AA	0.009441	AA	0.770452	10.404547AFFX-2315070	BB	0.036143	BB	-0.667256	10.066038AFFX-2315071	AB	0.246828	AB	-0.319415	9.218544AFFX-2315072	BB	0.097291	BB	-0.517301	10.163067AFFX-2315073	NC	0.773847	AB	-0.203257	9.935779AFFX-2315074	BB	0.106205	BB	-0.662181	10.575363AFFX-2315075	AA	0.126550	AA	0.607564	11.671360AFFX-2315076	BB	0.013151	BB	-0.535036	10.548985!sample_table_end
