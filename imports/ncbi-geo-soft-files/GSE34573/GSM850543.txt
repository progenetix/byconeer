Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried.  Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850543/suppl/GSM850543.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850543/suppl/GSM850543.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.091506	AA	0.470821	11.874824AFFX-2315061	AA	0.165539	AA	0.821695	12.111975AFFX-2315062	AB	0.078184	AB	-0.173562	9.931994AFFX-2315057	AB	0.137361	AB	-0.110498	10.025550AFFX-2315058	AB	0.084623	AB	0.164863	11.395407AFFX-2315059	AB	0.008779	AB	0.058669	10.842224AFFX-2315063	BB	0.073314	BB	-0.806835	10.377269AFFX-2315064	BB	0.010875	BB	-0.506032	9.833968AFFX-2315065	AA	0.113285	AA	0.348342	9.981332AFFX-2315066	AB	0.200310	AB	-0.000334	9.780331AFFX-2315067	BB	0.218431	BB	-0.385425	10.577336AFFX-2315068	NC	0.602942	AB	0.419371	10.178096AFFX-2315069	AA	0.021732	AA	0.678804	9.856058AFFX-2315070	BB	0.093519	BB	-0.596662	9.817795AFFX-2315071	AA	0.055604	AA	0.675966	9.249665AFFX-2315072	NC	0.725709	BB	-0.424365	10.181519AFFX-2315073	AA	0.001953	AA	0.718881	10.235877AFFX-2315074	AB	0.263130	AB	-0.204425	9.509377AFFX-2315075	NC	0.855574	AA	0.350224	11.156354AFFX-2315076	AB	0.180750	AB	0.075977	10.236028!sample_table_end
