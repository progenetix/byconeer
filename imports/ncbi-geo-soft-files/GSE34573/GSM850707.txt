Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried. Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station.!Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850707/suppl/GSM850707.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850707/suppl/GSM850707.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.314063	AB	-0.321933	11.530676AFFX-2315061	AA	0.017094	AA	0.763443	10.581654AFFX-2315062	AA	0.172985	AA	0.357911	10.334033AFFX-2315057	NC	0.665634	AA	0.275966	10.172006AFFX-2315058	AB	0.019197	AB	0.092790	11.127645AFFX-2315059	AB	0.048732	AB	-0.026891	10.041427AFFX-2315063	AB	0.114368	AB	-0.367875	10.476068AFFX-2315064	BB	0.315317	BB	-0.529782	10.550694AFFX-2315065	AB	0.086533	AB	0.017355	10.138348AFFX-2315066	AB	0.065972	AB	0.171292	10.059048AFFX-2315067	BB	0.140071	BB	-0.435562	10.909844AFFX-2315068	AA	0.390178	AA	0.507725	9.942163AFFX-2315069	BB	0.067030	BB	-0.739440	9.952618AFFX-2315070	AA	0.226788	AA	0.307394	9.594076AFFX-2315071	NC	0.516499	AA	0.353317	8.885713AFFX-2315072	AB	0.033219	AB	0.085697	10.232759AFFX-2315073	AA	0.308490	AA	0.208105	9.412457AFFX-2315074	BB	0.100777	BB	-0.570480	10.252824AFFX-2315075	AA	0.248662	AA	0.483924	11.444731AFFX-2315076	AA	0.039015	AA	0.538162	10.425797!sample_table_end
