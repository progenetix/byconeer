Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried. Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station. !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850674/suppl/GSM850674.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850674/suppl/GSM850674.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.159257	BB	-0.639310	10.949496AFFX-2315061	AB	0.023300	AB	-0.033799	10.705803AFFX-2315062	AB	0.216808	AB	0.049537	10.165677AFFX-2315057	AB	0.055293	AB	-0.011990	10.055348AFFX-2315058	AB	0.237727	AB	0.304399	11.984659AFFX-2315059	AB	0.001004	AB	0.247596	10.292024AFFX-2315063	BB	0.033669	BB	-0.722060	10.483136AFFX-2315064	AA	0.157842	AA	0.856303	11.027792AFFX-2315065	AB	0.170051	AB	-0.196231	10.207783AFFX-2315066	AB	0.038085	AB	0.072378	9.991783AFFX-2315067	AB	0.008261	AB	0.029952	10.983765AFFX-2315068	BB	0.058022	BB	-0.656831	10.062590AFFX-2315069	AB	0.052242	AB	0.065347	11.044819AFFX-2315070	BB	0.249243	BB	-0.509043	9.787766AFFX-2315071	BB	0.015062	BB	-0.724381	9.330438AFFX-2315072	BB	0.444858	BB	-0.392927	10.000678AFFX-2315073	NC	0.535952	BB	-0.268650	9.582979AFFX-2315074	AA	0.037922	AA	0.796584	10.443170AFFX-2315075	AB	0.021503	AB	-0.051107	11.222189AFFX-2315076	BB	0.014262	BB	-0.596692	10.697684!sample_table_end
