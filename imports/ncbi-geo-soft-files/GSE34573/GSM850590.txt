Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried. Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station. !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850590/suppl/GSM850590.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850590/suppl/GSM850590.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.112912	AB	-0.107432	11.293173AFFX-2315061	AA	0.001609	AA	0.803986	10.785717AFFX-2315062	AA	0.015185	AA	0.525916	10.122621AFFX-2315057	AB	0.002621	AB	-0.108035	10.252315AFFX-2315058	BB	0.041667	BB	-0.629361	11.258064AFFX-2315059	BB	0.369560	BB	-0.511556	10.330523AFFX-2315063	AB	0.012169	AB	0.044385	10.731194AFFX-2315064	AA	0.129946	AA	0.868149	10.984778AFFX-2315065	AA	0.042557	AA	0.541357	10.051234AFFX-2315066	AB	0.152952	AB	-0.191246	10.052954AFFX-2315067	AB	0.076421	AB	0.212373	11.072803AFFX-2315068	BB	0.119493	BB	-0.482393	10.174866AFFX-2315069	AB	0.008521	AB	-0.154005	10.758235AFFX-2315070	AB	0.324501	AB	-0.402812	10.417322AFFX-2315071	AA	0.076971	AA	0.610527	8.904734AFFX-2315072	AB	0.117685	AB	-0.139254	10.144423AFFX-2315073	BB	0.235756	BB	-0.405319	9.941686AFFX-2315074	AA	0.080966	AA	0.847360	10.757349AFFX-2315075	AB	0.234485	AB	0.140160	11.766755AFFX-2315076	AB	0.005689	AB	-0.005551	10.487928!sample_table_end
