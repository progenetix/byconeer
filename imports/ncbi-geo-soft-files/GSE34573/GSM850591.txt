Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried. Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station. !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850591/suppl/GSM850591.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850591/suppl/GSM850591.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.261950	BB	-0.480714	11.176112AFFX-2315061	AA	0.109359	AA	0.738760	9.921543AFFX-2315062	NC	0.733781	AA	0.235399	10.277491AFFX-2315057	AB	0.026743	AB	-0.006959	10.219491AFFX-2315058	AB	0.239072	AB	0.374197	11.555179AFFX-2315059	AB	0.040127	AB	0.382911	10.263814AFFX-2315063	BB	0.038960	BB	-0.782519	10.871835AFFX-2315064	AB	0.187367	AB	-0.176711	11.154047AFFX-2315065	BB	0.399796	BB	-0.398000	10.322324AFFX-2315066	AA	0.069098	AA	0.838324	10.777764AFFX-2315067	BB	0.116849	BB	-0.643688	11.331191AFFX-2315068	NC	0.697074	AB	0.545756	10.859361AFFX-2315069	AB	0.095794	AB	-0.266494	11.274642AFFX-2315070	AA	0.073304	AA	0.509328	9.276868AFFX-2315071	AB	0.028348	AB	0.050206	9.542710AFFX-2315072	AB	0.046696	AB	-0.068944	10.196324AFFX-2315073	AA	0.108283	AA	0.501610	9.645741AFFX-2315074	AA	0.020124	AA	0.853175	10.264846AFFX-2315075	AB	0.011689	AB	0.010513	11.292200AFFX-2315076	AB	0.005219	AB	-0.014029	10.585518!sample_table_end
