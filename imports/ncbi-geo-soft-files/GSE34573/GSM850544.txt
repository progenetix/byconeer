Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried.  Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850544/suppl/GSM850544.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850544/suppl/GSM850544.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	NC	0.959620	AA	0.234786	11.392530AFFX-2315061	AA	0.025273	AA	0.837065	11.405913AFFX-2315062	BB	0.448786	BB	-0.439103	9.314158AFFX-2315057	AB	0.294848	AB	-0.075874	9.673325AFFX-2315058	AB	0.011857	AB	0.061907	12.026393AFFX-2315059	AA	0.183753	AA	0.737447	10.436318AFFX-2315063	BB	0.047274	BB	-0.742710	10.467752AFFX-2315064	BB	0.038942	BB	-0.607658	9.998835AFFX-2315065	BB	0.069028	BB	-0.516620	10.487978AFFX-2315066	NC	0.811157	BB	-0.304548	9.864295AFFX-2315067	AB	0.013783	AB	0.114687	11.221416AFFX-2315068	BB	0.045897	BB	-0.678406	10.045465AFFX-2315069	BB	0.008462	BB	-0.779630	10.046909AFFX-2315070	AA	0.120539	AA	0.368686	9.700054AFFX-2315071	AA	0.047430	AA	0.670524	9.342297AFFX-2315072	AB	0.151485	AB	-0.145434	9.978398AFFX-2315073	AB	0.357905	AB	0.167863	9.488270AFFX-2315074	AA	0.088000	AA	0.631618	9.773018AFFX-2315075	AA	0.342677	AA	0.433308	11.334830AFFX-2315076	AA	0.220909	AA	0.472512	10.722074!sample_table_end
