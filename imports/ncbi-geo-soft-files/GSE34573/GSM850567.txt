Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried.  Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850567/suppl/GSM850567.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850567/suppl/GSM850567.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.432471	AA	0.323062	11.496778AFFX-2315061	AA	0.027561	AA	0.802277	10.615293AFFX-2315062	AB	0.390125	AB	-0.207675	9.500769AFFX-2315057	BB	0.363711	BB	-0.435353	9.887245AFFX-2315058	AB	0.146287	AB	0.179887	12.644537AFFX-2315059	AB	0.038185	AB	-0.068714	11.050111AFFX-2315063	AA	0.060931	AA	0.732159	9.851763AFFX-2315064	BB	0.054341	BB	-0.498748	10.057654AFFX-2315065	BB	0.017173	BB	-0.554985	10.391384AFFX-2315066	AA	0.094416	AA	0.588964	9.766298AFFX-2315067	BB	0.074549	BB	-0.616921	11.463060AFFX-2315068	BB	0.002725	BB	-0.715582	10.436839AFFX-2315069	AA	0.023035	AA	0.826199	10.718663AFFX-2315070	AA	0.101116	AA	0.409520	9.416197AFFX-2315071	AA	0.000619	AA	0.772430	9.803111AFFX-2315072	AB	0.102080	AB	-0.032344	9.949159AFFX-2315073	AA	0.129227	AA	0.562281	9.586756AFFX-2315074	AB	0.183220	AB	-0.062225	9.046729AFFX-2315075	AB	0.053457	AB	0.046587	11.669549AFFX-2315076	AA	0.015830	AA	0.661166	11.112217!sample_table_end
