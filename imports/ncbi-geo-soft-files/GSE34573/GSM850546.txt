Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried.  Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850546/suppl/GSM850546.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850546/suppl/GSM850546.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.019578	BB	-0.665055	11.874303AFFX-2315061	AB	0.026124	AB	0.002891	11.529883AFFX-2315062	AA	0.360984	AA	0.327659	9.646549AFFX-2315057	NC	0.514648	AA	0.290766	9.760633AFFX-2315058	AA	0.193448	AA	0.653341	12.730733AFFX-2315059	AB	0.104833	AB	-0.137609	11.410953AFFX-2315063	AB	0.001562	AB	-0.196591	10.867500AFFX-2315064	AA	0.041162	AA	0.707592	10.159545AFFX-2315065	AA	0.073346	AA	0.441452	10.308885AFFX-2315066	BB	0.082285	BB	-0.530360	10.169639AFFX-2315067	BB	0.044942	BB	-0.567684	11.281350AFFX-2315068	AA	0.076981	AA	0.797508	11.001289AFFX-2315069	AB	0.034036	AB	-0.182572	11.034972AFFX-2315070	AB	0.262641	AB	-0.101542	9.651272AFFX-2315071	NC	0.798575	BB	-0.618112	10.522180AFFX-2315072	AA	0.377572	AA	0.426551	10.042407AFFX-2315073	AA	0.010690	AA	0.637148	10.070349AFFX-2315074	AA	0.072986	AA	0.786692	10.051017AFFX-2315075	AB	0.390226	AB	0.251183	10.943335AFFX-2315076	AB	0.073513	AB	-0.197628	10.734349!sample_table_end
