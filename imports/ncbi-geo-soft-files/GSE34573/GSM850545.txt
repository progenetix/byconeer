Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried.  Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850545/suppl/GSM850545.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850545/suppl/GSM850545.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.071467	AA	0.463589	11.674945AFFX-2315061	AB	0.033798	AB	0.166280	11.621590AFFX-2315062	BB	0.030491	BB	-0.668267	9.908438AFFX-2315057	AB	0.369834	AB	0.057381	9.599022AFFX-2315058	AA	0.263631	AA	0.594025	12.676934AFFX-2315059	BB	0.087696	BB	-0.668575	11.030923AFFX-2315063	AB	0.016919	AB	-0.193324	11.140125AFFX-2315064	AB	0.099396	AB	0.083997	10.334799AFFX-2315065	AB	0.017878	AB	-0.113016	10.256507AFFX-2315066	BB	0.016061	BB	-0.672871	10.234455AFFX-2315067	BB	0.033149	BB	-0.503375	11.009879AFFX-2315068	AB	0.224414	AB	-0.325560	11.257033AFFX-2315069	AB	0.032980	AB	-0.152661	11.056000AFFX-2315070	BB	0.136556	BB	-0.662452	9.763876AFFX-2315071	NC	0.505129	AB	-0.543205	10.740197AFFX-2315072	AA	0.453010	AA	0.399234	9.732821AFFX-2315073	AA	0.004898	AA	0.661911	10.203925AFFX-2315074	AA	0.144352	AA	0.681730	10.075166AFFX-2315075	AA	0.129244	AA	0.462701	10.999139AFFX-2315076	BB	0.027030	BB	-0.665393	11.095002!sample_table_end
