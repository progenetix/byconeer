Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried. Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station. !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850593/suppl/GSM850593.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850593/suppl/GSM850593.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	NC	0.917476	AA	0.234500	11.234620AFFX-2315061	AA	0.047824	AA	0.711257	10.711911AFFX-2315062	BB	0.432463	BB	-0.461688	10.190471AFFX-2315057	NC	0.841777	AB	0.260715	10.467224AFFX-2315058	AB	0.020229	AB	0.080953	11.435472AFFX-2315059	NC	0.769117	AA	0.623575	10.413591AFFX-2315063	BB	0.063001	BB	-0.701787	10.554166AFFX-2315064	BB	0.247927	BB	-0.605450	10.799833AFFX-2315065	BB	0.255835	BB	-0.487880	10.592235AFFX-2315066	BB	0.455241	BB	-0.437141	10.082355AFFX-2315067	AB	0.051004	AB	0.110194	11.207642AFFX-2315068	AB	0.468050	AB	-0.193564	10.186895AFFX-2315069	BB	0.045663	BB	-0.747992	10.179910AFFX-2315070	AA	0.156287	AA	0.418843	9.957442AFFX-2315071	AA	0.450779	AA	0.424623	9.259582AFFX-2315072	AB	0.051236	AB	-0.152863	10.451435AFFX-2315073	AB	0.121143	AB	0.182405	10.194047AFFX-2315074	AA	0.387661	AA	0.609008	10.477794AFFX-2315075	NC	0.594507	AA	0.418871	11.551468AFFX-2315076	AA	0.297927	AA	0.436058	10.436505!sample_table_end
