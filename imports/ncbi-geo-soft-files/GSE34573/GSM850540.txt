Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried.  Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850540/suppl/GSM850540.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850540/suppl/GSM850540.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.022069	AA	0.536922	11.578924AFFX-2315061	AA	0.013157	AA	0.874418	11.347163AFFX-2315062	AA	0.222876	AA	0.396745	9.473640AFFX-2315057	AB	0.281857	AB	-0.040832	9.621206AFFX-2315058	BB	0.009651	BB	-0.718589	11.899871AFFX-2315059	AB	0.034996	AB	0.382855	10.956466AFFX-2315063	AB	0.118206	AB	0.209819	10.800781AFFX-2315064	AB	0.003054	AB	0.242194	9.861583AFFX-2315065	BB	0.027844	BB	-0.481211	10.236296AFFX-2315066	AA	0.046597	AA	0.706070	9.801268AFFX-2315067	BB	0.000264	BB	-0.583082	10.975874AFFX-2315068	BB	0.022691	BB	-0.791542	10.367756AFFX-2315069	AA	0.041082	AA	0.867602	10.938680AFFX-2315070	BB	0.111964	BB	-0.576775	9.768453AFFX-2315071	AB	0.051645	AB	-0.202154	9.542474AFFX-2315072	BB	0.270016	BB	-0.573856	9.932261AFFX-2315073	BB	0.277112	BB	-0.340053	9.192784AFFX-2315074	BB	0.011117	BB	-0.537868	9.437351AFFX-2315075	AA	0.028003	AA	0.545733	11.177874AFFX-2315076	BB	0.005455	BB	-0.670672	10.800647!sample_table_end
