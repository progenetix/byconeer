Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried. Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station. !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850675/suppl/GSM850675.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850675/suppl/GSM850675.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.403421	AA	0.306728	10.845206AFFX-2315061	AA	0.159121	AA	0.641282	9.743298AFFX-2315062	NC	0.710949	AA	0.169862	9.728920AFFX-2315057	NC	0.631749	BB	-0.392771	10.119611AFFX-2315058	AB	0.180415	AB	0.224121	12.031992AFFX-2315059	AB	0.106793	AB	-0.131277	10.655934AFFX-2315063	AA	0.018787	AA	0.803348	10.070879AFFX-2315064	BB	0.067380	BB	-0.705334	10.631320AFFX-2315065	BB	0.059954	BB	-0.516346	10.247005AFFX-2315066	AA	0.086286	AA	0.661196	9.612209AFFX-2315067	BB	0.082838	BB	-0.631739	11.219108AFFX-2315068	BB	0.174402	BB	-0.466864	9.794485AFFX-2315069	AA	0.010965	AA	0.807484	10.515517AFFX-2315070	AA	0.093912	AA	0.476807	9.133307AFFX-2315071	AA	0.024174	AA	0.614817	9.226763AFFX-2315072	BB	0.151622	BB	-0.489518	10.027070AFFX-2315073	AA	0.076521	AA	0.572360	9.812734AFFX-2315074	NC	0.647392	BB	-0.380603	9.604458AFFX-2315075	AB	0.215500	AB	0.238068	11.457320AFFX-2315076	AA	0.008737	AA	0.672875	10.616113!sample_table_end
