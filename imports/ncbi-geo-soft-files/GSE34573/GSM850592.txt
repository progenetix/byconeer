Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried. Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station. !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850592/suppl/GSM850592.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850592/suppl/GSM850592.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.151154	AA	0.467306	11.771904AFFX-2315061	AA	0.103658	AA	0.831217	11.713151AFFX-2315062	AB	0.038536	AB	-0.221186	10.583837AFFX-2315057	AB	0.106260	AB	-0.202491	10.731871AFFX-2315058	AB	0.087629	AB	0.155687	10.841151AFFX-2315059	AB	0.048692	AB	0.156591	10.699247AFFX-2315063	BB	0.081545	BB	-0.778506	10.226436AFFX-2315064	BB	0.020093	BB	-0.766916	10.440364AFFX-2315065	AA	0.000780	AA	0.450440	9.796849AFFX-2315066	AB	0.034321	AB	-0.031632	10.038793AFFX-2315067	BB	0.087171	BB	-0.420366	10.576385AFFX-2315068	NC	0.625978	AA	0.434100	9.898210AFFX-2315069	AA	0.011952	AA	0.734925	10.204834AFFX-2315070	BB	0.049087	BB	-0.662339	10.009155AFFX-2315071	AA	0.093717	AA	0.550512	8.924044AFFX-2315072	BB	0.115355	BB	-0.519142	10.014211AFFX-2315073	AA	0.022174	AA	0.803174	10.709299AFFX-2315074	AB	0.022925	AB	-0.070653	10.013928AFFX-2315075	AA	0.264766	AA	0.470916	11.333283AFFX-2315076	NC	0.608544	AB	0.213636	9.850227!sample_table_end
