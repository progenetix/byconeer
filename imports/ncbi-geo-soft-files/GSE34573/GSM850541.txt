Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried.  Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850541/suppl/GSM850541.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850541/suppl/GSM850541.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.036693	AB	-0.153308	11.643508AFFX-2315061	AA	0.006425	AA	0.862644	11.246721AFFX-2315062	NC	0.580344	AB	0.171224	9.718186AFFX-2315057	AB	0.149876	AB	-0.123950	10.034328AFFX-2315058	BB	0.001059	BB	-0.721349	11.671842AFFX-2315059	BB	0.046108	BB	-0.636555	10.623332AFFX-2315063	AB	0.012948	AB	-0.010985	10.786829AFFX-2315064	AA	0.007280	AA	0.711698	9.975029AFFX-2315065	AA	0.240152	AA	0.323986	10.128293AFFX-2315066	AB	0.129698	AB	0.023988	9.894567AFFX-2315067	AB	0.076739	AB	0.183324	11.292396AFFX-2315068	BB	0.059749	BB	-0.659335	9.985023AFFX-2315069	AB	0.030400	AB	-0.244986	10.790987AFFX-2315070	AB	0.070449	AB	-0.263711	10.302863AFFX-2315071	AA	0.087624	AA	0.655109	9.089962AFFX-2315072	AB	0.044807	AB	0.000241	10.232746AFFX-2315073	NC	0.657868	BB	-0.209836	9.589700AFFX-2315074	AA	0.054830	AA	0.653978	9.775185AFFX-2315075	AB	0.026985	AB	-0.058361	11.509747AFFX-2315076	AB	0.016702	AB	0.057056	10.740164!sample_table_end
