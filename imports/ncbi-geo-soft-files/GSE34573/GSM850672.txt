Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried. Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station. !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850672/suppl/GSM850672.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850672/suppl/GSM850672.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.205913	AB	-0.153022	11.193338AFFX-2315061	AB	0.014247	AB	-0.044888	11.112788AFFX-2315062	AB	0.009291	AB	-0.184892	10.412565AFFX-2315057	AA	0.027260	AA	0.464807	10.213042AFFX-2315058	AA	0.122434	AA	0.631564	11.700007AFFX-2315059	AB	0.010047	AB	0.289230	10.385880AFFX-2315063	AA	0.004068	AA	0.770002	10.308907AFFX-2315064	AB	0.042495	AB	0.295803	10.904514AFFX-2315065	AA	0.057719	AA	0.588116	10.073127AFFX-2315066	BB	0.030392	BB	-0.656054	10.432287AFFX-2315067	AB	0.148203	AB	0.259744	11.088356AFFX-2315068	AA	0.071886	AA	0.726212	10.138432AFFX-2315069	AA	0.038917	AA	0.848901	10.772964AFFX-2315070	BB	0.375873	BB	-0.483201	9.873856AFFX-2315071	AA	0.016944	AA	0.743347	9.686307AFFX-2315072	AB	0.055922	AB	0.151699	10.283778AFFX-2315073	AA	0.085383	AA	0.682604	9.922851AFFX-2315074	AA	0.112024	AA	0.874970	10.972510AFFX-2315075	AB	0.028303	AB	0.088410	11.374674AFFX-2315076	AA	0.166389	AA	0.483606	10.567672!sample_table_end
