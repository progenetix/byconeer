Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried. Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station. !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850641/suppl/GSM850641.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850641/suppl/GSM850641.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.026463	BB	-0.655878	11.425813AFFX-2315061	AB	0.008389	AB	-0.013729	10.844413AFFX-2315062	AA	0.119032	AA	0.370971	10.203955AFFX-2315057	AA	0.182239	AA	0.332313	9.684952AFFX-2315058	AA	0.245981	AA	0.688322	12.101896AFFX-2315059	AB	0.054708	AB	-0.083619	10.466898AFFX-2315063	AB	0.013147	AB	-0.057990	10.350915AFFX-2315064	AA	0.066881	AA	0.819364	10.742537AFFX-2315065	AA	0.004608	AA	0.448618	9.853224AFFX-2315066	BB	0.032176	BB	-0.607631	10.082133AFFX-2315067	BB	0.003360	BB	-0.577032	10.801501AFFX-2315068	AA	0.072567	AA	0.752194	10.142527AFFX-2315069	AB	0.009232	AB	-0.156422	10.768265AFFX-2315070	AB	0.293510	AB	-0.197980	9.725784AFFX-2315071	BB	0.157720	BB	-0.620740	9.521201AFFX-2315072	NC	0.804723	AB	0.333245	10.140711AFFX-2315073	AA	0.063402	AA	0.669105	9.969109AFFX-2315074	AA	0.080409	AA	0.884737	10.746988AFFX-2315075	NC	0.924486	AA	0.351235	10.364763AFFX-2315076	AB	0.084431	AB	0.038575	10.149677!sample_table_end
