Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried.  Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850565/suppl/GSM850565.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850565/suppl/GSM850565.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.100029	AB	-0.268094	11.718074AFFX-2315061	AA	0.039012	AA	0.827990	11.479756AFFX-2315062	AB	0.401738	AB	0.163897	9.845965AFFX-2315057	BB	0.495399	BB	-0.360449	10.107495AFFX-2315058	AA	0.130791	AA	0.590098	12.289185AFFX-2315059	AB	0.005420	AB	0.176855	10.794460AFFX-2315063	NC	0.736990	AA	0.462236	10.278764AFFX-2315064	AB	0.129805	AB	0.210393	10.400558AFFX-2315065	BB	0.069039	BB	-0.659883	10.628733AFFX-2315066	AA	0.029059	AA	0.664014	9.967769AFFX-2315067	AB	0.091575	AB	0.121279	11.510495AFFX-2315068	BB	0.070100	BB	-0.612077	10.254347AFFX-2315069	BB	0.167307	BB	-0.874965	11.302579AFFX-2315070	BB	0.334366	BB	-0.431430	9.515330AFFX-2315071	BB	0.057569	BB	-0.756687	9.559488AFFX-2315072	BB	0.220021	BB	-0.527847	10.354416AFFX-2315073	NC	0.885489	AB	-0.134234	9.517641AFFX-2315074	BB	0.484525	BB	-0.396803	9.755479AFFX-2315075	AA	0.238381	AA	0.515637	11.648923AFFX-2315076	AA	0.287373	AA	0.466598	10.835487!sample_table_end
