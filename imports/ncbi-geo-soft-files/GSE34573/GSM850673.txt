Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried. Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station. !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850673/suppl/GSM850673.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850673/suppl/GSM850673.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	NC	0.659202	AB	-0.310659	11.182856AFFX-2315061	AA	0.013268	AA	0.775123	10.604881AFFX-2315062	AA	0.204821	AA	0.328601	10.081446AFFX-2315057	BB	0.110371	BB	-0.494213	10.327525AFFX-2315058	AA	0.146080	AA	0.582066	11.389517AFFX-2315059	AB	0.015990	AB	0.185110	10.086713AFFX-2315063	NC	0.667252	AA	0.464849	10.025556AFFX-2315064	AB	0.011089	AB	0.190122	10.736613AFFX-2315065	BB	0.085718	BB	-0.525129	10.323299AFFX-2315066	AA	0.058603	AA	0.757729	9.772428AFFX-2315067	AB	0.179377	AB	0.280016	10.903813AFFX-2315068	BB	0.326716	BB	-0.378602	9.957827AFFX-2315069	BB	0.005387	BB	-0.873139	10.587975AFFX-2315070	BB	0.474590	BB	-0.362343	9.249983AFFX-2315071	BB	0.306499	BB	-0.469792	8.635653AFFX-2315072	BB	0.093294	BB	-0.528400	10.070750AFFX-2315073	AA	0.248160	AA	0.197955	9.257782AFFX-2315074	NC	0.510835	AB	-0.351788	10.297971AFFX-2315075	AA	0.037594	AA	0.620858	11.437225AFFX-2315076	AA	0.039236	AA	0.539411	10.408397!sample_table_end
