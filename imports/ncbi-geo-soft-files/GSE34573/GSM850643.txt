Microlaser Technologies) and air dried on ice for about 1 minute. Slides were immersed for 2 minutes in cold 75% ethanol, tapped dry and stained for 30 seconds in cold haematoxylin and eosin (9:1) containing 1% NucleoGuard (AmpTec, Hamburg). Excess stain was tapped off and slides were washed in cold nuclease-free water for 30 seconds, cold 75% ethanol for 1 minute, cold 100% ethanol for 1 minute then air dried. Tumour cells for analysis were excised by laser microdissection and pressure catapulting using a PALM MicroBeam instrument and caught on PALM Adhesive Caps. A minimum of 200,000 Âµm2 of tissue was collected for each DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from microdissected cells by adding 100 Âµl of lysis buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA, 1% Tween 20, 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (Qiagen)) to the tube containing the captured cells and incubating inverted for 3hr at 55OC then 5min at 95 OC. 2 Âµl of linear polyacrylamide solution (GenElute, Sigma) were added and DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and air dried. The precipitated DNA was subject to whole genome amplification using a Genomiphi kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to Affymetrix standard protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = All arrays were washed and stained on an Affymetrix FS450 fluidics station. !Sample_scan_protocol = All arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner as per Affymetrix procedures.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype analysis was performed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console version 4.0 with the default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Wenbin,,Wei!Sample_contact_email = wenbin.wei2@durham.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Computational Biology!Sample_contact_department = Biosciences!Sample_contact_institute = Durham University!Sample_contact_address = Upper Mountjoy!Sample_contact_city = Durham!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = DH1 3LE!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850643/suppl/GSM850643.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM850nnn/GSM850643/suppl/GSM850643.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34573!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotypes#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.236782	AB	-0.253078	11.362803AFFX-2315061	AA	0.010249	AA	0.795063	11.026464AFFX-2315062	AA	0.131679	AA	0.374342	10.316057AFFX-2315057	AA	0.009229	AA	0.495494	10.208358AFFX-2315058	AA	0.029693	AA	0.643548	11.407660AFFX-2315059	BB	0.211206	BB	-0.630678	10.580170AFFX-2315063	AB	0.137231	AB	-0.378342	10.419415AFFX-2315064	AB	0.464665	AB	0.568621	11.209910AFFX-2315065	AB	0.232577	AB	0.101080	10.095507AFFX-2315066	AA	0.204861	AA	0.543352	9.901714AFFX-2315067	BB	0.018415	BB	-0.563732	10.942715AFFX-2315068	AB	0.010181	AB	0.228175	10.516335AFFX-2315069	AB	0.025791	AB	-0.163306	10.960487AFFX-2315070	BB	0.215660	BB	-0.524533	9.636832AFFX-2315071	AA	0.038517	AA	0.602001	9.113169AFFX-2315072	AB	0.311623	AB	-0.250632	10.211615AFFX-2315073	AA	0.050297	AA	0.662550	10.003470AFFX-2315074	AA	0.015968	AA	0.793115	10.283008AFFX-2315075	AA	0.106005	AA	0.571233	11.541354AFFX-2315076	BB	0.013723	BB	-0.564099	10.332882!sample_table_end
