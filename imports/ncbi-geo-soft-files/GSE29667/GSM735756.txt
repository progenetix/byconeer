Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735756/suppl/GSM735756.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735756/suppl/GSM735756.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.000546	AB	3205.088379	2391.502686SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.079301	BB	532.578308	1131.742676SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.006500	BB	603.338623	2044.386108SNP_A-4263484	NC	0.404909	AA	2350.065186	947.714294SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.014938	AA	2254.701172	446.672455SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.003766	AB	1408.518555	955.882202SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.013726	AB	741.912598	466.467621SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.030299	AA	2903.123535	1387.614868SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.426319	AA	1114.133057	2965.792236SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.001566	BB	792.300171	2169.286133SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.006538	BB	576.385254	1525.262939SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.001433	AB	1229.886719	2414.974609SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.043263	AB	1281.146729	594.309937SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.011732	AB	412.234131	523.894897SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.081826	BB	506.924774	567.518860SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.001656	AB	1497.052612	2218.803955SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.005123	AB	2939.899414	2385.449463SNP_A-2000337	NC	0.382597	AB	801.174927	1445.395142SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.411172	AB	1449.641479	2080.716553SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.143005	AA	387.638824	281.926361!sample_table_end
