Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735770/suppl/GSM735770.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735770/suppl/GSM735770.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.001366	AB	2403.058105	1936.082031SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.500704	AB	973.045227	925.540771SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.036124	AB	1481.984009	3173.281982SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.000259	AB	1782.323608	1460.387085SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.000408	AB	1105.891968	964.492004SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.020276	AB	4313.180176	2140.621582SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.063943	AB	1124.719360	859.409424SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.002513	AB	1227.848511	1091.873779SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.230262	AA	4130.351074	3089.318115SNP_A-1995832	NC	0.381780	AA	2541.347656	2330.157959SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.017756	BB	1952.185913	3625.883545SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.012306	AB	2351.272705	3142.614014SNP_A-1997709	BB	0.004464	BB	1313.103516	1886.659302SNP_A-1997896	BB	0.017543	BB	1035.967285	1992.260254SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.012104	AB	957.407898	1289.023926SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.001811	AB	1471.205322	2223.045898SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.005430	AB	1419.403320	1453.028320SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.034996	AB	554.369385	1009.453979SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.415276	AA	2429.100830	1860.981445SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.079975	AA	790.547913	335.577393!sample_table_end
