Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735753/suppl/GSM735753.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735753/suppl/GSM735753.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.021346	BB	5210.427734	5787.955566SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.146493	BB	542.736511	718.728027SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.030759	BB	666.198120	1256.164429SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.007216	BB	1816.237915	3654.425537SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.005605	AB	709.123901	722.617371SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.005269	AB	740.919373	763.209290SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.068079	BB	485.915619	747.372925SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.013728	AA	5291.015625	2704.435059SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.169385	BB	3540.077881	8521.008789SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.046158	BB	1695.099487	3195.712402SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.002855	BB	852.175964	1765.067749SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.006388	AB	1672.776123	1942.754272SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.003927	AB	570.455688	549.665161SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.003359	AB	1054.103882	1134.546387SNP_A-1997922	NC	0.165589	BB	535.826172	570.455688SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.005605	AB	1910.399780	1634.229126SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.015106	AA	4741.240234	1450.175293SNP_A-2000337	NC	0.244574	AA	1114.982056	468.023193SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.069619	AA	1918.941895	1292.973145SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.137580	AA	411.601715	287.466400!sample_table_end
