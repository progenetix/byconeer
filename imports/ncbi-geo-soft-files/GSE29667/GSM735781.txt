Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735781/suppl/GSM735781.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735781/suppl/GSM735781.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.026052	AB	7271.498535	5567.937988SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.741172	BB	1390.689087	3174.898438SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.042426	BB	669.421814	1125.868896SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.005323	AB	2638.328857	2377.549072SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.005985	AB	731.731201	697.422180SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.032344	AA	2078.111572	801.269775SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.002557	BB	604.513916	1364.401611SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.032119	AA	7043.834961	2879.227539SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.321362	AA	4833.643066	6057.812500SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.005127	BB	1212.390991	2546.774170SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.002546	BB	964.869446	1753.695679SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.006919	AB	1815.109375	2084.442871SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.007974	AB	695.367004	505.744934SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.008356	AB	617.539062	941.348083SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.043345	BB	444.385773	469.142426SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.003649	AB	1226.188599	1685.751587SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.004049	AA	3724.533936	1677.690430SNP_A-2000337	NC	0.116971	AB	608.782959	537.895081SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.041439	AA	1792.442017	1056.705566SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.153969	AA	342.545563	298.914734!sample_table_end
