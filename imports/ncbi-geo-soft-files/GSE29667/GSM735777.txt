Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735777/suppl/GSM735777.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735777/suppl/GSM735777.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.006987	AB	4349.048340	3568.638672SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.510079	BB	765.467834	684.972473SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.027130	AB	1058.855225	724.934814SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.047654	AB	806.369934	972.928955SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.009390	AA	1722.862793	688.679138SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.012762	AB	239.084671	896.474670SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.009225	BB	663.584900	1232.923950SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.035563	AB	5803.619629	5563.381836SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.219163	AA	1511.691650	1917.399170SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.004293	AB	1722.862793	1972.574463SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.006033	BB	571.700745	2062.572998SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.009667	AB	806.369934	2624.826660SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.002087	AB	724.934814	646.023010SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.007902	AB	1162.718384	1320.794312SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.088676	AB	608.217224	328.151550SNP_A-2000230	BB	0.004706	BB	310.623291	4809.111816SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.003485	AB	1721.163940	1732.302612SNP_A-2000337	NC	0.330338	AB	888.814392	583.828735SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.032122	AA	1454.796265	806.369934SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.226615	AA	471.779388	1232.923950!sample_table_end
