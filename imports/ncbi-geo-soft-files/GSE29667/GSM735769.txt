Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735769/suppl/GSM735769.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735769/suppl/GSM735769.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.005761	BB	1063.062012	2648.759033SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.508124	BB	1100.893799	1941.279053SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.007738	BB	1422.126465	5238.263184SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.002276	AB	1532.035645	1018.622253SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.003343	AA	1932.100098	496.515198SNP_A-4264431	NC	0.246468	AB	1279.359009	666.568542SNP_A-1980898	NC	0.588132	AB	551.364441	581.617126SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.012783	AA	1885.910767	518.600586SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.220119	AA	1345.457886	1115.302246SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.025354	AB	1963.945923	1734.999512SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.007966	BB	448.194214	1746.050903SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.009517	AB	701.831726	1339.450317SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.026443	AA	3634.511475	624.732483SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.081588	AB	1024.397461	791.438721SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.006068	BB	417.074310	707.640442SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.046257	AB	2230.020264	1518.148804SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.005177	AA	3768.148682	983.477295SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.001843	AA	1713.792236	549.048645SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.022374	AA	3907.368652	1038.138672SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.151968	AA	2078.133057	410.878662!sample_table_end
