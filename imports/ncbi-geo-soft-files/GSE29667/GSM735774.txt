Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735774/suppl/GSM735774.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735774/suppl/GSM735774.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.072674	AB	1620.344116	932.936462SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.776176	BB	891.955139	891.955139SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.001914	AB	1363.094238	1213.599365SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.002213	AB	1383.267700	1021.981384SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.064798	AB	1247.637085	727.704712SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.001947	AB	1681.353149	1327.006958SNP_A-1980898	NC	0.129096	AB	675.637024	723.773376SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.038984	AB	961.957520	589.149963SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.750117	AB	8493.699219	7451.809082SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.020965	AA	2645.036377	2042.398193SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.002125	BB	1302.207642	2602.392334SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.006579	AB	671.226379	1739.613525SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.006327	AB	671.226379	851.229675SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.005555	AB	918.701904	946.580200SNP_A-1997922	NC	0.494149	BB	492.236420	269.605042SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.009795	AB	530.437317	1967.444214SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.006899	AB	1287.539551	1776.355835SNP_A-2000337	BB	0.045349	BB	645.565247	1763.372803SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.169004	AA	1049.222046	1463.929932SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.136281	AA	438.363953	519.218140!sample_table_end
