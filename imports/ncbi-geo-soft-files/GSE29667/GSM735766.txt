Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735766/suppl/GSM735766.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735766/suppl/GSM735766.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	NC	0.171377	BB	1070.237427	2176.751709SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.071214	BB	546.476562	1271.869995SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.017541	BB	1056.150146	3019.614746SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.012863	AB	1080.079590	1180.211182SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.015062	AA	1565.498657	651.785095SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.023492	AA	5666.823730	1705.798950SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.001645	BB	469.684906	1191.783813SNP_A-1983139	NC	0.430044	AB	608.711426	1685.702271SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.458698	AA	5069.502930	1009.505981SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.002723	BB	713.183716	2145.045166SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.005141	BB	1127.716797	2943.761963SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.012072	AB	604.417053	2460.332520SNP_A-1997709	NC	0.701710	AB	976.714355	412.969177SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.005390	AA	1482.223633	612.550049SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.002531	BB	521.181458	1044.102295SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.013017	AA	5238.263184	1740.230469SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.005124	AB	3635.866699	3246.626709SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.004513	AA	1729.371460	668.556702SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.030825	AA	3808.599121	1186.004883SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.148888	AA	2055.985840	303.159943!sample_table_end
