Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735773/suppl/GSM735773.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735773/suppl/GSM735773.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.054041	AA	5783.187012	2588.418701SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.732218	AB	1462.236450	2011.397705SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.095595	BB	660.029480	740.638855SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.016007	BB	1595.499878	2731.978271SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.003112	AB	1391.029053	1050.266968SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.007966	AB	2959.795166	1518.516113SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.006658	BB	763.981506	1545.931274SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.066733	AB	2364.784424	1483.899780SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.286603	AA	3156.931641	4569.594727SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.019569	AB	1242.902466	1224.923950SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.002390	BB	1218.514282	1918.003296SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.008140	AB	2096.379883	3090.136963SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.000300	AB	1081.649414	782.569031SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.011710	AB	1260.121094	1224.619507SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.012437	BB	779.552185	1697.471436SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.003668	AB	1279.915649	2358.576416SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.036486	AB	5664.737793	4564.696777SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.023647	AA	1932.598633	1061.588013SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.347095	AA	4113.573730	1911.786743SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.154329	AA	341.952911	249.623428!sample_table_end
