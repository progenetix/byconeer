Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735776/suppl/GSM735776.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735776/suppl/GSM735776.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	NC	0.220628	AB	3232.407471	1635.688721SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.044634	BB	466.824951	1627.276978SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004636	BB	713.081238	2381.551758SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.001426	AB	1504.280762	1200.053589SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.032598	AA	1401.852173	610.916931SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.016003	AB	3204.529785	2167.773438SNP_A-1980898	NC	0.204398	BB	629.912109	928.193237SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.001962	AB	1570.716919	1693.602905SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.233955	AA	4207.341797	3036.406006SNP_A-1995832	NC	0.121331	AB	2176.093994	1921.795532SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.032902	BB	2255.145264	4060.884766SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.019572	AB	2209.342285	3792.649414SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.007462	AB	1693.602905	1135.588867SNP_A-1997896	BB	0.024928	BB	503.833618	1627.276978SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.016963	BB	444.020844	593.174133SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.005632	AB	988.117676	2255.145264SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.027004	AB	2424.063721	1463.300171SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.029142	AB	1200.053589	1229.233765SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.607790	AB	2300.012695	2067.527588SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.133240	AA	433.031525	354.921265!sample_table_end
