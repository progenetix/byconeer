Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735754/suppl/GSM735754.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735754/suppl/GSM735754.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.007222	AA	4799.488770	905.923401SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.113342	BB	510.984772	799.499512SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.055862	BB	1001.371094	2385.880615SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.003083	AB	2137.208984	1577.613647SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.007985	AB	569.144409	900.229004SNP_A-4264431	BB	0.000717	BB	792.124084	2013.383545SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.014609	BB	222.770905	453.815521SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.000856	AA	3086.555176	1110.279175SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.580964	AA	779.798828	3068.324219SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.002664	BB	1074.527222	2334.395752SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.010444	BB	1026.684937	3261.176025SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.005795	AB	935.647827	2515.825195SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.001639	AA	1974.404175	453.815521SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.011117	AB	616.396729	635.172363SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.006633	BB	453.815521	738.378662SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.035388	AB	1747.527954	1046.312866SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.050032	AA	2501.182129	1108.052979SNP_A-2000337	NC	0.721430	AB	1055.824829	628.642944SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.025715	AA	2612.289551	963.888245SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.074873	AA	1031.677612	306.767670!sample_table_end
