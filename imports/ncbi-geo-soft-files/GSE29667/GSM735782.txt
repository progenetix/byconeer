Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735782/suppl/GSM735782.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735782/suppl/GSM735782.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.001917	AA	5579.116211	1855.167847SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.113665	BB	916.979126	2334.906006SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.065753	BB	790.896118	1422.781982SNP_A-4263484	AA	0.009751	AA	2983.423096	1378.797974SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.000817	AB	1179.562012	986.250244SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.009616	AB	2861.421875	1949.688232SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.012894	BB	596.975952	1983.007812SNP_A-1983139	BB	0.005043	BB	1679.498413	3158.506104SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.212430	AA	3152.786133	2119.721191SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.012589	AB	2114.093750	2371.411377SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.013259	BB	1433.521362	3606.463135SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.003894	AB	1264.418823	2723.301514SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.042599	AB	1058.565796	1116.610474SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.032759	AA	3050.556641	1491.179932SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.036440	BB	978.602417	2110.419678SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.003898	AB	1339.750488	2454.330811SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.003866	AA	3840.746582	1750.466309SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.048747	AB	450.964539	981.937805SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.040230	AA	1334.008545	930.771851SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.119286	AA	503.201508	282.269257!sample_table_end
