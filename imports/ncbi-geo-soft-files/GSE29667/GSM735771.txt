Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735771/suppl/GSM735771.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735771/suppl/GSM735771.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.031219	AA	3938.301270	1467.967529SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.089614	BB	640.416199	1378.340942SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.002507	BB	1185.260132	4581.477051SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.010717	BB	1056.993774	3488.060547SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.007496	AB	738.686584	653.077454SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.001343	AA	3074.788086	828.489319SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.014578	BB	441.120453	808.080994SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.004124	AB	3106.274902	2916.825439SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.261393	AA	3725.453857	1316.443726SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.021614	AB	1448.853271	1745.127441SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.001487	BB	932.501465	1999.136719SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.006119	AB	1194.255737	1595.089233SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.026807	AB	1246.710693	600.642456SNP_A-1997896	NC	0.183707	AB	1279.402954	988.695129SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.087785	BB	701.919556	1111.141479SNP_A-2000230	NC	0.469149	AB	2632.722412	1513.449463SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.007834	AB	1229.809570	1168.499634SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.023280	AB	329.060486	723.923462SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.053877	AA	1091.718872	1031.280884SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.144345	AA	391.524139	449.072113!sample_table_end
