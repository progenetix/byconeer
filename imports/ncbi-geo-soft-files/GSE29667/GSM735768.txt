Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735768/suppl/GSM735768.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735768/suppl/GSM735768.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.012814	AB	6599.040527	4263.730957SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.380922	BB	1352.295776	5057.643066SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.025871	AB	3182.578613	6948.313965SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.019640	BB	2458.470703	4575.958496SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.003141	AB	1205.906982	879.519836SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.011478	AA	4614.464844	1452.955200SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.062815	BB	1260.029907	3345.199951SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.003315	AB	793.070801	906.759216SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.695216	BB	2509.955566	5662.582031SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.005572	AB	1352.295776	1233.156250SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.002329	BB	1370.562988	2238.708740SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.003539	AB	1814.563721	2642.121582SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.003368	AB	692.971924	768.701355SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.041050	AB	1331.029419	1174.288696SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.010843	BB	456.870972	678.994202SNP_A-2000230	NC	0.115516	AB	3131.092041	2031.261719SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.004491	AB	1754.206665	2178.498291SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.049876	AB	956.815247	878.519104SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.160526	AA	1557.736938	1518.451904SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.303588	AA	2577.079346	608.925781!sample_table_end
