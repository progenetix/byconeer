Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735755/suppl/GSM735755.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735755/suppl/GSM735755.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	NC	0.770452	AA	2566.764648	1103.217651SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.077604	BB	873.056580	2696.309326SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.004256	AB	1277.043091	1344.421143SNP_A-4263484	AA	0.003118	AA	3108.096924	1201.218994SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.003278	AB	1123.083618	1164.458374SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.005855	AA	4037.504395	1139.522217SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.019256	AB	1062.249268	1374.354126SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.001701	AB	2662.932861	2373.241943SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.225151	AA	1204.293579	1551.043213SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.014427	AB	1245.693970	420.561249SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.001984	BB	1089.801270	2556.099365SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.008678	AB	1924.875732	3269.197754SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.003281	AA	1622.712524	368.955963SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.066785	AB	1355.289551	1665.120117SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.005282	BB	451.344940	1056.343018SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.038924	AB	2200.140625	3854.111328SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.015796	AB	4627.816406	4463.562500SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.080497	AA	1220.418701	386.933655SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.364543	AB	5322.757324	2289.625732SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.076263	AA	1001.449829	574.173828!sample_table_end
