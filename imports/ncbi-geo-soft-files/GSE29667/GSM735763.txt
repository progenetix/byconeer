Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735763/suppl/GSM735763.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735763/suppl/GSM735763.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.021873	AB	1924.122681	1252.042236SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.353650	BB	1009.250610	1787.615234SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.065739	BB	720.577942	1137.403931SNP_A-4263484	NC	0.528072	AB	1556.697144	2242.994873SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.005505	AB	1409.920044	934.033936SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.016862	AB	3939.887695	1909.599121SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.003076	AB	963.758606	909.549011SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.017778	AA	3455.309814	1720.584961SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.629876	AA	7726.635254	5821.435547SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.001978	AB	1543.616821	1332.135376SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.002946	BB	1211.951782	1835.989868SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.002146	AB	1483.300659	2130.259277SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.006057	AB	824.554504	904.602112SNP_A-1997896	BB	0.003614	BB	1008.919067	2355.932129SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.041479	BB	459.149963	515.931702SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.004049	AB	1224.099976	1614.271362SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.050289	AA	6755.269531	4153.486328SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.050177	AA	3240.608398	1191.392822SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.142225	AB	6946.795410	2920.571777SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.085695	AA	741.593567	416.546570!sample_table_end
