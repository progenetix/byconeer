Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735758/suppl/GSM735758.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735758/suppl/GSM735758.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	NC	0.277519	AA	2329.935303	818.132568SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.253158	BB	784.005188	1140.464966SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004929	BB	945.388977	3002.239502SNP_A-4263484	NC	0.474384	AB	1051.125854	1550.171875SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.003081	AB	1367.077515	1164.021118SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.011630	AB	2431.209229	1236.424561SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.033474	BB	603.818298	1023.437073SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.004274	AB	941.589844	840.457275SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.206094	AA	2856.500977	2321.281250SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.004183	AB	1680.944580	1904.902832SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.001668	BB	1216.616821	2028.350220SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.003106	AB	994.806030	1889.638306SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.005143	AB	1257.554688	1014.022522SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.095357	AA	1915.252441	1404.946899SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.014300	BB	597.119202	1694.432007SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.001246	AB	1927.640625	2366.618652SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.008075	AA	3617.033936	1780.505127SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.017980	AB	795.527710	1058.477295SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.054124	AA	1328.574097	1087.630737SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.153706	AA	348.966309	409.673004!sample_table_end
