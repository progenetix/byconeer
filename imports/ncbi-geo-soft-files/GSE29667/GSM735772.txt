Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735772/suppl/GSM735772.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735772/suppl/GSM735772.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.086471	AA	2770.099121	903.861328SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.136934	BB	403.946869	395.073639SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.095782	BB	1580.879272	4984.217773SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.002265	AB	1449.106323	988.674744SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.036907	AA	2914.441650	879.825806SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.011604	AA	1286.211792	423.573303SNP_A-1980898	NC	0.271986	BB	412.462250	405.410065SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.010213	AB	391.733734	374.651520SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.238607	AA	783.953613	460.302216SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.006780	BB	902.836853	3043.537842SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.012794	BB	847.058289	3220.449219SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.004663	BB	1021.765381	4932.367676SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.001491	AA	2161.279297	453.414124SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.004352	AB	648.154907	856.441528SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.006115	AB	749.019470	419.953918SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.007503	AB	842.302002	1436.994751SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.006516	AB	1201.102905	1391.487183SNP_A-2000337	NC	0.245116	AA	1148.153198	520.287109SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.038904	AA	2447.808350	1143.182251SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.094300	AA	671.018005	419.953918!sample_table_end
