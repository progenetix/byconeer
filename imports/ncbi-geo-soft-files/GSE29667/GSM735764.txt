Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735764/suppl/GSM735764.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735764/suppl/GSM735764.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.006896	AA	6367.251465	1696.691895SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.049403	BB	370.836578	1183.350830SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.007189	AB	1802.608765	1927.083252SNP_A-4263484	AA	0.006163	AA	4463.721680	2575.462646SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.012693	AB	1008.529236	1347.571411SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.018997	AA	3371.011719	501.595459SNP_A-1980898	NC	0.125114	BB	383.286743	454.191193SNP_A-1983139	BB	0.005107	BB	1481.744873	3799.493896SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.214639	AA	2988.630127	1766.858887SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.008319	BB	914.625549	1793.425415SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.006566	BB	975.133911	2943.391357SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.001196	AB	1525.442871	2344.892578SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.048114	AB	1449.514160	636.145386SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.005795	AB	1074.463013	1097.200562SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.008073	BB	412.100800	1058.714355SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.001342	AB	2045.791382	2337.526855SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.000894	BB	1556.078247	4367.316895SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.004601	AA	1864.878418	741.168396SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.182780	AA	4827.916504	1767.973145SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.138925	AA	405.528107	307.902435!sample_table_end
