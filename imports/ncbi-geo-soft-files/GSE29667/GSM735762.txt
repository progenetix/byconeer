Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735762/suppl/GSM735762.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735762/suppl/GSM735762.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.016915	AA	8014.677734	2185.721680SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.119077	BB	393.139587	460.231934SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.004743	AB	1626.181396	1485.966431SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.002194	AB	1494.823242	1012.463745SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.002365	AB	1181.943481	898.167175SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.010613	AA	2987.296143	1087.659668SNP_A-1980898	NC	0.581254	AB	1048.157593	582.186646SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.003262	AB	1076.037598	1349.917969SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.318596	BB	4884.363281	8648.821289SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.005397	AA	2897.400635	1975.825195SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.008882	BB	1768.253174	3038.923584SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.003566	AB	928.400269	1879.953857SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.026888	AB	670.180969	965.565613SNP_A-1997896	BB	0.004144	BB	1136.958374	2397.406006SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.042470	BB	670.180969	1087.839844SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.003542	AB	1153.641235	1832.634521SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.006714	AB	1919.492065	1518.678101SNP_A-2000337	NC	0.107404	AB	809.471130	688.349304SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.247660	AA	1414.122070	1626.181396SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.101585	AA	729.781555	791.564941!sample_table_end
