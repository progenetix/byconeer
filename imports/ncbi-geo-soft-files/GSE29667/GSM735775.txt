Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735775/suppl/GSM735775.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735775/suppl/GSM735775.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.005800	AA	6818.811035	2107.892090SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.208047	BB	629.749329	758.067139SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.038154	BB	505.166656	629.749329SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.002221	BB	861.476074	2102.990723SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.001699	AB	1009.600281	870.456909SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.002755	AB	1088.656006	966.329773SNP_A-1980898	NC	0.653320	BB	551.683167	648.960632SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.016227	AB	5071.124512	3786.455078SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.737992	AA	6887.128906	2521.804932SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.003213	AA	2748.405762	1689.277954SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.002268	BB	874.475403	1869.474731SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.004560	AB	1801.069336	2301.032227SNP_A-1997709	NC	0.336534	AB	2089.809570	748.761047SNP_A-1997896	NC	0.123004	AB	999.862122	725.344421SNP_A-1997922	NC	0.109721	BB	542.792664	639.367615SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.005431	AB	904.356873	1978.542725SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.004696	AB	3571.620361	3202.481689SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.045146	AB	1021.257812	931.995422SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.146050	AA	1051.711670	1417.558594SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.170359	AA	285.329285	375.088135!sample_table_end
