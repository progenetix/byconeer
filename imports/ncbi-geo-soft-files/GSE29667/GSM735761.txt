Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735761/suppl/GSM735761.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735761/suppl/GSM735761.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	NC	0.102447	AA	2389.137939	693.154297SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.121720	BB	425.558960	525.436401SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.019428	BB	600.459778	1264.100830SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.005317	AB	986.607544	681.333923SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.013755	AA	1779.101685	732.970642SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.005657	AA	1391.551758	378.580322SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.003841	AB	1015.343018	1035.860229SNP_A-1983139	NC	0.120240	AB	1039.732422	535.679565SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.205668	AA	2315.563965	2000.499512SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.015576	AB	1859.113892	2544.997559SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.003688	BB	1492.756714	2641.654785SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.012812	AB	1023.600525	1169.143921SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.037033	AB	3244.732666	1414.216919SNP_A-1997896	BB	0.002801	BB	819.874695	2139.049561SNP_A-1997922	NC	0.167196	BB	486.156067	410.216003SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.012283	AB	937.183533	949.478088SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.001559	AB	2292.472900	2153.053223SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.072941	AB	458.894073	547.043396SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.035374	AA	1108.687378	753.094788SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.041021	AB	2547.878418	7479.475586!sample_table_end
