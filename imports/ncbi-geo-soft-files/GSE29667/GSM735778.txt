Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735778/suppl/GSM735778.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735778/suppl/GSM735778.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	NC	0.481113	AB	1958.316284	842.242737SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.197004	BB	533.494629	511.048645SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.010930	BB	506.556427	1458.993408SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.011811	AB	2104.568115	2545.246826SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.010557	AA	1792.564941	720.168396SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.002608	AA	2988.211426	928.262390SNP_A-1980898	NC	0.184761	BB	454.111755	570.820129SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.004605	AB	963.163086	1375.060181SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.210367	AA	2491.581299	2841.149170SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.084256	AB	1659.693726	2431.909180SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.001364	BB	1146.982178	2496.651123SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.000410	AB	1308.366943	2239.187256SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.001092	AB	1246.952637	763.166321SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.007143	AB	512.689514	794.596008SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.052747	AB	690.323730	599.777283SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.005602	AB	911.822754	2088.397949SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.005438	AB	3051.403320	2472.308105SNP_A-2000337	NC	0.220548	AB	842.242737	607.552490SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.050238	AA	2736.451172	1280.279175SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.132890	AA	1814.675049	810.436218!sample_table_end
