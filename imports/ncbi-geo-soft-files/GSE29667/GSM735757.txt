Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735757/suppl/GSM735757.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735757/suppl/GSM735757.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.003387	AB	1690.735474	1606.513062SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.045281	BB	410.510223	1422.490967SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.006903	BB	565.121277	2436.371826SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.015661	AB	2904.674316	2273.605225SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.003672	AA	1816.283447	436.781219SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.002960	AA	2245.681152	447.647614SNP_A-1980898	NC	0.640595	BB	681.500854	936.129456SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.033162	AB	902.687927	565.121277SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.240649	AA	2831.771484	772.388794SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.018479	BB	1565.892456	4201.525391SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.003546	BB	727.262451	1911.346680SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.007195	AB	653.117065	1643.133179SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.010425	AB	380.899078	419.271790SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.011348	AB	596.801025	618.971252SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.008832	AB	744.919434	589.593506SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.005108	AA	3465.330566	1240.312134SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.019863	AB	4531.583496	4693.440918SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.002263	AA	1679.383301	428.166168SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.094832	AA	4270.648926	1576.150269SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.096520	AA	1535.204346	593.816406!sample_table_end
