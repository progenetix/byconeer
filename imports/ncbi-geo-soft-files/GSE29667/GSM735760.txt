Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735760/suppl/GSM735760.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735760/suppl/GSM735760.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.001929	AB	3283.471436	2228.771484SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.065868	BB	592.520386	1507.257324SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.013406	BB	523.046631	1304.297607SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.025088	AB	3703.133301	3780.498535SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.006920	AB	1119.084961	1274.467163SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.008885	AB	2523.488525	1841.367065SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.022457	AB	1156.965698	1014.201050SNP_A-1983139	NC	0.171134	AA	3418.438477	1897.811523SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.222324	AA	3889.705566	3491.179932SNP_A-1995832	NC	0.106829	AB	1785.744385	1048.614014SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.003263	BB	1432.905884	2679.449707SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.002348	AB	1043.507568	2232.661377SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.027469	AB	453.899872	382.847443SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.007822	AA	2343.083984	1089.249512SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.034341	AB	1390.537354	1691.585327SNP_A-2000230	NC	0.446670	AB	3022.513428	1819.091797SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.001346	AB	2561.229736	2359.906738SNP_A-2000337	NC	0.532232	AA	1228.997559	737.105469SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.064784	AA	2905.389404	1383.736572SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.097515	AA	1588.184204	485.292480!sample_table_end
