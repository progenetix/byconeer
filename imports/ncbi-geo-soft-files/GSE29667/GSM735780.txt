Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735780/suppl/GSM735780.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735780/suppl/GSM735780.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.000897	AB	3245.243408	2299.322510SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.058471	BB	486.383850	1289.158325SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.024387	BB	650.804260	1309.436523SNP_A-4263484	AA	0.004286	AA	4086.604980	2285.345703SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.018017	AB	1982.387451	1395.966187SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.002510	AB	1661.096191	1080.943970SNP_A-1980898	NC	0.732062	AA	1407.642334	1097.131470SNP_A-1983139	NC	0.115338	AA	2328.427734	1099.416992SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.596746	AA	2766.875488	5309.984375SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.015550	BB	700.081543	1251.664062SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.003363	BB	746.150513	1884.417847SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.006834	AB	1990.823242	2412.329834SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.014021	AB	1007.889221	559.737427SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.042216	AB	385.578400	953.138123SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.006717	AA	1168.625854	531.598328SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.000944	AB	2017.922241	2117.349609SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.006639	AB	1518.086548	1333.847168SNP_A-2000337	NC	0.461493	AB	943.449219	582.188538SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.048631	AA	1457.838989	1064.438721SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.077309	AA	1106.414917	220.748657!sample_table_end
