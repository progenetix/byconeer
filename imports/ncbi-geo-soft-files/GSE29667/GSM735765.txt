Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735765/suppl/GSM735765.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735765/suppl/GSM735765.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.019936	BB	5084.248047	5662.070801SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.084884	BB	476.100616	915.670837SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.041390	BB	542.278076	700.785706SNP_A-4263484	AA	0.019402	AA	5076.169434	3734.704346SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.018821	AB	456.608154	478.676971SNP_A-4264431	NC	0.172805	AB	2046.630859	968.756958SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.005089	AB	1056.291992	1049.021362SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.021609	AA	6510.273926	2718.861816SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.743924	AA	4823.519043	7389.649902SNP_A-1995832	NC	0.428921	AA	1880.673706	784.308777SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.004213	BB	910.718933	1540.387695SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.002238	AB	1479.221802	2686.771484SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.011584	AB	1622.986694	732.020264SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.017910	AB	1197.438354	1112.646118SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.024303	AB	1073.424438	778.687927SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.022410	AB	3249.955322	3605.940674SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.001608	AB	3003.899902	2902.786377SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.023578	AA	1474.494629	599.396301SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.071192	AA	4059.644287	1483.923218SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.150401	AA	357.024963	267.478180!sample_table_end
