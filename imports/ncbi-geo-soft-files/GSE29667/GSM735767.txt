Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735767/suppl/GSM735767.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735767/suppl/GSM735767.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.008144	AB	981.051453	1011.700684SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.122347	BB	503.454407	726.709839SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.096496	AB	1062.806885	1166.153931SNP_A-4263484	AA	0.001661	AA	3556.541016	1099.529541SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.013095	AB	1458.175049	871.474121SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.014289	AA	5007.833008	1438.698730SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.004116	AB	825.485413	676.316467SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.008758	AA	5279.662109	2175.986084SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.213852	AA	2980.124023	1798.222290SNP_A-1995832	NC	0.188169	AB	2007.550537	1442.955322SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.002849	BB	1265.674561	1915.968994SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.005519	AB	971.649902	2542.214844SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.014771	AB	560.398438	892.331726SNP_A-1997896	NC	0.185214	AB	1118.237793	1590.605103SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.007600	AB	743.049927	339.424011SNP_A-2000230	NC	0.355423	AB	2826.491943	1708.269287SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.011284	AA	3821.385742	2029.660645SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.003228	AA	1664.334106	560.471191SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.230962	AA	3043.041016	1758.985352SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.098368	AA	635.994202	266.020355!sample_table_end
