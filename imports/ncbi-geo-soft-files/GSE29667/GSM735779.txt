Fixative removal was performed twice in xylene and absolute ethanol washes. The pellets were digested with proteinase K and then processed according to the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue protocol (Qiagen Inc. GmbH, Germany). The concentration was determined by Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tumor DNA was hybridized on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping SNP6.0 using the Human mapping SNP6.0 assay kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, USA) and following the manufacturerâs protocol. The only modification to the manufacturerâs protocol occurred after digestion and adaptor ligation, when the DNA was split into nine plates instead of three. Independent PCR reactions were set up using TITANIUM Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Mountain View, USA), for the recommended 35 cycles. The nine PCR products were then pooled.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = CEL files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by Genotyping Console 3.0.1. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = jie,,hu!Sample_contact_institute = Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University!Sample_contact_address = 180 Fenglin Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200032!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735779/suppl/GSM735779.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM735nnn/GSM735779/suppl/GSM735779.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29667!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.009124	AB	3161.345215	2879.264404SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.078840	BB	366.152863	697.821838SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.038382	BB	1035.259766	2661.632568SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.004134	BB	1192.272095	2419.534668SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.000673	AB	1045.438599	1000.746399SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.007982	AB	914.460327	1167.757935SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.025477	BB	354.720123	601.738464SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.001701	AA	3213.150879	960.810974SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.213473	AA	1833.910645	2169.037354SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.007893	AA	2795.470947	729.231445SNP_A-1995893	NC	0.795640	AA	2689.570312	1150.038574SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.003715	AB	971.851501	2337.688721SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.016863	AA	3166.196533	757.763000SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.011627	AB	442.973267	534.735474SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.020196	BB	422.257599	518.171143SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.005523	AB	1587.329712	1458.800659SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.001085	AB	2209.824951	2209.855957SNP_A-2000337	NC	0.244199	AA	1103.639526	448.466949SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.032863	AA	2879.264404	1131.311279SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.092396	AA	682.370483	251.890335!sample_table_end
