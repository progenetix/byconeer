DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM407nnn/GSM407040/suppl/GSM407040_NN536.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM407nnn/GSM407040/suppl/GSM407040_NN537.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16598!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2361.1315058118375	2949.6587690604183	2498.3763131379578	2741.140818569047	1.2553483581403861	1.443368623595777	0.86973510274389398	-0.1926	0.875020132578781862	3076.8500936739247	2888.94808704044	3221.4247881153233	2686.6003328911261	1.6918056887443376	1.5252318626012522	1.1092121337269976	0.1757	1.1295024617882773	1828.6042640672529	1574.3332663195049	1953.2547993826365	1497.5570605259431	1.0973403925731802	0.88952020325989012	1.2336317809889827	0.2313	1.17391197472408474	8601.3231357855566	7895.5095598552707	8416.8650481560398	7254.2413659646381	3.5694971538485079	3.1000163061140795	1.1514446381486714	-0.0120	0.991727427486022275	10097.751823041135	9543.8863113980187	9826.6251052178541	8763.2295666456157	6.6084510671910195	5.9964678071972237	1.102057291003758	0.2507	1.18979884614415226	5687.7792695614662	6234.5002356463556	5717.7966875840848	5744.8880434242401	3.0649174429271633	3.1425485280261376	0.975296774447033	0.0684	1.04857271377659147	1671.8946577377446	1912.5748132818831	1790.4191787907296	1799.8087976631737	0.67253238953646854	0.69145545531739805	0.97263299373024226	0.2008	1.14936775426457398	2136.2271088249877	1965.4742512406726	2269.6125677091341	1851.7019248719548	1.0625855509859365	0.88538195109320694	1.2001436777358419	0.2143	1.16010520445758469	2680.6636839500252	3760.0477110844704	2824.2330278694326	3481.3604409986392	1.827388663774123	2.2443809072462431	0.81420611709633939	-0.2002	0.8704050268869408810	6350.2396777768909	8474.7473645356404	6332.2539844470039	7783.4182990211575	2.9111738035398171	3.6841819119890182	0.79018188381695043	-0.1591	0.8955691045681111211	8536.4803889142495	12264.224985409654	8362.63186481907	11240.709123009483	4.389046009259518	5.7066141300202151	0.76911561028290021	-0.2664	0.8313781217067833812	5512.1617067027728	4569.1817319128513	5558.6565194463155	4223.8261864207425	2.7473860146731623	2.0286929909884241	1.3542640640438033	0.1668	1.122551101357779113	2568.7061866819467	2947.5698903106909	2709.9323237420499	2741.2156497943934	1.3492795109540012	1.401296930443237	0.96287908839364789	-0.0329	0.9774788440654206314	8302.309185649061	8254.7891308408598	8191.2814843502101	7583.6700488673105	3.3658126991458701	3.0818491203513063	1.0921406492353509	0.1632	1.119803495226407315	2211.6504146841326	2482.115362898789	2349.0461839493669	2315.4057064490585	1.1736767571143802	1.2321081489731016	0.95257608521831372	0.0322	1.022573608523177816	1308.2690723083233	2140.0695969598828	1399.4467103111863	2011.88213353486	0.74678111416219906	1.0556870541994237	0.7073887201624518	-0.2241	0.8561156635061903917	454.84165483427643	519.5121444108164	465.02211154622819	528.72854312279594	0.36588997989028627	0.39051105795511321	0.93695164947760057	0.0216	1.015070213137725618	2729.8733670667739	3840.0654282333494	2860.8917329119722	3562.6327291094758	1.4515179250644139	1.7283507995995679	0.83982830649929863	0.0122	1.008506932552370819	1666.4897914706396	1985.1356373139222	1783.0091654782848	1870.5354615590877	0.83102051788277953	0.90760685384126305	0.91561727896352119	-0.0224	0.9846004244499062520	1204.1080169831378	1456.4748245225774	1297.1285735385804	1390.0920924889338	0.65750026620930357	0.73337884887247307	0.89653562714573998	-0.4417	0.73627598009165296!sample_table_end
