DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM407nnn/GSM407053/suppl/GSM407053_NN540.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM407nnn/GSM407053/suppl/GSM407053_NN541.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16598!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2218.9684731720495	1600.868793916653	2218.4078237683325	1611.7860951055991	1.1358301618375495	0.89075582167663625	1.2751307756817341	0.2687	1.20469715980715472	6974.1042826082421	2799.9483961229716	6451.434393680679	2744.3214756708039	3.1146513503533102	1.4502328485154687	2.1476905267603232	0.7843	1.72224667745590153	1974.5244823741191	1489.0452528732101	1996.315258747597	1483.8692859339094	1.0390766933643527	0.82495795903149582	1.2595510861962389	0.3787	1.3002117915787854	7563.5524672338452	6947.6371292946124	6985.1134420976405	6733.1113951164707	3.7664012083174963	3.6246064879246482	1.0391200316131519	-0.2129	0.862795342500291775	9875.3067389481057	12349.036188139498	9063.4488588297772	11612.587557387656	4.3153239154533276	5.6357199521028027	0.76570943058361018	-0.2712	0.828624318838455446	4026.7994966774668	3647.2957392229118	3873.2114370123927	3577.6975584690172	2.2388152471658485	2.2797452332956052	0.98204624554885522	-0.1036	0.930712588643873077	1158.0889899502279	1094.6830661901672	1203.6986588314976	1115.219054062492	0.50288664873620093	0.484705302610976	1.0375101036181922	0.3011	1.2320553471985568	1242.2189231384107	1149.8288323433105	1286.7636231138404	1166.6337306139246	0.66873797031094862	0.68796830884076687	0.97204763899339863	-0.0761	0.948599052003210939	2750.0564436954869	3510.1021277930349	2720.6379407082118	3438.0784658933326	1.35546636316044	1.7013020771295524	0.79672292262605782	-0.3008	0.811776964212970310	5024.2007715815553	7112.0022771086233	4754.9325051596406	6896.834621736064	2.5386242005398363	3.9452296368788304	0.6434667773985917	-0.2483	0.8418754529934132611	8909.1601187354408	13679.423219935034	8180.2781284658067	12827.44736746048	3.5758545427653479	5.4946978645622337	0.6507827420007265	-0.4965	0.7088303235167621212	5755.2055345409608	2701.4281791171265	5402.0107767823611	2678.2434806682359	2.8396083119779134	1.4591517896534434	1.9460677991919779	0.5826	1.497571109492420713	1507.7539266242468	1570.7154523206302	1549.4969382013021	1561.758888732345	0.96993110693123064	1.14798464876873	0.84489902192640753	0.0298	1.0208761557938314	6971.3382226418453	5837.9812980634006	6485.9685665768966	5687.0393818565381	3.4253902059084655	3.2990825496260205	1.038285691364941	0.3840	1.304983827632271415	2276.9529620183889	1982.4815248856801	2279.0782749009777	1966.8254269543934	1.2394707653689232	1.1530241940158266	1.07497377054337	0.2752	1.210140072104763316	1634.8829840351568	1957.2746165765625	1669.373301723947	1933.7476840488227	0.80014804703384623	0.89635836276120739	0.89266534488395033	0.2156	1.161215555404795817	589.17237435320669	577.41874474920769	620.24585402389619	621.38178368553667	0.26488517249792726	0.24376063810034673	1.0866609743156499	0.2213	1.165749446050025718	3276.5394745934609	3179.5922444546272	3196.2704917898268	3117.5769733794741	1.6951601073360278	1.6761474401279914	1.0113430756464867	0.1908	1.141364050833480119	1534.7658662421009	1606.0400449088158	1571.2513270470449	1595.6367205414724	0.79112254304171525	0.86977828063887042	0.90956805964460186	0.0678	1.048097073177325620	1681.3674575227355	1674.7884094683009	1716.4756813943309	1669.1971917612452	0.77210010082991765	0.7554762109334423	1.0220045180190853	-0.2832	0.82174845137484132!sample_table_end
