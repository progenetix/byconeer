Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM406nnn/GSM406540/suppl/GSM406540_NN534.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM406nnn/GSM406540/suppl/GSM406540_NN535.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16598!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F532.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2231.2615711578642	2770.3301660482048	2534.2721213153091	2394.4810764447252	1.0541971016629132	1.4163332305076946	1.3608280910404624	-0.1027	0.931316093147122052	2679.9709755849976	3258.9878228077482	3023.4366513866357	2805.7386891701403	1.0792132615051857	1.5882634334780958	1.5189959750877609	0.0829	1.05913679116095223	1429.8275564971204	1744.5717282409555	1648.0148120166755	1524.3865899965569	1.071848463626766	0.85486402056427491	0.83253294036685843	-0.2103	0.864342801731692644	6020.4128278330836	5674.7825946326984	6524.0480699078244	4871.3971987982304	1.3392560293620277	3.4902921040151869	2.5927890857087248	0.0628	1.0445153017339555	8921.6369943024147	12448.962590024579	9488.5556449025607	10802.671897609367	0.89157549046160123	5.8307683529508454	6.6855260694479863	-0.0251	0.982743509356707856	7991.4823887084403	7190.6575843304208	8544.7978330133592	6179.0186151332964	1.3157933763278702	4.3058005231859475	3.3795018255762579	0.3751	1.29696593918570787	1247.4119315453465	1676.8986851475372	1442.5307357843053	1468.8933611587788	0.98712625033868495	0.68899287824359834	0.67346644725074367	0.3192	1.24764967380269488	1635.7205285851155	1958.6034740010325	1878.3372148735464	1705.6180480387322	1.0590325064072497	1.0498821709842132	1.0098428343213208	0.2502	1.18934537908081429	3565.8078494924152	4700.2432052520844	3977.0239611857983	4036.7107274169875	0.99281993756707554	2.3627936869609862	2.4610064507809746	0.0389	1.027333092886177710	6889.5935968891526	8379.1083477572192	7407.259817166143	7218.600249143361	1.0477566590484211	3.8627450253797941	3.908068226276423	0.0979	1.070227644885814811	6542.7597373378321	10103.914679280837	7057.7359153188145	8733.7363701550585	0.83565419339456815	4.4889362441036624	5.4626722374391123	-0.2232	0.8566343653037301612	3333.7279078999545	4085.2611072456357	3728.1250081551766	3510.2335170560686	1.0821746463229893	2.1339342737856524	1.8815552110245208	-0.2278	0.8539598780323668413	2484.8221844624368	3639.0117931584664	2810.3253436107971	3129.1024697872995	0.92601754559702154	1.3889779311638735	1.4078484663990638	0.0620	1.04389452958095714	4875.0802344509557	6296.1551402856567	5343.726227194381	5410.2960005479017	1.00663517040004	2.7415414280295241	2.7010865248115881	-0.1829	0.8809276090180869815	1901.0318924521168	2282.3332057784246	2168.4084577293752	1983.7449533233291	1.0743786931515811	1.2707374989580462	1.2076241289906768	0.0355	1.024932535579318416	1565.3515243621468	2655.1140858625104	1798.9803811033057	2297.4977223852534	0.8120806411267899	0.91424925510657629	1.2066104451108657	-0.2315	0.8517434959093886917	569.92660496321673	765.16890558801697	663.02784829130348	696.83945165325679	0.9484989798722534	0.38610471678635855	0.42059393964879732	0.1568	1.114791786703357718	2579.4912365407449	3672.8591647922294	2915.7069863884794	3159.0542781190652	0.91948738333013391	1.6642326196857982	1.8378603596395526	-0.0926	0.9378628227233375419	1496.9880817123876	2210.2227393219832	1721.3755314372318	1919.7154135050912	0.90649064206411556	0.97870230128751334	1.1155770239838017	-0.0858	0.9422453255318815620	1049.7257624095091	1349.1416879646806	1217.4064346269734	1192.6839740742157	1.0174605886780543	0.79563266075407324	0.83419487137728066	-0.2896	0.81812160819329816!sample_table_end
