DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM407nnn/GSM407041/suppl/GSM407041_NN538.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM407nnn/GSM407041/suppl/GSM407041_NN539.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16598!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1796.7468088023663	2247.138637646055	1975.4881931725554	2012.9208873241298	1.3055661756079657	1.3779428356338275	0.94747484572350205	-0.0371	0.974598124014473992	2306.6940169277318	2608.8491119652326	2477.0993443904536	2334.7418330789715	1.4944005746030069	1.4130411874343121	1.0575775058025172	0.1178	1.08505341551604893	1266.6705164877696	1322.3559701675804	1421.3002656504395	1215.3263789308278	0.97834277544014148	0.85885111097455913	1.1391296616359874	0.2943	1.22625911770241364	5696.2446683899843	5761.044853098836	5530.8343901969993	5071.063256821818	3.2480704619723535	3.0964156752296876	1.048977528422897	-0.0652	0.955837531094473895	7404.9483453151006	11059.979151134414	7024.138672101446	9527.8028892419934	5.2468139516809078	7.1587022487539498	0.73292808799167097	-0.2484	0.841836414101848516	5041.3872096684563	5082.067052008877	4966.0878642389462	4489.769428872658	3.2709772703733018	3.0117365978262125	1.0860768078902392	0.2267	1.17014103107950087	1443.9683406020574	1436.148025062723	1610.0069018781496	1311.7918028472043	0.64840854116847579	0.63299616308239037	1.0243482962219463	0.5691	1.48359348459733158	1115.6738446283059	1535.1910500725428	1257.2763262378398	1397.5276811249503	0.73201868107190515	0.84828823721460056	0.8629362626499778	0.0907	1.06490251298242289	1786.2015783700383	2746.5895181071955	1965.1893156154385	2452.804130607914	1.6306131240045412	1.988174967844752	0.82015574603686925	-0.3402	0.7899470990340625710	4366.3200926148857	6063.9368302313542	4371.1920985887109	5332.6700637134663	2.7251989757944144	3.6485004592423356	0.74693672269958877	-0.2710	0.8287228080683480811	6363.6366333014348	9862.2906522379799	6110.415618251217	8535.8427536465206	3.6676586926666173	5.3523457239429906	0.68524323387030939	-0.3700	0.7737936391471714712	6972.2678204037857	4231.4136024753734	6641.3557803188478	3754.6525786879315	4.4364090464075829	2.5129830732909011	1.7653955148204963	0.6674	1.588153433213522113	1421.6169796682516	2212.9347125857926	1587.4505968308997	1982.3811644401458	1.2302672204418572	1.4294330113217044	0.86066797863042821	-0.1468	0.9032661980192505714	8585.5567324498934	7273.0474593666368	8134.5871000202769	6358.6687592372664	4.2103912138510848	3.5145718405468021	1.1979812634007865	0.1318	1.095637874161293515	1439.0222111889489	1782.4476490570478	1601.6555954210371	1610.8752252941604	1.075029259565615	1.2022287913999286	0.8941969010023485	0.0495	1.034899561952670916	1225.703717457282	1817.1727760839487	1376.0134014419807	1640.7268373235943	0.76230004856574585	0.90487543028629969	0.84243645373878329	-0.0409	0.9720431699220434317	455.80410750397834	605.99946543665874	501.62362579322212	605.00723493331066	0.30988305008462197	0.3344764059893362	0.92647207556547861	0.0530	1.037453498803222718	2434.3742766513133	3294.9257254922895	2612.7733426604195	2935.0007167079839	1.4688240551233918	1.5611409425030507	0.94086575730206445	0.0847	1.060478320653063519	1227.6528724211478	1493.1039053066886	1379.2524420072855	1359.8220300075	0.80743694461193227	0.84400012817288583	0.95667869904225422	0.0042	1.002929978008349420	1125.5305704619548	1239.8027326705983	1268.5670486103622	1147.4037856855364	0.75849383834112305	0.73186934201774101	1.0363787561451601	-0.1949	0.87363624503709525!sample_table_end
