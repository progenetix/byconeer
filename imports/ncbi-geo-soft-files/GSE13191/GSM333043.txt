After mixing by inversion the DNA was collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 g and 4Â°C, the supernatant aspirated and the pellet air-dried for approximately 5-10 min. The pellet was then dissolved in 13 Âµl Yeast tRNA (100 Âµg/Âµl, Invitrogen) and 26 Âµl 20% SDS taking care to prevent foam formation. After incubating at room temperature for 15 min 91 Âµl of Master mix (14.3 % (w/v) dextran sulphate (USB), 50% (v/v) formamide (Invitrogen), 2.9 X SSC pH 7.0 (Sigma)) was added and gently mixed. The hybridization solution was then incubated at 73Â°C for 10 min to denature the DNA and subsequently at 37Â°C for 60 min to allow the Cot-1 DNA to block repetitive sequences. Hybridization and washing was done automatically using a GeneTAC/HybArray12 hybstation (Genomic Solutions / Perkin Elmer). Hybridisation was for 38 h at 37Â°C. Subsequently slides were washed 6 cycles (flow for 10 s, hold for 20 s) with 50% (v/v) formamide, 2X SSC, 2 cycles with phosphate-buffer (0.1 M Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 0.1% (v/v) Igepal CA630 (Sigma)), 2 cycles with 0.2 X SSC (Sigma) and 2 cycles with 0.1 X SSC. Slides were then taken out of the hybstation and briefly rinsed in 0.01 X SSC, dried by centrifugation for 3 min at 1000 g and scanned using a Microarray Scanner G2505B (Agilent Technologies). !Sample_data_processing = The raw signal intensities were obtained with Bluefuse .
