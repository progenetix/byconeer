Add the following components in the order indicated to reaction tubes containing 150 ï­l of purified Cy5- and Cy3-labeled sample mixture: 50Âµl Cot-1 DNA (1.0 mg/ml) (Invitrogen 15279-011), 50Âµl Agilent 10x Blocking Reagent, 250Âµl Agilent 2x Hybridization Buffer. 2. Transfer sample tubes to circulating water bath at 95Â°C.  Incubate at 95Â°C for 3.0 min, 3. then move to ice. 4. Transfer sample tubes to circulating water bath (bzw. Heizblock) 1at 37Â°C.  Incubate at 37Â°C for 30 min. 5. Remove samples from water bath. 6. Centrifuge 5 min at 17,900 x g (13,000 rpm in Eppendorf 5417R) in microfuge to pellet any precipitates. 7. Carefully remove supernatant materials. Detailed instructions on the use of Surehyb chambers can be found at www.agilent.com. Load a clean SureHyb gasket slide into the chamber base with the label facing up and aligned with the rectangular section of the chamber base.  Ensure that the gasket slide is flush with the chamber base and is not ajar.  Slowly dispense 490 ï­l of hybridization mixture onto the gasket well in a âdrag and dispenseâ manner. Place an array active side down onto the Surehyb gasket, so the numeric barcode side is facing up.  Assess that the sandwich-pair is properly aligned. Place the chamber cover onto the sandwiched slides and slide the clamp assembly onto both pieces.  Hand-tighten the clamp onto the chamber. Vertically rotate the assembled chamber to wet the gasket and assess the mobility of the bubbles.  Tap the assembly on a hard surface if necessary to move stationary bubbles. Set your hybridization rotator to rotate at 20 rpm.   Hybridize at 65oC for 40 hr. Wash: 1. Completely fill a first slide staining dish with Wash 1 (0.5x SSPE, 0.005% N-lauroylsarcosine) at room temperature. 2. Place slide rack into a second slide staining dish. Add magnetic stir bar. Fill the slide staining dish with enough Wash 1 (0.5x SSPE, 0.005% N-lauroylsarcosine) at room temperature to cover the slide rack. Place this dish on a magnetic stir plate. 3. Remove one hybridization chamber from incubator. 4. Disassemble the hybridization chamber and place the array-gasket sandwich in the first slide staining dish filled with Wash 1 (0.5x SSPE, 0.005% N-lauroylsarcosine) at room temperature. 5. With the sandwich completely submerged in Wash 1 (0.5x SSPE, 0.005% N-lauroylsarcosine), pry the sandwich open with one of the blunt ends of the tweezers. 6. Remove slide and place into slide rack in the second slide staining dish containing Wash 1 (0.5x SSPE, 0.005% N-lauroylsarcosine) at room temperature. Minimize exposure of the slide to air. 7. Repeat steps 7.9.6 and 7.9.7 for all remaining hybridization chambers in group.  A maximum of 4 disassembly procedures yielding 4 slides is advised if you are using a 10-slide rack. 8. When all slides in the group are placed into slide rack in staining dish, stir using setting 4 for 5.0 min. 9. During Wash 1 incubation put pre-warmed (37Â°C) 1.5 liter dish filled with water and containing a slide staining dish on the magnetic stirrer with heating element (setting 3.5). Fill the slide staining dish approximately Â¾ full with Wash 2 (0.1x SSPE, 0.005% N-lauroylsarcosine) (pre-warmed to 37Â°C).  Add magnetic stir bar.  Maintain temperature of Wash 2 at 37Â°C. 10. Transfer slide rack to slide staining dish filled with Wash 2 at 37Â°C, and stir using setting 4 for 1.0 min. 11. Slowly remove slides from Wash2 trying to minimize droplets on the slide. It should take 5 to 10 s. to remove the slide rack. 12. Scan slides slides immediately to minimize impact of environmental oxidants on signal intensities.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on Agilent Array scanner G2505B following manufacturers recommendations, scan resolution: 10Âµm.!Sample_scan_protocol = Images were quantified using Feature Extraction Software (version A.7.5.1, June 2004) (Agilent Technologies).!Sample_description = MDC vs control genomic DNA!Sample_data_processing = Linear&LOWESS normalized log10 ratios (red/green) (standard settings of Feature Extraction Software), converted to log2 ratios (test/reference) afterwards!Sample_platform_id = GPL2873!Sample_contact_name = Brigitte,,Royer-Pokora!Sample_contact_email = royer@uni-duesseldorf.de!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Human Genetics and Anthropology, Heinrich-Heine-University Duesseldorf!Sample_contact_address = UniversitÃ¤tsstr. 1!Sample_contact_city = Duesseldorf!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40225!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM218nnn/GSM218821/suppl/GSM218821.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8804!Sample_data_row_count = 40377#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 ratio (test/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE3	-0.1772265244	0.0138265455	-0.3472755156	-0.2193628648	0.0771933069	-0.17637047610	-0.50628656112	0.11409896113	-0.04565447815	-0.13158603116	0.00473264717	-0.19805927218	0.04586012519	-0.19769947720	0.34021322922	-0.18611251623	-0.00945755424	0.27384365825	-0.10172412226	0.025743191!sample_table_end
