Cells were cultured for 3-4 months in vitro or xenografted in mouse eyes within 7 days after infection. Xenografts were performed on 6-week-old male athymic (Foxn1-/-) mice (Taconic, Hudson, NY) or 6-week-old male Nod/Scid/Il2r-gamma-/- mice (Jackson Laboratories).!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Cell lines were grown according to standard conditions. Cells were cultured in RB culture medium (Iscoveâs Modified Dulbeccoâs Medium (IMDM), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 55 micro-Molar beta-mercaptoethanol, with glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, fungizone, and 10Î¼g/ml Plasmocin (Invivogen)!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from RB cell lines or xenografted mouse eye samples using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Standard Affymetrix protocol!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix Reagent Kit  Bundle, catalog no. 901835). The DNA was hybridized to the microarray, washed on the GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix), stained with Affymetrix GeneChip Stain Reagents.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000 7G System (Affymetrix, 00-0213).!Sample_description = Hybridized to CytoScan HD 750K!Sample_description = 20130903_162458_003_Cell line 3-WERI!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using AffymetrixÂ® GeneChipÂ® Command ConsoleÂ® (AGCC) Software and CEL files were created for signal intensity data. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files using Chromosome Analysis Suite 2.0 (Affymetrix CHAS 2.0) software. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by combination of segments of gains or losses if they are separated by small spans of normal copy number segments. The default value defining âsmall spansâ in ChAS is 50 markers and 200 kbp. Inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in Chromosome Analysis Suite 2.0. Standard named setting was used as segments filters setting in CHAS 2.0. UCSC Genomic Version hg19 was used as reference.!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-name = CYTO2!Sample_data_processing = affymetrix-algorithm-version = 1.15.1!Sample_data_processing = program-name = apt-copynumber-cyto.exe!Sample_data_processing = program-version = 1.15.1!Sample_data_processing = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Xiaoliang Leon,,Xu!Sample_contact_email = xux2@mskcc.org!Sample_contact_phone = 2129204781!Sample_contact_institute = MSKCC!Sample_contact_address = 410 E 69th ST, Z445B!Sample_contact_city = New York!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 10021!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1486nnn/GSM1486290/suppl/GSM1486290_20130903_162458_003_Cell_line_3-WERI.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1486nnn/GSM1486290/suppl/GSM1486290_20130903_162458_003_Cell_line_3-WERI.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE60720!Sample_data_row_count = 0
