Log2ratios of background corrected values for tumour over normal DNA were calculated. Normalization was carried out on Agilent's CGH Analytics, integrated on the Agilent Genomic Workbench Standard Edition 6.5.0.58, using data from the internal set of control probes included in the microarray. Detection of Copy Number Alterations (CNAs) was performed using the ADM-2 algorithm, also implemented within the Agilent's genomics suite Genomic Workbench v5.0, with a threshold of 6.5 and a minimum of 5 consecutive probes and default settings of Nexus 6.0 Discovery Edition (Biodiscovery, El segundo, CA).  All alterations were analyzed by visual inspection of two different observers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Itziar,,Salaverria!Sample_contact_email = isalaver@clinic.cat!Sample_contact_institute = Hospital ClÃ­nic!Sample_contact_address = Rossello 153!Sample_contact_city = Barcelona!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 08036!Sample_contact_country = Spain!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1151nnn/GSM1151280/suppl/GSM1151280_Case11_CGH_1010_Sep10.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE47506!Sample_series_id = GSE47508!Sample_data_row_count = 243430
