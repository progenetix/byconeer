(20) In short, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded FFPE tissue of uterine corpus cancer was used. Cases were discarded if the tumor cell percentage was below 70%.  Genomic DNA was isolated from 10*10Âµm thick paraffin slides. Slides were deparaffinized twice in xylene for 5 minutes, rehydrated in 100% (twice), 90%,70% ethanol and stained with hematoxylin. To remove formalin induced cross-links an overnight incubation in 1M NaSCN at 37Â°C was performed. Slides were subsequently washed in PBS twice for 10 minutes and air-dried. Tumor cells were collected by macro dissection by scraping from the slides and cells were transferred to a tube containing 200 Âµl ATL buffer (QIAampÂ® DNA Mini Kit cat 51304, Qiagen), 27 Âµl Proteinase-K was added and samples were incubated at 55Â°C while shaken at 450 rmp for at least 40 hours.
