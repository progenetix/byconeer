DNA quality and quantity were assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, and labeled according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions. The arrays were then washed using Affymetrix Fluidics stations.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = C_20_IPN_M_C!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Operating Software (GCOS version 3.0.2). Signal intensities and Genotypes for individual SNPs were obtained from CEL files using the R/BioConductor 'crlmm' package.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype calls are included in the Sample data table; the summarized signals for alleles A and B, and the confidence scores for the genotype calls, are included in supplementary files that are linked to the Series record (GSE46812).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6804!Sample_contact_name = Benilton,Sa,Carvalho!Sample_contact_laboratory = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_department = Medical Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = Universidade Estadual de Campinas!Sample_contact_address = TessÃ¡lia Vieira de Camargo, 126!Sample_contact_city = Campinas!Sample_contact_state = Sao Paulo!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 13083887!Sample_contact_country = Brazil!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1138nnn/GSM1138658/suppl/GSM1138658_C_20_IPN_M_C.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE46812!Sample_data_row_count = 500568
