Fresh frozen tumor tissue were homogenized and digested before phenol chloroform extraction on the ABI 341 system. DNA was stored at 4ÂºC until use.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 100 ng genomic DNA was amplified using phi29 DNA polymerase at 30ÂºC, 16 hours over night. Amplified DNA was digested using 50 units AluI and 50 units RsaI nucleases, 2 hours incubation at 37ÂºC. The amplified and digested DNA was purified using QIAprep Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer's protocol, and quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies).  10 Î¼g amplified and digested DNA was labeled with Cy5-dUTP (PerkinElmer) using the BioPrime Labeling System (Invitrogen).
