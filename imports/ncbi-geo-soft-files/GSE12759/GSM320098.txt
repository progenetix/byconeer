(Genes Chromosomes Cancer 2007).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned in Agilent Microarray scanner.!Sample_description = Array CGH analysis was employed to identify and confirm changes in the gene expression of a number of different genes mapping to the 11q chromosomal region, associated with CCND1 amplification. The subsequent protein expression of these candidate genes was then examined in a clinical material of 500 primary breast cancers from premenopausal patients randomized to either tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment. The protein expression was also compared to the CGH data in a subset of 56 breast cancer samples.!Sample_data_processing = Image analysis was performed using Genepix v4.0. Result files were uploaded into BASE (Saal et al., Genome Biology 2002) where they were filtered and pin-based lowess normalised.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320098/suppl/GSM320098.GPR.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12759!Sample_data_row_count = 31952#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalised log2ratio (ch1/ch2).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE27039	-0.08457449422668	-0.2069237666764	0.11726137113919	-0.28933769326310	0.0183498968167	0.09280080319040	-0.05754025313568	0.23791470820144	0.27407158832004	-0.31601616433434	0.13801293217422	0.0672725065024	-0.2789059713823	-0.020968571266	-0.3625179996	-0.34918561912918	-0.1587604523855	-0.3260229323448	-0.09077086111285	0.03763541!sample_table_end
