(Genes Chromosomes Cancer 2007).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned in Agilent Microarray scanner.!Sample_description = Array CGH analysis was employed to identify and confirm changes in the gene expression of a number of different genes mapping to the 11q chromosomal region, associated with CCND1 amplification. The subsequent protein expression of these candidate genes was then examined in a clinical material of 500 primary breast cancers from premenopausal patients randomized to either tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment. The protein expression was also compared to the CGH data in a subset of 56 breast cancer samples.!Sample_data_processing = Image analysis was performed using Genepix v4.0. Result files were uploaded into BASE (Saal et al., Genome Biology 2002) where they were filtered and pin-based lowess normalised.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320111/suppl/GSM320111.GPR.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12759!Sample_data_row_count = 31952#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalised log2ratio (ch1/ch2).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE27039	-0.14866611522668	0.0287784916764	-0.13422215113919	-0.18259644926310	0.0174776558167	-0.18085812119040	-0.19344109413568	0.18528997820144	-0.58590347932004	0.70520223233434	17422	-0.8890627295024	-0.25506803113823	0.351078666266	-0.043449265996	0.13847852812918	-0.1120622923855	-0.5966587753448	-0.02775258211285	0.22397585!sample_table_end
