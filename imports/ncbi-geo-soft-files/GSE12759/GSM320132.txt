(Genes Chromosomes Cancer 2007).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned in Agilent Microarray scanner.!Sample_description = Array CGH analysis was employed to identify and confirm changes in the gene expression of a number of different genes mapping to the 11q chromosomal region, associated with CCND1 amplification. The subsequent protein expression of these candidate genes was then examined in a clinical material of 500 primary breast cancers from premenopausal patients randomized to either tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment. The protein expression was also compared to the CGH data in a subset of 56 breast cancer samples.!Sample_data_processing = Image analysis was performed using Genepix v4.0. Result files were uploaded into BASE (Saal et al., Genome Biology 2002) where they were filtered and pin-based lowess normalised.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320132/suppl/GSM320132.GPR.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12759!Sample_data_row_count = 31952#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalised log2ratio (ch1/ch2).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE27039	-0.11366199422668	-0.0335390156764	0.09705027513919	-0.41505075526310	-0.0711656888167	-0.17751685519040	-0.2586825713568	-1.39E-0520144	0.1484944232004	-0.5427543233434	-0.06986651317422	-0.1102515755024	-0.01385247313823	-0.202240872266	-0.039066105996	0.52981694512918	-0.54633623523855	-0.5925712323448	-0.21848894411285	0.045433636!sample_table_end
