(Genes Chromosomes Cancer 2007).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned in Agilent Microarray scanner.!Sample_description = Array CGH analysis was employed to identify and confirm changes in the gene expression of a number of different genes mapping to the 11q chromosomal region, associated with CCND1 amplification. The subsequent protein expression of these candidate genes was then examined in a clinical material of 500 primary breast cancers from premenopausal patients randomized to either tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment. The protein expression was also compared to the CGH data in a subset of 56 breast cancer samples.!Sample_data_processing = Image analysis was performed using Genepix v4.0. Result files were uploaded into BASE (Saal et al., Genome Biology 2002) where they were filtered and pin-based lowess normalised.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320138/suppl/GSM320138.GPR.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12759!Sample_data_row_count = 31952#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalised log2ratio (ch1/ch2).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE27039	0.39171547122668	-0.0183812126764	-0.27987453913919	-0.2448727726310	-0.3477620358167	-0.0915963619040	-0.27477036313568	-0.28113359620144	-0.5755171132004	0.28757796333434	-0.37335058317422	-0.603226955024	0.31450002513823	-0.345345204266	-0.213416427996	-0.08821969712918	-0.15065288423855	-0.5187634223448	-0.47876333511285	-0.747828139!sample_table_end
