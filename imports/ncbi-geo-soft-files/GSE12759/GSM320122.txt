(Genes Chromosomes Cancer 2007).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned in Agilent Microarray scanner.!Sample_description = Array CGH analysis was employed to identify and confirm changes in the gene expression of a number of different genes mapping to the 11q chromosomal region, associated with CCND1 amplification. The subsequent protein expression of these candidate genes was then examined in a clinical material of 500 primary breast cancers from premenopausal patients randomized to either tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment. The protein expression was also compared to the CGH data in a subset of 56 breast cancer samples.!Sample_data_processing = Image analysis was performed using Genepix v4.0. Result files were uploaded into BASE (Saal et al., Genome Biology 2002) where they were filtered and pin-based lowess normalised.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320122/suppl/GSM320122.GPR.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12759!Sample_data_row_count = 31952#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalised log2ratio (ch1/ch2).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE27039	0.00576099322668	0.134880426764	-0.25037113919	-0.08668759826310	0.0061415668167	0.23349528919040	0.20631147913568	0.0032494720144	0.09862623832004	0.18772721233434	-0.45163218517422	-0.3076763565024	-0.15451565913823	-0.051315695266	0.068253275996	-0.01441825512918	0.08624672623855	0.0610546713448	0.00594862611285	-0.104469146!sample_table_end
