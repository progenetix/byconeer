The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Anders,,Isaksson!Sample_contact_email = anders.isaksson@medsci.uu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Akademiska sjukhuset ing61 3tr!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75185!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM402nnn/GSM402761/suppl/GSM402761.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16092!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity#BAF = B allele frequency!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BAFSNP_A-1780270	0.018061	0.54638SNP_A-1780272	-0.1206	1.0227SNP_A-1780285	0.30678	NaNSNP_A-1780286	0.32834	0.54408SNP_A-1780287	-0.062006	0.067875SNP_A-1780289	0.51791	1.0491SNP_A-1780292	0.69554	1.1334SNP_A-1780294	0.14302	-0.0063945SNP_A-1780295	-0.20951	1.0084SNP_A-1780300	0.74021	NaNSNP_A-1780302	0.25046	-0.046855SNP_A-1780303	0.40132	NaNSNP_A-1780304	-0.086615	-0.027172SNP_A-1780305	-0.18646	1.011SNP_A-1780311	0.070777	-0.094975SNP_A-1780312	0.033004	-0.1464SNP_A-1780313	0.33194	0.017589SNP_A-1780316	-0.056981	0.95661SNP_A-1780318	-0.017952	NaNSNP_A-1780320	0.12414	0.64831!sample_table_end
