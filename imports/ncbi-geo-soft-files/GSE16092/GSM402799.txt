The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Anders,,Isaksson!Sample_contact_email = anders.isaksson@medsci.uu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Akademiska sjukhuset ing61 3tr!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75185!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM402nnn/GSM402799/suppl/GSM402799.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16092!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity#BAF = B allele frequency!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BAFSNP_A-1780270	-0.13261	0.050553SNP_A-1780272	-0.21391	0.83618SNP_A-1780285	0.16606	NaNSNP_A-1780286	0.25238	0.51184SNP_A-1780287	-0.38541	-0.018378SNP_A-1780289	0.10372	1.0283SNP_A-1780292	0.015695	1.0673SNP_A-1780294	-0.58327	1.026SNP_A-1780295	0.29952	1.0167SNP_A-1780300	-0.4222	NaNSNP_A-1780302	0.50144	-0.052968SNP_A-1780303	-0.26923	NaNSNP_A-1780304	0.39198	-0.045149SNP_A-1780305	0.041684	0.55459SNP_A-1780311	-0.20046	0.43165SNP_A-1780312	-0.32364	1.0149SNP_A-1780313	0.14549	1.0185SNP_A-1780316	-0.44464	1.5257SNP_A-1780318	0.016982	NaNSNP_A-1780320	0.074746	0.93401!sample_table_end
