The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Anders,,Isaksson!Sample_contact_email = anders.isaksson@medsci.uu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Akademiska sjukhuset ing61 3tr!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75185!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM402nnn/GSM402768/suppl/GSM402768.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16092!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity#BAF = B allele frequency!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BAFSNP_A-1780270	0.049998	0.42772SNP_A-1780272	-0.028362	1.0146SNP_A-1780285	0.068912	NaNSNP_A-1780286	0.050643	0.54454SNP_A-1780287	0.15539	-0.019739SNP_A-1780289	-0.20648	0.89738SNP_A-1780292	0.24627	1.1377SNP_A-1780294	-0.0099693	1.0232SNP_A-1780295	-0.4077	1.008SNP_A-1780300	0.066265	NaNSNP_A-1780302	0.19252	0.60813SNP_A-1780303	0.23729	NaNSNP_A-1780304	-0.031202	-0.033741SNP_A-1780305	-0.10621	-0.0073971SNP_A-1780311	-0.11209	-0.10234SNP_A-1780312	0.16258	-0.071707SNP_A-1780313	-0.2033	1.0166SNP_A-1780316	-0.17545	1.5588SNP_A-1780318	-0.15129	NaNSNP_A-1780320	0.055373	0.62402!sample_table_end
