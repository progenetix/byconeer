The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Anders,,Isaksson!Sample_contact_email = anders.isaksson@medsci.uu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Akademiska sjukhuset ing61 3tr!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75185!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM402nnn/GSM402784/suppl/GSM402784.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16092!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity#BAF = B allele frequency!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BAFSNP_A-1780270	0.44276	0.26457SNP_A-1780272	0.52413	1.0034SNP_A-1780285	-0.0081384	NaNSNP_A-1780286	0.96171	0.5096SNP_A-1780287	-0.23044	0.05362SNP_A-1780289	0.27235	1.047SNP_A-1780292	0.17983	1.0075SNP_A-1780294	0.0063954	1.0112SNP_A-1780295	-0.69547	0.97047SNP_A-1780300	0.72942	NaNSNP_A-1780302	0.206	-0.090785SNP_A-1780303	0.59842	NaNSNP_A-1780304	0.19038	-0.025492SNP_A-1780305	0.16671	0.49786SNP_A-1780311	0.32377	-0.13301SNP_A-1780312	0.33795	-0.045605SNP_A-1780313	-0.26028	1.0297SNP_A-1780316	-0.42271	1.3305SNP_A-1780318	0.84627	NaNSNP_A-1780320	-0.59503	0.38768!sample_table_end
