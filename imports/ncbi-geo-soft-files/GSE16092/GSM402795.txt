The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Anders,,Isaksson!Sample_contact_email = anders.isaksson@medsci.uu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Akademiska sjukhuset ing61 3tr!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75185!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM402nnn/GSM402795/suppl/GSM402795.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16092!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity#BAF = B allele frequency!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BAFSNP_A-1780270	0.31647	0.47226SNP_A-1780272	0.43172	0.92414SNP_A-1780285	0.27625	NaNSNP_A-1780286	0.22401	0.55138SNP_A-1780287	-0.15038	0.047223SNP_A-1780289	0.096881	1.0289SNP_A-1780292	0.61185	1.2055SNP_A-1780294	-0.091689	0.35682SNP_A-1780295	-0.35052	0.98831SNP_A-1780300	0.47815	NaNSNP_A-1780302	0.41445	-0.0061883SNP_A-1780303	0.13247	NaNSNP_A-1780304	0.35281	0.00030672SNP_A-1780305	-0.14071	1.0167SNP_A-1780311	-0.035069	-0.12976SNP_A-1780312	0.27698	0.11924SNP_A-1780313	-0.059437	0.25216SNP_A-1780316	-0.27435	0.63936SNP_A-1780318	0.30088	NaNSNP_A-1780320	0.21262	0.49556!sample_table_end
