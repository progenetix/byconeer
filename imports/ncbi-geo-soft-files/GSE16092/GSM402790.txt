The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Anders,,Isaksson!Sample_contact_email = anders.isaksson@medsci.uu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Akademiska sjukhuset ing61 3tr!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75185!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM402nnn/GSM402790/suppl/GSM402790.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16092!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity#BAF = B allele frequency!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BAFSNP_A-1780270	-0.18308	1.017SNP_A-1780272	0.61606	0.36976SNP_A-1780285	0.22476	NaNSNP_A-1780286	0.42687	0.52322SNP_A-1780287	-0.13614	-0.033746SNP_A-1780289	0.14455	0.9658SNP_A-1780292	0.49729	1.2075SNP_A-1780294	-0.22862	0.73234SNP_A-1780295	0.23227	1.0046SNP_A-1780300	0.1507	NaNSNP_A-1780302	-0.11825	-0.054215SNP_A-1780303	-0.043658	NaNSNP_A-1780304	0.98443	0.55293SNP_A-1780305	-0.47019	0.21069SNP_A-1780311	0.020363	-0.34227SNP_A-1780312	0.44381	-0.015187SNP_A-1780313	0.34153	0.48474SNP_A-1780316	-0.28732	1.5748SNP_A-1780318	-0.0051608	NaNSNP_A-1780320	0.30115	1.0756!sample_table_end
