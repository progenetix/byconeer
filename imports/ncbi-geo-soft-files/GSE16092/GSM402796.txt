The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Anders,,Isaksson!Sample_contact_email = anders.isaksson@medsci.uu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Akademiska sjukhuset ing61 3tr!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75185!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM402nnn/GSM402796/suppl/GSM402796.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16092!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity#BAF = B allele frequency!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BAFSNP_A-1780270	0.34702	0.5803SNP_A-1780272	0.45204	0.97005SNP_A-1780285	-0.34743	NaNSNP_A-1780286	0.52479	0.53325SNP_A-1780287	-0.26809	0.024926SNP_A-1780289	-0.2502	1.0198SNP_A-1780292	-0.219	0.90894SNP_A-1780294	-0.0069974	0.50809SNP_A-1780295	-0.0017219	0.97335SNP_A-1780300	0.1037	NaNSNP_A-1780302	-0.47683	1.042SNP_A-1780303	0.24049	NaNSNP_A-1780304	0.5488	0.82992SNP_A-1780305	-0.26987	0.78559SNP_A-1780311	0.059452	-0.004129SNP_A-1780312	0.10659	0.62208SNP_A-1780313	0.04159	0.61386SNP_A-1780316	0.114	0.6897SNP_A-1780318	-0.093588	NaNSNP_A-1780320	0.76723	0.95976!sample_table_end
