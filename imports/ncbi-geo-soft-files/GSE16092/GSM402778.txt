The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Anders,,Isaksson!Sample_contact_email = anders.isaksson@medsci.uu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Akademiska sjukhuset ing61 3tr!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75185!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM402nnn/GSM402778/suppl/GSM402778.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16092!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity#BAF = B allele frequency!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BAFSNP_A-1780270	0.33309	0.54697SNP_A-1780272	0.3222	0.99533SNP_A-1780285	0.062236	NaNSNP_A-1780286	0.29802	0.53525SNP_A-1780287	-0.24179	-0.038396SNP_A-1780289	0.022791	0.99725SNP_A-1780292	0.63917	1.0031SNP_A-1780294	-0.34427	0.99844SNP_A-1780295	0.72824	0.90965SNP_A-1780300	0.54342	NaNSNP_A-1780302	0.012282	1.0322SNP_A-1780303	-0.1613	NaNSNP_A-1780304	0.31114	-0.019326SNP_A-1780305	0.0047489	0.98821SNP_A-1780311	-0.004429	0.0082081SNP_A-1780312	-0.53623	0.72794SNP_A-1780313	0.69866	1.0214SNP_A-1780316	-0.25052	0.989SNP_A-1780318	-0.34364	NaNSNP_A-1780320	0.14991	0.56182!sample_table_end
