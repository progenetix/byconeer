The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Anders,,Isaksson!Sample_contact_email = anders.isaksson@medsci.uu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Akademiska sjukhuset ing61 3tr!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75185!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM402nnn/GSM402792/suppl/GSM402792.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16092!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity#BAF = B allele frequency!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BAFSNP_A-1780270	-0.14711	0.51692SNP_A-1780272	-0.038645	0.99954SNP_A-1780285	-0.15136	NaNSNP_A-1780286	-0.71207	0.61186SNP_A-1780287	0.17004	-0.016158SNP_A-1780289	-0.16104	0.95336SNP_A-1780292	-0.20677	0.82862SNP_A-1780294	0.16153	0.52986SNP_A-1780295	-0.17583	1.0273SNP_A-1780300	0.098307	NaNSNP_A-1780302	0.4839	1.0131SNP_A-1780303	0.013377	NaNSNP_A-1780304	0.18746	-0.0044243SNP_A-1780305	-0.17841	0.53081SNP_A-1780311	-0.029951	0.2187SNP_A-1780312	0.16265	-0.059042SNP_A-1780313	0.36866	0.4036SNP_A-1780316	-0.045766	1.0439SNP_A-1780318	-0.30972	NaNSNP_A-1780320	0.32031	1.0137!sample_table_end
