The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Anders,,Isaksson!Sample_contact_email = anders.isaksson@medsci.uu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Akademiska sjukhuset ing61 3tr!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75185!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM402nnn/GSM402775/suppl/GSM402775.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16092!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity#BAF = B allele frequency!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BAFSNP_A-1780270	0.20749	1.0411SNP_A-1780272	0.40883	0.3867SNP_A-1780285	-0.058307	NaNSNP_A-1780286	-0.21101	0.56433SNP_A-1780287	-0.35014	0.065316SNP_A-1780289	-0.12224	0.98753SNP_A-1780292	0.41438	1.0338SNP_A-1780294	-0.42579	0.92491SNP_A-1780295	-0.11223	0.93688SNP_A-1780300	-0.31037	NaNSNP_A-1780302	-0.14984	0.99025SNP_A-1780303	0.056574	NaNSNP_A-1780304	-0.11195	-0.0080457SNP_A-1780305	0.077897	0.47205SNP_A-1780311	-0.16831	-0.21792SNP_A-1780312	-0.43778	1.017SNP_A-1780313	-0.37541	0.073006SNP_A-1780316	0.23503	0.71125SNP_A-1780318	0.20437	NaNSNP_A-1780320	0.034973	0.50295!sample_table_end
