The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Anders,,Isaksson!Sample_contact_email = anders.isaksson@medsci.uu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Akademiska sjukhuset ing61 3tr!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75185!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM402nnn/GSM402791/suppl/GSM402791.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16092!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity#BAF = B allele frequency!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BAFSNP_A-1780270	0.25576	0.5345SNP_A-1780272	0.34361	0.99293SNP_A-1780285	0.012479	NaNSNP_A-1780286	0.28631	0.51279SNP_A-1780287	-0.044691	-0.007943SNP_A-1780289	0.46045	1.0558SNP_A-1780292	0.1243	0.99837SNP_A-1780294	0.060242	0.49709SNP_A-1780295	-0.71898	1.0184SNP_A-1780300	0.44891	NaNSNP_A-1780302	0.72365	1.034SNP_A-1780303	-0.062712	NaNSNP_A-1780304	0.75678	0.72304SNP_A-1780305	-0.19546	0.98668SNP_A-1780311	-0.036907	-0.09772SNP_A-1780312	0.043142	0.44047SNP_A-1780313	0.0097219	0.55113SNP_A-1780316	-0.25001	1.4478SNP_A-1780318	0.14479	NaNSNP_A-1780320	0.14504	0.40331!sample_table_end
