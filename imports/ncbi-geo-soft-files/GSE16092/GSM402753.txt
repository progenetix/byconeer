The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Anders,,Isaksson!Sample_contact_email = anders.isaksson@medsci.uu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Akademiska sjukhuset ing61 3tr!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75185!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM402nnn/GSM402753/suppl/GSM402753.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16092!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity#BAF = B allele frequency!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BAFSNP_A-1780270	-0.036878	0.39503SNP_A-1780272	0.24483	1.0711SNP_A-1780285	0.17185	NaNSNP_A-1780286	-0.20359	0.57501SNP_A-1780287	0.20118	-0.079941SNP_A-1780289	-0.15266	0.97302SNP_A-1780292	-0.018374	0.6368SNP_A-1780294	-0.18744	1.0276SNP_A-1780295	0.18382	1.0183SNP_A-1780300	-0.050595	NaNSNP_A-1780302	-0.39599	0.99565SNP_A-1780303	0.088689	NaNSNP_A-1780304	0.15054	-0.026205SNP_A-1780305	-0.23736	0.98661SNP_A-1780311	-0.2795	0.28779SNP_A-1780312	0.28988	-0.065166SNP_A-1780313	0.15724	-0.011326SNP_A-1780316	0.077988	1.1072SNP_A-1780318	-0.27683	NaNSNP_A-1780320	0.32956	0.97981!sample_table_end
