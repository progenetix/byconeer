The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Anders,,Isaksson!Sample_contact_email = anders.isaksson@medsci.uu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Akademiska sjukhuset ing61 3tr!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75185!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM402nnn/GSM402793/suppl/GSM402793.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16092!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity#BAF = B allele frequency!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BAFSNP_A-1780270	0.27602	-0.0087819SNP_A-1780272	0.30972	0.9467SNP_A-1780285	-0.21005	NaNSNP_A-1780286	-0.33583	0.52012SNP_A-1780287	0.090267	-0.0022033SNP_A-1780289	-0.3681	0.99249SNP_A-1780292	-0.15742	0.48621SNP_A-1780294	-0.2598	0.91918SNP_A-1780295	0.0085729	0.92751SNP_A-1780300	-0.08142	NaNSNP_A-1780302	0.48614	0.65857SNP_A-1780303	0.26428	NaNSNP_A-1780304	0.027257	0.011483SNP_A-1780305	-0.30437	0.44167SNP_A-1780311	0.22352	-0.24588SNP_A-1780312	-0.1727	0.50192SNP_A-1780313	-0.027748	0.013694SNP_A-1780316	0.28078	0.53103SNP_A-1780318	-0.24929	NaNSNP_A-1780320	0.08982	0.96285!sample_table_end
