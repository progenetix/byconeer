The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Anders,,Isaksson!Sample_contact_email = anders.isaksson@medsci.uu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Akademiska sjukhuset ing61 3tr!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75185!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM402nnn/GSM402762/suppl/GSM402762.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16092!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity#BAF = B allele frequency!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BAFSNP_A-1780270	0.44785	0.69984SNP_A-1780272	0.51649	0.99683SNP_A-1780285	-0.35491	NaNSNP_A-1780286	0.29668	0.52306SNP_A-1780287	-0.20017	-0.00095326SNP_A-1780289	0.17013	1.0405SNP_A-1780292	0.12862	0.78869SNP_A-1780294	-0.17384	0.9623SNP_A-1780295	-0.46789	1.0125SNP_A-1780300	0.44312	NaNSNP_A-1780302	0.37389	1.0393SNP_A-1780303	-0.039447	NaNSNP_A-1780304	0.65976	0.44016SNP_A-1780305	-0.13456	-0.0053853SNP_A-1780311	0.061441	0.023739SNP_A-1780312	0.28245	0.031239SNP_A-1780313	0.010804	0.61225SNP_A-1780316	-0.0091493	0.64052SNP_A-1780318	-0.1306	NaNSNP_A-1780320	0.22806	0.97568!sample_table_end
