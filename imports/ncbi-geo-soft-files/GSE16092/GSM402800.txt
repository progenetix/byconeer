The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Anders,,Isaksson!Sample_contact_email = anders.isaksson@medsci.uu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Akademiska sjukhuset ing61 3tr!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75185!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM402nnn/GSM402800/suppl/GSM402800.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16092!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity#BAF = B allele frequency!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BAFSNP_A-1780270	-0.55214	1.0249SNP_A-1780272	-0.10032	0.6234SNP_A-1780285	0.019402	NaNSNP_A-1780286	0.055008	0.51689SNP_A-1780287	-0.45924	-0.025311SNP_A-1780289	-0.27685	1.0579SNP_A-1780292	0.61918	1.1749SNP_A-1780294	-0.57906	0.76406SNP_A-1780295	0.30002	0.95694SNP_A-1780300	-0.64434	NaNSNP_A-1780302	0.16706	-0.072761SNP_A-1780303	-0.19618	NaNSNP_A-1780304	1.234	0.58647SNP_A-1780305	-0.70089	0.013884SNP_A-1780311	-0.021683	0.090194SNP_A-1780312	0.61704	-0.040201SNP_A-1780313	0.32275	0.45025SNP_A-1780316	-0.36931	1.1529SNP_A-1780318	-0.00034251	NaNSNP_A-1780320	0.48293	1.0388!sample_table_end
