The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Anders,,Isaksson!Sample_contact_email = anders.isaksson@medsci.uu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Akademiska sjukhuset ing61 3tr!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75185!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM402nnn/GSM402797/suppl/GSM402797.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16092!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity#BAF = B allele frequency!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BAFSNP_A-1780270	-0.13576	-0.0033431SNP_A-1780272	0.54051	0.35495SNP_A-1780285	0.19872	NaNSNP_A-1780286	-0.38489	0.56148SNP_A-1780287	-0.20656	0.014345SNP_A-1780289	0.38978	1.0389SNP_A-1780292	0.36432	1.2974SNP_A-1780294	-0.46352	0.99348SNP_A-1780295	-0.2775	1.0291SNP_A-1780300	0.2967	NaNSNP_A-1780302	0.35303	-0.025117SNP_A-1780303	0.33083	NaNSNP_A-1780304	0.73448	0.46811SNP_A-1780305	-0.1761	0.39409SNP_A-1780311	0.18545	-0.023305SNP_A-1780312	-0.44321	1.0508SNP_A-1780313	0.39621	0.5015SNP_A-1780316	-0.13203	0.94394SNP_A-1780318	0.10018	NaNSNP_A-1780320	-0.066512	1.0084!sample_table_end
