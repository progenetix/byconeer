The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Anders,,Isaksson!Sample_contact_email = anders.isaksson@medsci.uu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Akademiska sjukhuset ing61 3tr!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75185!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM402nnn/GSM402763/suppl/GSM402763.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16092!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity#BAF = B allele frequency!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BAFSNP_A-1780270	-0.090315	0.6336SNP_A-1780272	0.24585	1.0035SNP_A-1780285	0.22508	NaNSNP_A-1780286	0.0078128	0.63254SNP_A-1780287	0.42165	-0.044068SNP_A-1780289	0.13882	1.0105SNP_A-1780292	0.44113	1.1182SNP_A-1780294	0.075605	0.94067SNP_A-1780295	0.38078	1.1443SNP_A-1780300	-0.26156	NaNSNP_A-1780302	0.088321	0.16573SNP_A-1780303	0.24752	NaNSNP_A-1780304	0.37342	0.63048SNP_A-1780305	-0.18494	0.014604SNP_A-1780311	-0.2903	0.050771SNP_A-1780312	0.14992	-0.0028606SNP_A-1780313	0.24494	-0.020642SNP_A-1780316	0.037174	1.1856SNP_A-1780318	0.016765	NaNSNP_A-1780320	0.0049061	0.99408!sample_table_end
