The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Anders,,Isaksson!Sample_contact_email = anders.isaksson@medsci.uu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Akademiska sjukhuset ing61 3tr!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75185!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM402nnn/GSM402779/suppl/GSM402779.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16092!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity#BAF = B allele frequency!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BAFSNP_A-1780270	-0.095729	-0.030877SNP_A-1780272	0.19208	1.0104SNP_A-1780285	-0.014386	NaNSNP_A-1780286	-0.17683	0.53264SNP_A-1780287	0.047986	-0.074376SNP_A-1780289	0.17186	1.0205SNP_A-1780292	-0.055419	0.841SNP_A-1780294	-0.016136	0.43647SNP_A-1780295	-0.14586	0.52044SNP_A-1780300	-0.042333	NaNSNP_A-1780302	0.43849	-0.039735SNP_A-1780303	0.11595	NaNSNP_A-1780304	0.26885	0.38156SNP_A-1780305	-0.12846	1.0406SNP_A-1780311	0.010403	0.074188SNP_A-1780312	-0.25468	0.70024SNP_A-1780313	0.28877	0.61392SNP_A-1780316	-0.036037	0.89314SNP_A-1780318	-0.089029	NaNSNP_A-1780320	-0.11076	0.95386!sample_table_end
