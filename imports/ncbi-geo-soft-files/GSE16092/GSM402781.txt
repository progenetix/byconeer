The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Anders,,Isaksson!Sample_contact_email = anders.isaksson@medsci.uu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Akademiska sjukhuset ing61 3tr!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75185!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM402nnn/GSM402781/suppl/GSM402781.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16092!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity#BAF = B allele frequency!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BAFSNP_A-1780270	0.53813	0.55103SNP_A-1780272	-0.059092	1.0368SNP_A-1780285	-0.16004	NaNSNP_A-1780286	0.079421	0.53116SNP_A-1780287	0.10172	-0.038843SNP_A-1780289	-0.41928	1.024SNP_A-1780292	0.10413	0.7137SNP_A-1780294	0.20413	0.16315SNP_A-1780295	0.047221	0.97827SNP_A-1780300	-0.15396	NaNSNP_A-1780302	0.51058	-0.03591SNP_A-1780303	-0.10956	NaNSNP_A-1780304	0.0088327	-0.020307SNP_A-1780305	-0.44002	0.44254SNP_A-1780311	-0.05791	-0.13988SNP_A-1780312	-0.14796	0.23773SNP_A-1780313	-0.18687	0.45885SNP_A-1780316	0.11979	0.80861SNP_A-1780318	-0.15968	NaNSNP_A-1780320	0.013037	0.40776!sample_table_end
