The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Anders,,Isaksson!Sample_contact_email = anders.isaksson@medsci.uu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Akademiska sjukhuset ing61 3tr!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75185!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM402nnn/GSM402764/suppl/GSM402764.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16092!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity#BAF = B allele frequency!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BAFSNP_A-1780270	-0.018067	-0.066701SNP_A-1780272	0.1065	1.0061SNP_A-1780285	0.12731	NaNSNP_A-1780286	-0.011525	0.51813SNP_A-1780287	-0.082858	-0.10722SNP_A-1780289	-0.015606	1.0133SNP_A-1780292	-0.04687	0.92431SNP_A-1780294	-0.047217	1.0556SNP_A-1780295	-0.18732	1.0424SNP_A-1780300	0.13376	NaNSNP_A-1780302	0.00014775	0.035371SNP_A-1780303	-0.015196	NaNSNP_A-1780304	0.52686	0.58593SNP_A-1780305	-0.0021974	-0.0050613SNP_A-1780311	-0.40268	0.017586SNP_A-1780312	0.15252	0.40918SNP_A-1780313	0.22835	0.54666SNP_A-1780316	0.15209	1.1226SNP_A-1780318	0.11302	NaNSNP_A-1780320	-0.02181	0.95923!sample_table_end
