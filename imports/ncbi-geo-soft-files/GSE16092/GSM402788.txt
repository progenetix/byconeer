The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Anders,,Isaksson!Sample_contact_email = anders.isaksson@medsci.uu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Akademiska sjukhuset ing61 3tr!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75185!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM402nnn/GSM402788/suppl/GSM402788.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16092!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity#BAF = B allele frequency!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BAFSNP_A-1780270	0.066646	0.52026SNP_A-1780272	-0.076749	0.96892SNP_A-1780285	0.12115	NaNSNP_A-1780286	0.21266	0.56888SNP_A-1780287	0.064962	-0.0051904SNP_A-1780289	0.51003	0.93739SNP_A-1780292	-0.14576	1.2SNP_A-1780294	-0.32855	0.80127SNP_A-1780295	0.042133	0.9637SNP_A-1780300	-0.35224	NaNSNP_A-1780302	0.020666	1.0341SNP_A-1780303	-0.39559	NaNSNP_A-1780304	0.41787	0.49429SNP_A-1780305	-0.077632	1.0159SNP_A-1780311	-0.21804	-0.26656SNP_A-1780312	-0.29987	0.022343SNP_A-1780313	0.54453	-0.028166SNP_A-1780316	-0.19086	1.0589SNP_A-1780318	-0.071147	NaNSNP_A-1780320	0.98745	-0.26367!sample_table_end
