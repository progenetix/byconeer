The precipitated DNA was dissolved in 40 Âµl hybridization  mix. The probe mixture was denatured at 75 â¦C for 5 min and incubated at 37 â¦C for 60 min for blocking of repetitive sequences. The arrays were prehybridized with salmon sperm DNA to reduce non-specific back-ground staining. The probe mixture was applied to the array. The arrays were placed in a moist chamber at 37 â¦C for 72 h for hybridization. The array slides were washed twice in 2 Ã standard saline citrate (2 ÃSSC), 50% formamide, pH 7.0, at 45 â¦C. Then the array slides were washed well in phosphate buffer with 0.1% NP-40, pH 8.0, in 2 Ã SSC at room temperature.!Sample_scan_protocol = After hybridization, the slides were scanned on a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA, USA) and the 16-bit TIFF images were captured using GenePix Pro 5.0 software. The fluorescence images were analyzed using a software (MacViewer, Macrogen Inc.) optimized for analysis of the array. The fluorescence spots were defined using the automatic grid feature and adjusted manually.!Sample_description = without PCR!Sample_data_processing = Then the ratio of the green:red channel of each clone was calculated and all CGH ratios were converted to log base 2 (log2 ratios). The clones with log2 ratios that exceeded Â± 0.25 were considered gain and loss of the copy number.!Sample_data_processing = Because the chromosomal region showing high-level gain often contain an important oncogene, the high-level gain was marked and defined a log2 (green/red) ratio >1.0 as an amplification.!Sample_data_processing = In order to define chromosomal regions with DCNAs, the adaptive weights smoothing (AWS) procedure with the gain and loss analysis of DNA (GLAD) algorithm was applied to the ratio data.!Sample_platform_id = GPL10538!Sample_contact_name = Atsunori,,Oga!Sample_contact_fax = +81-836-22-2223!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Yamaguchi University!Sample_contact_address = Minami-Kogushi 1-1-1!Sample_contact_city = Ube!Sample_contact_state = Yamaguchi!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 7558505!Sample_contact_country = Japan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM555nnn/GSM555886/suppl/GSM555886_S2_G.txt.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM555nnn/GSM555886/suppl/GSM555886_S2_R.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE22328!Sample_data_row_count = 4095#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 (green/red), i.e., log2 (ACC/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	11	12	13	14	15	16	17	18	19	20	!sample_table_end
