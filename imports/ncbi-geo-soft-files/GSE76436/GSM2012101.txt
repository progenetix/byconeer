OG500 saliva kits collected from adults were extracted using Puregene chemistry on an AutopureLS automated DNA extractor. Saliva lysates were RNase a treated prior to extracting using either a 5.0ml or 2.5ml lysate protocol depending on collected saliva volume. OG575 saliva kits collected from children were extracted manually using same Puregene chemistry and RNase A treatment. Pelleted DNA was rehydrated in TE overnight and quantitated next day using Hoescht dye and FLX800 Flurometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to the array at 50C for 17 hours according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The array was washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = proband!Sample_data_processing = To achieve comprehensive CNV calling, we used four separate algorithms to detect CNVs; Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS), iPattern, Nexus and Partek.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, and NoCall!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Stephen,W,Scherer!Sample_contact_email = stephen.scherer@sickkids.ca!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Genomic Biology!Sample_contact_institute = The Hospital for Sick Children!Sample_contact_address = 686 Bay Street!Sample_contact_city = Toronto!Sample_contact_state = Ontario!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = M5G 0A4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2012nnn/GSM2012101/suppl/GSM2012101_1347.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2012nnn/GSM2012101/suppl/GSM2012101_1347.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2012nnn/GSM2012101/suppl/GSM2012101_1347.cyhd.cychp.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE76436!Sample_series_id = GSE76438!Sample_data_row_count = 0
