Leucocyte DNA was extracted with the Roche DNA isolation kit for mammalian blood. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP6!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Command Console Scan Controle 3.2.3.1515. Affymetrix Genotyping Console 4.0 (default parameters) was used to extract from CEL files, for each marker (SNPs and copy number markers), the DNA copy number (Log2Ratio) and the copy number state, and for each SNP, the signal intensities of alleles A and B and genotype calls. With this information, chromsomomal segments gained, lost or with copy-neutral LOH were detected automatically using SOMATICs (AssiÃ© et al, 2007) adapted for Affymetrix (AssiÃ© et al, 2013) in R. SOMATICs also specifies the comptarment (somatic or germline) for each alteration observed in the tumor, whether the paired leucocyte is available or not.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description: Pos_GRCh36: physical position provided in the built 36 of the Genome Reference Consortium Human genome; Log2Ratio: normalized DNA copy number in Log2 scale; Genotype: AA AB BB NoCall; Signal A: signal intensity of allele A; Signal B: signal intensity of allele B; BAF (B-allele frequency): normalized quantification of the allelic ratio, ranging from 0 for AA,  to 0.5 for AB SNPs without LOH, and to 1 for BB genotypes (generated by SOMATICs)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Guillaume,,AssiÃ©!Sample_contact_email = guillaume.assie@inserm.fr!Sample_contact_phone = +33158411820!Sample_contact_fax = +33158411905!Sample_contact_laboratory = J Bertherat's team!Sample_contact_department = Endocrinology Metabolism Cancer!Sample_contact_institute = Institut Cochin!Sample_contact_address = 24 rue du Fg Saint Jacques!Sample_contact_city = PARIS!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75014!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1034nnn/GSM1034025/suppl/GSM1034025_H9L_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE42171!Sample_data_row_count = 1805293
