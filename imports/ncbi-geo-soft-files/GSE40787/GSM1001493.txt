Frozen tissues were homogenized by rotor-stator directly in RLT+.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = The fragmented PCR products are labeled with a single biotin at each free 3'OH using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and a dideoxy biotinylated nucleoside triphosphate.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The biotinylated fragments are added to a hybridization solution containing a biotinylated control oligonucletide (for quality control), and hybridized to a microarray chip overnight at 49Â°C.!Sample_scan_protocol = The chips are then transferred to a fluidics instrument that performs washes to remove DNA that has not hybridized to its complementary oligonucleotide probe. The bound DNA is then fluorescently labeled using phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (SAPE) followed by biotinylated anti-streptavidin, followed by SAPE. Each DNA bound at its complementary oligonucleotide is excited using a confocal laser scanner, and the positions and intensities of the fluorescent emissions are captured.!Sample_description = Standard ovarian cancer cell line-250KSty!Sample_data_processing = CEL files and TXT files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by dChip and model-based expression performed using the PM/MM model.
