Frozen tissues were homogenized by rotor-stator directly in RLT+.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = The fragmented PCR products are labeled with a single biotin at each free 3'OH using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and a dideoxy biotinylated nucleoside triphosphate.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The biotinylated fragments are added to a hybridization solution containing a biotinylated control oligonucletide (for quality control), and hybridized to a microarray chip overnight at 49Â°C.!Sample_scan_protocol = The chips are then transferred to a fluidics instrument that performs washes to remove DNA that has not hybridized to its complementary oligonucleotide probe. The bound DNA is then fluorescently labeled using phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (SAPE) followed by biotinylated anti-streptavidin, followed by SAPE. Each DNA bound at its complementary oligonucleotide is excited using a confocal laser scanner, and the positions and intensities of the fluorescent emissions are captured.!Sample_description = Standard ovarian cancer cell line-250KSty!Sample_data_processing = CEL files and TXT files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by dChip and model-based expression performed using the PM/MM model. Invariant set normalization was performed as described in Lee and Wong, Genome Biology 2001, 2(8).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tan,A,Ince!Sample_contact_email = Tince@med.miami.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 305-243-1782!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Ince Lab - TCC!Sample_contact_department = Sylvester Cancer Center!Sample_contact_institute = University of Miami - Miller School of Medicine!Sample_contact_address = 1501 NW 10th Avenue, Rm 926!Sample_contact_city = Miami!Sample_contact_state = FL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 33136!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1001nnn/GSM1001485/suppl/GSM1001485_Caov-3.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1001nnn/GSM1001485/suppl/GSM1001485_Caov-3.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE40787!Sample_series_id = GSE40788!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.001873	AB	-0.105616	11.673062AFFX-2315061	AA	0.041525	AA	0.841618	10.252810AFFX-2315062	AA	0.020848	AA	0.605188	9.507952AFFX-2315057	AB	0.007425	AB	-0.158048	10.243094AFFX-2315058	AA	0.141463	AA	0.721818	11.693819AFFX-2315059	AB	0.045378	AB	0.433077	10.251415AFFX-2315063	AA	0.015328	AA	0.796852	9.851102AFFX-2315064	BB	0.032480	BB	-0.493261	8.983603AFFX-2315065	BB	0.057254	BB	-0.695717	10.028023AFFX-2315066	BB	0.077183	BB	-0.686049	9.443545AFFX-2315067	BB	0.002696	BB	-0.652805	10.673752AFFX-2315068	AA	0.046597	AA	0.860029	10.388433AFFX-2315069	AA	0.027722	AA	0.702307	9.452065AFFX-2315070	BB	0.108197	BB	-0.813672	10.305846AFFX-2315071	AA	0.009370	AA	0.743791	9.178543AFFX-2315072	AA	0.026500	AA	0.793356	10.684489AFFX-2315073	AA	0.077222	AA	0.692943	9.656680AFFX-2315074	BB	0.038317	BB	-0.676257	9.207987AFFX-2315075	AA	0.007163	AA	0.755567	10.872645AFFX-2315076	AB	0.003831	AB	0.012944	10.544654!sample_table_end
