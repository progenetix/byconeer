From each OCT block, 3x20 Âµm cuts were obtained using a microtome; the slices were washed twice in PBS and homogenized using the TissueLyser II (Qiagen). DNA extraction was performed using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen). From one of the patients (H380) a peripheral blood sample was included as a normal control sample (BB39). Mononuclear cells were isolated from the blood sample by Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Health Care, Uppsala, Sweden) and stored in 10 % DMSO and 20 % serum at â 80 oC. For DNA extraction, the cells were thawed, washed twice in PBS and genomic DNA extracted using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen). The DNA was eluted in water and the concentration measured using a Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific)!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = The SNP6.0 CEL files were imported in Genotyping Console version 4.1 (Affymetrix) and copy number/LOH analysis performed using regional GC correction and the CN baseline file generated from 270 HapMap samples; GenomeWideSNP_6.hapmap270.na32.r1.a5.ref (downloaded from Affymetrix webpage). Individual SNPs were not assessed. The resulting CNCHP-files were viewed using the software; Chromosome Analysis Suite, version 1.1 (Affymetrix). TXT files of normalized data were exported from the Chromosome Analysis Suite software. All genomic positions were annotated to the hg19 version of the human genome (NCBI build 37).!Sample_data_processing = Detection of CNVs larger than 200 kb with size being the only restriction.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Julie,StÃ¸ve,BÃ¸dker!Sample_contact_email = j.boedker@rn.dk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Research Laboratory!Sample_contact_department = Department of Heamatology!Sample_contact_institute = Aalborg University Hospital!Sample_contact_address = Sdr.
