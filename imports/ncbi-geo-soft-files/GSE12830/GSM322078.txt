Briefly, DNA was labelled with 1.5 - 3 mM Cy3-dUTP (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, USA), and purified using a Centricon YM-30 filter (Millipore, Billerica, USA). !Sample_hyb_protocol = Probe mixture of Cy3-labelled sample DNA, Cy5-labelled reference DNA, 50 Î¼l of 1.0mg/ ml of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, USA), 52 Î¼l of Agilent 10X Blocking Agent and 260 Î¼l of Agilent 2X Hybridization Buffer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) was denatured at 100C for 1 minute 30 seconds and incubated at 37C for 30 minutes. The probe was applied to the array using an Agilent microarray hybridization chamber, and hybridized for 40 hours at 65C in a rotating oven (Robbins Scientific, Sunnyvale, USA) at 20 rpm. Arrays were washed according to the manufacturerâs recommendation and air dried.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned using an Agilent 2565AA DNA microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies, Inc).!Sample_description = The Agilent Human Genome CGH microarray 244A (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, USA) were used for the array-CGH experiments. Three Î¼g of Human Genomic DNA from multiple anonymous male donors (Promega Corporation, Madison, USA) and 3 Î¼g of test genomic DNA sample were digested with AluI (5 units) and RsaI (5 units) (Promega) for a minimum of 2 hours at 37C. Digestion quality was assessed by the DNA 1000 LabChip Kit (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, Agilent Technologies). Labelling reactions were performed using the Agilent Genomic DNA Labeling Kit PLUS (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, USA) according to the manufacturerâs directions. Briefly, the reference and sample DNA were labelled with 1.5 - 3 mM Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, USA), and purified using a Centricon YM-30 filter (Millipore, Billerica, USA). Probe mixture of Cy3-labelled sample DNA, Cy5-labelled reference DNA, 50 Î¼l of 1.0mg/ ml of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, USA), 52 Î¼l of Agilent 10X Blocking Agent and 260 Î¼l of Agilent 2X Hybridization Buffer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) was denatured at 100C for 1 minute 30 seconds and incubated at 37C for 30 minutes. The probe was applied to the array using an Agilent microarray hybridization chamber, and hybridized for 40 hours at 65C in a rotating oven (Robbins Scientific, Sunnyvale, USA) at 20 rpm. Arrays were washed according to the manufacturerâs recommendations; air dried, and scanned using an Agilent 2565AA DNA microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies, Inc), and processed using Agilentâs Feature Extraction software. Dye-swapped duplicate experiments were carried out.!Sample_data_processing = Data were processed using Agilentâs Feature Extraction software protocol for array-CGH data. To analyze genomic imbalance tumour samples (2 arrays each) the  processed R signal and processed G signal columns from the Agilent  Feature Extraction-generated a-CGH .txt files were imported into PGS.  The tumour-specific signal across all probes was normalized as a ratio  to baseline using Normalise to Baseline Tool in PGS, where baseline  data corresponded to the normal human DNA. The data was then log2  transformed using the PGS Normalization and Scaling Tool. In order to  detect regions of genomic gain and loss we applied the Genomic  Segmentation tool with segmentation parameters set at: min. probes:  10, p-value threshold: 0.01, and signal to noise: 0.1. Region report  was set at values bellow -.5/+.5 (log2) and p-value threshold of 0.05  for 2/2 (replicate) arrays in individual analysis or at 40% cut-off in  cumulative analysis (i.e. 4/10 tumour samples). Regions of significant  gain or loss were annotated to the corresponding genes present on the  Affymetrix Gene 1.0 Array using the  HuGene-1_0-st-v1.na24.hg18.transcript.csv file. Visualizations and  VENN analysis were performed in PGS.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Bekim,,Sadikovic!Sample_contact_email = bsadikov@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = The SickKids Hospital and Princess Margaret Hospital!Sample_contact_address = 555 University Avenue!Sample_contact_city = Toronto!Sample_contact_state = Ontario!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = M5G 1X8!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322078/suppl/GSM322078.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12830!Sample_series_id = GSE12885!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 (cancer/normal)#gProcessedSignal = g chanel value#rProcessedSignal = r chanel value!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	gProcessedSignal	rProcessedSignal1	-5.87E-03	6.80E+03	6.71E+032	0.00E+00	1.59E+01	2.09E+013	0.00E+00	1.56E+01	2.05E+014	2.73E-03	8.01E+02	8.06E+025	1.72E-01	5.58E+02	8.30E+026	-8.07E-03	8.46E+02	8.31E+027	1.08E-01	9.47E+02	1.21E+038	1.68E-02	7.38E+02	7.67E+029	3.57E-02	1.05E+03	1.14E+0310	3.48E-01	2.37E+02	5.29E+0211	4.60E-02	1.40E+03	1.56E+0312	8.72E-02	7.66E+02	9.37E+0213	-1.77E-02	1.29E+03	1.24E+0314	2.07E-02	8.31E+02	8.71E+0215	-2.59E-04	1.52E+03	1.52E+0316	-7.20E-03	6.47E+02	6.36E+0217	-1.51E-02	1.22E+03	1.18E+0318	-1.08E+00	6.41E+02	5.28E+0119	7.38E-02	5.59E+02	6.63E+0220	-9.29E-02	7.33E+02	5.92E+02!sample_table_end
