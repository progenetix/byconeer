To overcome potential wave bias due to differences in GC-content of the different chromosomal regions, a smoothing algorithm was applied on our dataset as described by van de Wiel et al, Bioinformatics 2009; 25(9):1099-1104.!Sample_data_processing = The data analysis method used employs across array CGH comparisons (as described in Buffart et al.). In short, using across array CGH it is possible to digitally swap dye channels, allowing one to hybridize 2 different samples to one array and use the reference in another array (either present on the same array slide or even on a different slide) for comparison. Therefore, some of the raw data files are duplicated between Samples, and the appendix (e.g. Cy3_test, Cy3_ref, Cy5_test, Cy5_ref) refers to the label and channel used in each raw data file..!Sample_platform_id = GPL8693!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM746nnn/GSM746808/suppl/GSM746808_US22502676_251901510359_S01_CGH_105_Dec08_1_1_Cy3_ref_2.txt.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM746nnn/GSM746808/suppl/GSM746808_US22502676_251901510359_S01_CGH_105_Dec08_1_2_Cy5_test.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30155!Sample_data_row_count = 98637#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (test/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE4	0.5755	0.2556	0.2177	0.2078	-0.3119	0.37710	-0.21611	0.18412	-0.31613	-0.05714	0.21915	0.24916	0.09517	0.23718	0.71920	-0.20722	0.31823	-0.26724	0.16925	0.81!sample_table_end
