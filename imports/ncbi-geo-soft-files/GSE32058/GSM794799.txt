Tissue was homogenised in 6 mL of Nucleic Lysis Buffer then incubated at 37C overnight following the addition of Proteinase K (2 mg) and 200 Î¼L 20% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). The next day, 2 mL of saturated salt solution were added and samples shaken vigorously for 1 min before centrifugation for 1 hour 45 minutes at 9,500 x g at 4C. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes and five volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol added to precipitate DNA. A brief centrifugation for 30 seconds at 9,500 x g loosely pelleted DNA to enable removal of supernatants. DNA was then washed twice in ice- cold 70% ethanol (v/v, in water) followed by centrifugation for 2 minutes at 9,500 x g at 4C. Pellets were air-dried and resuspended in 0.5-1.0 mL of TE buffer (Appendix 1, page 288). DNA was quantified by agarose gel electrophoresis and A260/A280 spectrophotometry. High molecular weight genomic DNA was purified using a Blood and Cell Culture mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = For each aCGH microarray, a tumour sample (test) was compared with a commercially available Female Genomic DNA (Promega) (reference). High molecular weight genomic DNA (0.8 Î¼g) was digested with AluI (20 units) and RsaI (20 units) (Invitrogen Corporation) in a total volume of 13.33 Î¼L for 2 hours at 37C followed by heat inactivation at 65C for 10 minutes. Adequacy of digestion was verified by running 0.4 Î¼L of sample on a 1.5% agarose gel using a 1X SYBR Gold nucleic acid gel stain (Invitrogen Corporation) as described in section 2.3.1. The remaining digestion reaction was labelled using a Bioprime labelling kit (Invitrogen Corporation) according to the manufacturer's instructions in a final volume of 50 al with a modified dNTP pool containing 120 aM each of dATP, dGTP, and dCTP; 60 aM dTTP; and 60 aM Cy5-dUTP (test) or Cy3-dUTP (reference) (Amersham/GE Healthcare).!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Female genomic DNA!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = reference: Female Genomic DNA (Promega)!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = A total of 300-500 mg of frozen tissue was rotor-homogenised (Polytron PT2100) and genomic DNA extracted using a salt-precipitation method or phenol chloroform method.

The hybridisation mix was denatured at 100C for 3 minutes, incubated at 37C for 30 minutes, then centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 1 minute before loading onto a Human Genome CGH Microarray 44B (Agilent Technologies Inc.). Hybridisation was performed for 48 hours at 65Â°C in a rotating oven at 10 rpm. Arrays were disassembled and washed for 5 minutes at room temperature in aCGH Wash Buffer 1 (Appendix 1, page 288) followed by 15 minutes at 37C in aCGH Wash Buffer 2 (Appendix 1, page 288). Arrays were then briefly rinsed in acetonitrile followed by Stabilization and Drying Reagent (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) before being dried and scanned in an Agilent microarray scanner.!Sample_scan_protocol = Images were quantified using Agilent Feature Extraction Software (version A.8.5.1.1).!Sample_description = Ag__251328213302_S01_44k_CGH.txt!Sample_data_processing = Agilent Feature Extraction Software (v 8.5.1.1) was used for background subtraction and LOWESS normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2879!Sample_contact_name = Krishna,Bajee,Sriram!Sample_contact_email = bajee.sriram@uqconnect.edu.au!Sample_contact_phone = +61 7 31394110!Sample_contact_laboratory = UQ Thoracic Research Laboratory!Sample_contact_department = Department of Thoracic Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = The Prince Charles Hospital!Sample_contact_address = Rode Road, Chermside!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_state = Queensland!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4032!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM794nnn/GSM794799/suppl/GSM794799.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE32058!Sample_data_row_count = 42920#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio (Cy3/Cy5) test/reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE3	7.21E-014	-1.54E-015	4.09E-026	6.01E-027	-2.07E-018	5.18E-029	-4.38E-0110	-1.51E-0111	-3.72E-0112	1.04E-0113	-9.37E-0214	-8.24E-0115	1.12E-0116	-3.85E-0117	-5.55E-0118	-3.62E-0119	-1.18E-0120	-2.53E-0121	-1.02E-0122	6.51E-01!sample_table_end
