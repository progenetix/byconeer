Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378144/suppl/GSM378144.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15131!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	3.970215420e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	1.597096531e-0025	5.786971133e-0026	-7.930988893e-0027	1.954125389e-0018	1.652344655e-0019	5.828491808e-00210	-2.143468954e-00111	1.210890218e-00112	1.800675444e-00113	-1.068774012e-00114	-6.952022421e-00215	1.249333959e-00116	-3.551131963e-00317	3.557169914e-00218	-4.991617292e-00119	-6.264229933e-00220	5.056317110e-003!sample_table_end
