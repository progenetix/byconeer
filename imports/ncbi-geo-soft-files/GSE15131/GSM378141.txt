Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378141/suppl/GSM378141.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15131!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	-5.526804664e-0022	-2.888845935e-0013	0.000000000e+0004	4.591393814e-0025	5.838609625e-0026	-1.957858549e-0017	2.618487832e-0018	-3.464667345e-0029	1.677679799e-00110	-1.302881629e-00111	4.858483170e-00112	1.897073013e-00113	1.457849476e-00214	-1.794702442e-00215	4.066310445e-00116	-2.551464337e-00117	1.686050694e-00118	1.263033234e-00119	-2.192535789e-00420	1.289478239e-001!sample_table_end
