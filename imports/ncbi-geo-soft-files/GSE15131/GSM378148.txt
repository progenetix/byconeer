Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378148/suppl/GSM378148.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15131!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	-1.430479817e-0012	0.000000000e+0003	-1.189621770e-0014	-3.068031722e-0015	7.545020028e-0026	-2.963884291e-0027	3.197691518e-0018	2.356376845e-0019	5.957218796e-00210	0.000000000e+00011	-8.036838147e-00212	-8.516433483e-00213	-4.114636986e-00214	-1.657646147e-00115	-2.193374122e-00216	3.203812876e-00217	-1.127019186e-00118	-9.090042514e-00219	1.343190614e-00120	1.606590064e-001!sample_table_end
