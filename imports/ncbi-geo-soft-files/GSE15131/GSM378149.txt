Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378149/suppl/GSM378149.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15131!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	-4.018760221e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	2.585205074e-0025	1.675202510e-0016	1.948699812e-0017	3.712118467e-0018	7.652637204e-0029	2.477530756e-00110	-7.005648872e-00211	-2.848025716e-00212	8.421064112e-00213	-8.474232004e-00214	3.235496567e-00215	9.088440668e-00316	1.782008645e-00117	-2.955663196e-00218	1.361088986e-00119	2.377584159e-00220	1.706841174e-001!sample_table_end
