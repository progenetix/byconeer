Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378146/suppl/GSM378146.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15131!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	-1.717983120e-0012	0.000000000e+0003	2.582523901e-0014	-5.747622233e-0025	1.474584140e-0016	-1.309329834e-0017	2.732246846e-0028	-2.208658235e-0029	1.682032186e-00110	-1.635405455e-00111	2.076559489e-00112	1.070177813e+00013	1.140249182e-00114	8.370602441e-00215	6.331637658e-00216	-2.663905672e-00117	-2.559523264e-00118	-3.164010429e-00119	-1.145817146e-00120	2.281529473e-001!sample_table_end
