Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378152/suppl/GSM378152.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15131!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	-9.594005595e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	6.199166082e-0014	-1.934241191e-0015	-1.455778263e-0016	-1.111628011e-0017	2.450587230e-0018	3.339225401e-0019	2.047197270e-00110	0.000000000e+00011	-3.904626123e-00112	-2.281646095e-00113	-1.259356598e-00114	-2.484916076e-00215	1.192576831e-00216	-6.752768692e-00217	-9.333429317e-00218	-7.662125113e-00219	-9.518116671e-00220	-1.342288972e-002!sample_table_end
