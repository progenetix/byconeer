Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378143/suppl/GSM378143.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15131!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	2.084710707e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	1.103110120e-0014	2.012082983e-0035	2.632521053e-0026	-1.765683117e-0027	2.280055646e-0028	-7.881298609e-0029	2.891215785e-00110	-8.359025725e-00111	1.073701506e-00112	1.317010102e-00113	3.102739836e-00214	2.778387961e-00215	5.904442979e-00216	-1.945618557e-00117	3.516332206e-00218	2.264921028e-00219	5.426185110e-00220	-3.041795362e-003!sample_table_end
