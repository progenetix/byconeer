Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378142/suppl/GSM378142.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15131!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	-7.234015930e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	4.787689589e-0035	-6.569494468e-0026	-1.127445786e-0017	2.059377612e-0018	2.316763793e-0019	3.312471449e-00110	-7.706800742e-00211	7.885142753e-00212	1.159155272e-00113	7.313251880e-00214	-1.983294852e-00415	6.776874113e-00216	9.259606602e-00317	-2.238148107e-00318	-1.074401489e-00119	-7.171770398e-00220	2.895311166e-002!sample_table_end
