Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378140/suppl/GSM378140.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15131!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	1.625931577e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	1.886891612e-0015	-1.017002076e-0026	2.022732480e-0047	1.598954472e-0018	-6.690227503e-0029	8.998129902e-00210	-2.761779569e-00111	1.811989449e-00112	3.145180846e-00113	-7.298246097e-00214	9.093646813e-00215	9.258269398e-00216	5.827656626e-00217	2.037877975e-00118	-8.010904728e-00219	-1.078646760e-00120	1.506389799e-001!sample_table_end
