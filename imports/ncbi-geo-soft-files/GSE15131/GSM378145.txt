Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378145/suppl/GSM378145.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15131!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	-2.918759791e-0022	-4.993782360e-0023	0.000000000e+0004	-3.707403386e-0035	3.695682163e-0036	1.699924711e-0017	7.462278340e-0028	-1.897582243e-0019	4.476728470e-00210	-1.517548763e-00111	-4.464940039e-00312	5.122936611e-00113	-4.872472928e-00214	1.290102732e-00115	2.738593143e-00116	-1.171478690e-00117	1.034397426e-00218	0.000000000e+00019	-2.616036619e-00120	5.967792065e-002!sample_table_end
