Z' scores >=2 were used to identify probable copy gains and Z' scores <= -2 were used to identify probable copy loss. Z' scores for the genes of interest are available on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeremy,Wayne,Hoog!Sample_contact_email = jhoog@wustl.edu!Sample_contact_laboratory = Dr. Matthew Ellis!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Washington University Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 660 S Euclid!Sample_contact_city = Saint Louis!Sample_contact_state = MO!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 63110!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM378nnn/GSM378147/suppl/GSM378147.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15131!Sample_series_id = GSE15134!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	-1.342780242e-0012	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	-3.431477566e-0015	-1.135891027e-0016	3.991886616e-0027	3.821567232e-0018	-1.205244430e-0019	9.894349518e-00310	0.000000000e+00011	2.264704758e-00112	-2.757817303e-00213	2.606696444e-00214	-4.900255883e-00315	2.765805245e-00116	5.053495726e-00117	9.848673036e-00218	-6.956396174e-00319	1.199112336e-00120	1.024338457e-001!sample_table_end
