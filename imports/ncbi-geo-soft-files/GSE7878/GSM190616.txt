After mixing by inversion the DNA was collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 g and 4Â°C, the supernatant aspirated and the pellet air-dried for approximately 5-10 min. The pellet was then dissolved in 13 Âµl Yeast tRNA (100 Âµg/Âµl, Invitrogen) and 26 Âµl 20% SDS taking care to prevent foam formation. After incubating at room temperature for 15 min 91 Âµl of Master mix (14.3 % (w/v) dextran sulphate (USB), 50% (v/v) formamide (Invitrogen), 2.9 X SSC pH 7.0 (Sigma)) was added and gently mixed. The hybridization solution was then incubated at 73Â°C for 10 min to denature the DNA and subsequently at 37Â°C for 60 min to allow the Cot-1 DNA to block repetitive sequences. Hybridization and washing was done automatically using a GeneTAC/HybArray12 hybstation (Genomic Solutions / Perkin Elmer). Hybridisation was for 38 h at 37Â°C. Subsequently slides were washed 6 cycles (flow for 10 s, hold for 20 s) with 50% (v/v) formamide, 2X SSC, 2 cycles with phosphate-buffer (0.1 M Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 0.1% (v/v) Igepal CA630 (Sigma)), 2 cycles with 0.2 X SSC (Sigma) and 2 cycles with 0.1 X SSC. Slides were then taken out of the hybstation and briefly rinsed in 0.01 X SSC, dried by centrifugation for 3 min at 1000 g and scanned using a Microarray Scanner G2505B (Agilent Technologies).!Sample_data_processing = Spot analysis and quality control was fully automated using BlueFuse version 3.1 (BlueGnome, Cambridge, UK). Spots were excluded when the quality flag was less than 1 or the Confidence value less than 0.1. Oligonucleotides from the human library were mapped to the human genome build NCBI35. Oligonucleotide sequences and mapping have been made accessible by Compugen (San Jose, CA, USA) and The Sanger Institute (Hinxton, Cambridge, UK), respectively, via www.ensembl.org. A unique chromosomal position was identified for 26845 of 28830 oligonucleotides in the human library. Oligonucleotides were excluded when they mapped to more than one position in the genome or showed one or more mismatches with regard to the current build. Log2ratios of spots that were not excluded after quality flagging and mapping were normalized to their mode value. Weighted moving average values were then calculated using a triangular function and a window of 250 kb as described (Barrett,M.T. et al. (2004)  Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A, 101, 17765-17770.).!Sample_platform_id = GPL2827!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM190nnn/GSM190616/suppl/GSM190616.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE7878!Sample_data_row_count = 30000#ID_REF = #AMPCH1 = Total signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#AMPCH2 = Total signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#LOG2RATIO CH1/CH2 = Log, base 2, of the ratio of total signal in channel 1 divided by total signal in channel 2#CONFIDENCE = The Confidence Estimate in the calculated ratio, between 0 and 1, calculated by BlueFuse#QUALITY = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (1 acceptable; 0 not acceptable), estimated by BlueFuse#VALUE = Mode normalized value of the log2ratio, replicates are fused by BlueFuse, features with confidenc < 0.1 or quality 0 are excluded#MOVING_AVERAGE = weighted moving average with a window of 250 kb!sample_table_beginID_REF	AMPCH1	AMPCH2	LOG2RATIO CH1/CH2	CONFIDENCE	QUALITY	VALUE	MOVING_AVERAGE1	1318.123	2176.684	-0.724	0.86	0		2	234.838	333.023	-0.504	0.75	0		3	271.068	361.567	-0.416	0.55	0		4	704.21	1248.283	-0.826	0.98	1	-0.374	-0.09155	1455.164	2638.041	-0.858	0.98	1	-0.406	-0.23156	679.969	1013.77	-0.576	0.98	1	-0.124	-0.1206666677	266.017	326.134	-0.294	0.68	1	0.158	0.0456666678	555.918	1026.97	-0.885	0.97	1	-0.433	-0.2646666679	125.714	247.525	-0.977	0.46	1	-0.525	-0.06866666710	290.934	558.609	-0.941	0.87	1	-0.489	-0.35733333311	303.92	411.837	-0.438	0.84	1	0.014	0.26933333312	552.149	933.666	-0.758	0.96	1	-0.306	-0.16766666713	286.017	437.413	-0.613	0.82	1	-0.161	-0.00114	591.913	504.054	0.232	0.92	1	0.684	0.19533333315	295.487	447.42	-0.599	0.85	1	-0.147	0.000516	352.178	511.748	-0.539	0.86	1	-0.087	0.03833333317	348.309	570.941	-0.713	0.9	1	-0.261	-0.25883333318	242.232	336.457	-0.474	0.73	1	-0.022	-0.05283333319	158.335	286.581	-0.856	0.58	1	-0.404	-0.18083333320	166.804	255.171	-0.613	0.12	1	-0.161	-0.0125!sample_table_end
