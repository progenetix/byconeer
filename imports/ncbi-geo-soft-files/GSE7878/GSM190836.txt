After mixing by inversion the DNA was collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 g and 4Â°C, the supernatant aspirated and the pellet air-dried for approximately 5-10 min. The pellet was then dissolved in 13 Âµl Yeast tRNA (100 Âµg/Âµl, Invitrogen) and 26 Âµl 20% SDS taking care to prevent foam formation. After incubating at room temperature for 15 min 91 Âµl of Master mix (14.3 % (w/v) dextran sulphate (USB), 50% (v/v) formamide (Invitrogen), 2.9 X SSC pH 7.0 (Sigma)) was added and gently mixed. The hybridization solution was then incubated at 73Â°C for 10 min to denature the DNA and subsequently at 37Â°C for 60 min to allow the Cot-1 DNA to block repetitive sequences. Hybridization and washing was done automatically using a GeneTAC/HybArray12 hybstation (Genomic Solutions / Perkin Elmer). Hybridisation was for 38 h at 37Â°C. Subsequently slides were washed 6 cycles (flow for 10 s, hold for 20 s) with 50% (v/v) formamide, 2X SSC, 2 cycles with phosphate-buffer (0.1 M Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 0.1% (v/v) Igepal CA630 (Sigma)), 2 cycles with 0.2 X SSC (Sigma) and 2 cycles with 0.1 X SSC. Slides were then taken out of the hybstation and briefly rinsed in 0.01 X SSC, dried by centrifugation for 3 min at 1000 g and scanned using a Microarray Scanner G2505B (Agilent Technologies).!Sample_data_processing = Spot analysis and quality control was fully automated using BlueFuse version 3.1 (BlueGnome, Cambridge, UK). Spots were excluded when the quality flag was less than 1 or the Confidence value less than 0.1. Oligonucleotides from the human library were mapped to the human genome build NCBI35. Oligonucleotide sequences and mapping have been made accessible by Compugen (San Jose, CA, USA) and The Sanger Institute (Hinxton, Cambridge, UK), respectively, via www.ensembl.org. A unique chromosomal position was identified for 26845 of 28830 oligonucleotides in the human library. Oligonucleotides were excluded when they mapped to more than one position in the genome or showed one or more mismatches with regard to the current build. Log2ratios of spots that were not excluded after quality flagging and mapping were normalized to their mode value. Weighted moving average values were then calculated using a triangular function and a window of 250 kb as described (Barrett,M.T. et al. (2004)  Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A, 101, 17765-17770.).!Sample_platform_id = GPL2827!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM190nnn/GSM190836/suppl/GSM190836.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE7878!Sample_data_row_count = 30000#ID_REF = #AMPCH1 = Total signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#AMPCH2 = Total signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#LOG2RATIO CH1/CH2 = Log, base 2, of the ratio of total signal in channel 1 divided by total signal in channel 2#CONFIDENCE = The Confidence Estimate in the calculated ratio, between 0 and 1, calculated by BlueFuse#QUALITY = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (1 acceptable; 0 not acceptable), estimated by BlueFuse#VALUE = Mode normalized value of the log2ratio, replicates are fused by BlueFuse, features with confidenc < 0.1 or quality 0 are excluded#MOVING_AVERAGE = weighted moving average with a window of 250 kb!sample_table_beginID_REF	AMPCH1	AMPCH2	LOG2RATIO CH1/CH2	CONFIDENCE	QUALITY	VALUE	MOVING_AVERAGE1	161.186	557.949	-1.791	0.96	1		2	245.969	1119.912	-2.187	0.94	1		3	63.987	173.048	-1.435	0.95	1		4	155.235	283.121	-0.867	0.96	1		5	422.99	1033.329	-1.289	0.98	1		6	470.371	1557.733	-1.728	0.91	1		7	769.803	3151.342	-2.033	0.96	1		8	1285.983	4984.486	-1.955	0.47	0		9	937.138	4066.997	-2.118	0.67	1		10	133.311	582.484	-2.127	0.86	1		11	877.121	3844.031	-2.132	0.67	1		12	734.222	2881.953	-1.973	0.77	1		13	351.914	1338.172	-1.927	0.76	1		14	322.643	1131.067	-1.81	0.83	1		15	45.473	151.66	-1.738	0.53	1		16	19.037	56.409	-1.567	0.2	1		17	56.344	112.024	-0.991	0.97	1		18	46.744	72.557	-0.634	0.2	1		19	16.948	46.085	-1.443	0.08	1		20	20.228	41.423	-1.034	0.07	1		!sample_table_end
