After mixing by inversion the DNA was collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 g and 4Â°C, the supernatant aspirated and the pellet air-dried for approximately 5-10 min. The pellet was then dissolved in 13 Âµl Yeast tRNA (100 Âµg/Âµl, Invitrogen) and 26 Âµl 20% SDS taking care to prevent foam formation. After incubating at room temperature for 15 min 91 Âµl of Master mix (14.3 % (w/v) dextran sulphate (USB), 50% (v/v) formamide (Invitrogen), 2.9 X SSC pH 7.0 (Sigma)) was added and gently mixed. The hybridization solution was then incubated at 73Â°C for 10 min to denature the DNA and subsequently at 37Â°C for 60 min to allow the Cot-1 DNA to block repetitive sequences. Hybridization and washing was done automatically using a GeneTAC/HybArray12 hybstation (Genomic Solutions / Perkin Elmer). Hybridisation was for 38 h at 37Â°C. Subsequently slides were washed 6 cycles (flow for 10 s, hold for 20 s) with 50% (v/v) formamide, 2X SSC, 2 cycles with phosphate-buffer (0.1 M Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 0.1% (v/v) Igepal CA630 (Sigma)), 2 cycles with 0.2 X SSC (Sigma) and 2 cycles with 0.1 X SSC. Slides were then taken out of the hybstation and briefly rinsed in 0.01 X SSC, dried by centrifugation for 3 min at 1000 g and scanned using a Microarray Scanner G2505B (Agilent Technologies).!Sample_data_processing = Spot analysis and quality control was fully automated using BlueFuse version 3.1 (BlueGnome, Cambridge, UK). Spots were excluded when the quality flag was less than 1 or the Confidence value less than 0.1. Oligonucleotides from the human library were mapped to the human genome build NCBI35. Oligonucleotide sequences and mapping have been made accessible by Compugen (San Jose, CA, USA) and The Sanger Institute (Hinxton, Cambridge, UK), respectively, via www.ensembl.org. A unique chromosomal position was identified for 26845 of 28830 oligonucleotides in the human library. Oligonucleotides were excluded when they mapped to more than one position in the genome or showed one or more mismatches with regard to the current build. Log2ratios of spots that were not excluded after quality flagging and mapping were normalized to their mode value. Weighted moving average values were then calculated using a triangular function and a window of 250 kb as described (Barrett,M.T. et al. (2004)  Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A, 101, 17765-17770.).!Sample_platform_id = GPL2827!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM190nnn/GSM190844/suppl/GSM190844.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE7878!Sample_data_row_count = 30000#ID_REF = #AMPCH1 = Total signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#AMPCH2 = Total signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#LOG2RATIO CH1/CH2 = Log, base 2, of the ratio of total signal in channel 1 divided by total signal in channel 2#CONFIDENCE = The Confidence Estimate in the calculated ratio, between 0 and 1, calculated by BlueFuse#QUALITY = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (1 acceptable; 0 not acceptable), estimated by BlueFuse#VALUE = Mode normalized value of the log2ratio, replicates are fused by BlueFuse, features with confidenc < 0.1 or quality 0 are excluded#MOVING_AVERAGE = weighted moving average with a window of 250 kb!sample_table_beginID_REF	AMPCH1	AMPCH2	LOG2RATIO CH1/CH2	CONFIDENCE	QUALITY	VALUE	MOVING_AVERAGE1	700.585	2072.687	-1.565	0.95	0		2	408.331	1574.82	-1.947	0.65	0		3	293.421	1190.866	-2.021	0.94	0		4	1625.76	4157.026	-1.354	0.98	0		5	2151.956	5532.878	-1.362	0.98	1	0.578	0.4126666676	1203.614	3570.248	-1.569	0.99	1	0.372	0.0211666677	208.71	889.511	-2.092	0.94	1	-0.151	-0.1806666678	837.471	2825.695	-1.754	0.98	1	0.186	-0.24159	164.358	670.314	-2.028	0.9	1	-0.088	0.2610	365.68	1417.42	-1.955	0.88	1	-0.014	-0.1911	218.14	942.869	-2.112	0.94	1	-0.172	-0.18612	676.074	2566.694	-1.925	0.97	1	0.015	0.20083333313	586.069	1187.298	-1.019	0.98	1	0.922	-0.03216666714	355.137	1715.988	-2.273	0.98	1	-0.332	0.01766666715	304.277	1382.649	-2.184	0.96	1	-0.244	-0.193516	250.274	1102.538	-2.139	0.96	1	-0.199	-0.05483333317	557.289	1470.754	-1.4	0.97	1	0.54	0.09066666718	594.598	1439.54	-1.276	0.98	1	0.665	0.112519	247.199	1015.567	-2.039	0.94	1	-0.098	0.05733333320	333.444	956.723	-1.521	0.96	1	0.42	-0.069166667!sample_table_end
