Mononuclear cells were incubated with anti-CD138 coated magnetic beads for tumor cell purification. Cells were washed from magnetic beads and genomic DNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) extraction techniques.  Further purification included treatment with Proteinase K and RNAse A and phenol-chloroform extraction.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Tumor DNA and DNA from a normal female reference (Promega, Madison, WI) were independently digested with Bovine DNAse I (Ambion, Austin, TX) and directly labeled with Cy5 and Cy3, respectively using the BioPrime Array CGH Genomic Labeling Module (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).!Sample_source_name_ch2 = CD138+ plasma cell genomic DNA!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = condition: Myeloma!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = NA!Sample_growth_protocol_ch2 = NA!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Tumor cells were isolated from 5-50cc bone aspirates and ACK lysis was used to lyse red blood cells.

Equal amounts of labeled, purified tumor and reference DNA were hybridized to the microarray in a rotary oven at 65oC for 40 hours at a rotation speed of 20 rpm.!Sample_scan_protocol = Slides were scanned with the Agilent G2505B scanner using the default settings.!Sample_data_processing = Scanner images were extracted using Feature Extraction software version 10.1(Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).  Log2 data was imported into Agilent DNA Analytics 4.0.81 software for visualization and quality assessment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Angela,Stewart,Baker!Sample_contact_email = abaker@tgen.org!Sample_contact_phone = 602-343-8828!Sample_contact_fax = 602-343-8840!Sample_contact_laboratory = Carpten Lab!Sample_contact_department = Division of Integrated Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_institute = Translational Genomics Research Institute!Sample_contact_address = 445 N.
