In all patients, bone marrow (BM) aspirates were collected at diagnosis and after 9 cycles of induction therapy. In brief, patients treatment consisted of bortezomib, melphalan, prednisone (VMP) and lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone (Rd), given in a sequential (n=21) or alternating (n=19) manner.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was digested with Nsp I and Sty I restriction enzymes, ligated to adapters with T4 DNA ligase and amplified. PCR products were concentrated and fragmented (DNAsal), and then end-labeled with deoxynucleotidil transferase!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Labelling and hybridizations were performed according to protocols from Affymetrix!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_data_processing = ChAS console from Affymetrix was used to assess genome wide copy number frequencies!Sample_data_processing = Weighted Log2 Ratios from ChAS console!Sample_platform_id = GPL18637!Sample_contact_name = Bruno,,Paiva!Sample_contact_email = bpaiva@unav.es!Sample_contact_institute = Clinica Universidad de Navarra!Sample_contact_address = Av.
