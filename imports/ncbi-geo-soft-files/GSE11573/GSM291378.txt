BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	401.5	354	642	265	0	0	-1.4047908722	421.5	359	797.5	317	0	0	-1.4047908723	406	349	880	344	0	0	-1.4047908724	578	356	1980.5	435	0		5	538	357	1900	434.5	0		6	610	396	2243	524	0		7	2590.5	391	7163.5	457.5	0	0	-0.0225613238	2520	337	7764	393	0	0	-0.0225613239	2277	328	6498	365	0	0	-0.02256132310	328	312.5	353	298	0		11	330	301	383	260	0		12	312	289.5	302	239	0		13	360.5	283	462	229	0	0	-0.10213172314	347	285	447	232.5	0	0	-0.10213172315	486	283	973	227	0	0	-0.10213172316	310	293	237	217	0		17	329	304.5	252.5	215	0		18	313	298	253.5	225	0		19	361.5	316	506.5	315	0	0	-0.22277723220	368.5	315	502	316	0	0	-0.222777232!sample_table_end
