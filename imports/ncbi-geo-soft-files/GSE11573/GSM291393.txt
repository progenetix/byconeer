BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	573.5	481	796.5	299.5	3	0	2	483	380.5	823	229.5	0	0	3	437	368.5	718.5	219.5	0	0	4	530	380.5	1352	270.5	0		5	553	365.5	1587.5	287	3		6	540	369	1642.5	272	0		7	5264.5	343	17806.5	220	0	0	-0.0181184318	5174	338	17797	217	0	0	-0.0181184319	5472.5	332	18681.5	214	0	0	-0.01811843110	350	340	221	191.5	0		11	363	337	246.5	193	0		12	345	329	230	195	0		13	349	323	288	196	0	0	0.11419668114	343	327	253	200	0	0	0.11419668115	353	332	264.5	201	0	0	0.11419668116	344	333	219.5	199	0		17	342	335	218	200	0		18	347.5	340	217.5	194.5	0		19	1064	340.5	2711	200	0	0	0.04053026420	960	344	2326	205	0	0	0.040530264!sample_table_end
