BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	998	214	1800	209.5	0	0	0.2036107552	980	211	2005.5	239	0	0	0.2036107553	809	207	1453	291	0	0	0.2036107554	335	214	959	323.5	3		5	374	211	1040.5	325	3		6	260	208.5	1082	298	3		7	3999	195.5	9919	235	0	0	-0.0572994958	4069	195	9754	235	0	0	-0.0572994959	3974	199	9556	218	0	0	-0.05729949510	236	202	267	200	0		11	249	205	289	201	0		12	217	204	247	210	2		13	2159	193.5	5310.5	207	0	0	-0.07163779714	2035	194	4742	210	0	0	-0.07163779715	2008.5	194	4746	220	0	0	-0.07163779716	210	195	240	223	0		17	209.5	198	251	229	0		18	204	199	257	239	2		19	1451	201.5	3084	240	0	0	-0.03533439320	1367	199	3022	246	0	0	-0.035334393!sample_table_end
