BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	587	341	892	262	0	0	0.9305583362	527	330	900	259	0	0	0.9305583363	555.5	326	993	273	0	0	0.9305583364	583	327	2044.5	352.5	3		5	575	313	1705	360.5	3		6	528	290.5	1706.5	355	3		7	4224	277	24330	271	0	0	-0.0753677948	4129.5	273	23005	258	0	0	-0.0753677949	4018.5	286	22250	269	0	0	-0.07536779410	359	296.5	440	232	0		11	357	297	421.5	227	0		12	362	298	411.5	221	0		13	775	291	2318	227	0	0	14	722	297	2165	240	0	0	15	869	305	1924	240	0	0	16	353.5	305	349	236	0		17	361	302	351	231.5	0		18	366	297	346.5	229	0		19	1361	281	4824	224	0	0	20	1625	279	8207	229	0	0	!sample_table_end
