BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	386	335	596	248	0	0	-0.9080045452	408	354	695	262	0	0	-0.9080045453	401	354	684.5	273	0	0	-0.9080045454	505.5	367.5	1351	326	0		5	558	374	1890	349	0		6	540.5	364	1936.5	339	0		7	3254.5	358	12736.5	312	0	0	-0.0343432158	3759.5	351	14666.5	345	0	0	-0.0343432159	3729	350	14949.5	350	0	0	-0.03434321510	376.5	351	376	323	0		11	369	354	339.5	315	0		12	372.5	350	336.5	304	0		13	496	346	933	301	0	0	14	414	354	515	311.5	0	0	15	391	366.5	411	332	0	0	16	379	371	369	335	0		17	392.5	368	388	349	0		18	374	369	364	347	3		19	781	375.5	2286	394.5	3	0	20	437	386	567	433	3	0	!sample_table_end
