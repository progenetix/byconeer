BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	489	304	890	246	0	0	0.7420794692	503	282	901.5	234	0	0	0.7420794693	510	276	1101	240	0	0	0.7420794694	528	293	1917	381	3		5	527	288	1684	389	3		6	495.5	285	1826	407	3		7	4619	268	25370	280.5	0	0	-0.0371776898	4430	258	24170	265	0	0	-0.0371776899	4619	258	26065	252	0	0	-0.03717768910	318	261	432	225	0		11	313	263.5	410	222	0		12	314	262	401	220	0		13	652.5	254	2240	212	0	0	14	1072.5	255	2438	205	0	0	15	1069	257	1643.5	206	0	0	16	312	267	326	209	0		17	305.5	263	323.5	213	0		18	313	266	351	224	0		19	1564	265.5	8516	232	0	0	20	1890.5	269	10020	237	3	0	!sample_table_end
