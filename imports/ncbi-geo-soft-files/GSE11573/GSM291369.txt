BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	662	355	914	303	3	0	2	680	341	996	235	3	0	3	391	345	617	233	3	0	4	525	346	1288	266	3		5	527	349.5	1128.5	282.5	3		6	398	353	1236.5	268	3		7	4859.5	345	9927	212	0	0	8	4076	347	9145	212	0	0	9	5476.5	329	8635	201	0	0	10	349	334	224	193.5	2		11	380	336	222	194	3		12	350	339	220	197	2		13	856	334	1189	192	0	0	14	710.5	332.5	913	194	3	0	15	724	330	921.5	194	3	0	16	348	336	211	195.5	2		17	342	335	207.5	198	2		18	334	326.5	205	197	2		19	362	338	239	203	2	0	20	693	329	688	194	3	0	!sample_table_end
