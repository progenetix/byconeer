BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	740.5	257	998.5	208	0	0	0.5054520412	703	251.5	849.5	202	0	0	0.5054520413	681	247	810.5	205.5	0	0	0.5054520414	408	248	1198	253	3		5	404	246	1164	259	3		6	389.5	240	1223	260	3		7	8420.5	235	19279	212	0	0	-0.101566278	8413.5	232	18287	201	0	0	-0.101566279	8151	224	17979	200	0	0	-0.1015662710	281.5	226	295	186	0		11	279	225	305.5	184	0		12	287.5	225	292	184	0		13	1392	219	2634	183	0	0	-0.03721387414	1430.5	218	2728	182	0	0	-0.03721387415	1518	219	3175	184	0	0	-0.03721387416	305.5	226	328	188	0		17	269	222	278	187	0		18	316	233	327.5	190	0		19	3111	233	6022	197	3	0	20	2659	235	3797	197	3	0	!sample_table_end
