BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	640	245	1126	195	0	0	0.957226082	559	239	885	194	0	0	0.957226083	614.5	241	1095	200	0	0	0.957226084	388	242	1132.5	238.5	0		5	394	248	1146.5	261.5	3		6	394	248	1155	267.5	3		7	5452	243	24052.5	231	0	0	-0.0632912028	5466.5	247	24874	233	0	0	-0.0632912029	5453	249.5	24777	236.5	0	0	-0.06329120210	294	252	354	209	0		11	298	247	322	189	0		12	298	251	350	195	0		13	1096	239	3686	190	0	0	0.118628414	970	236	3357	191	0	0	0.118628415	1068	234	3496	190	0	0	0.118628416	270	236	324	194	0		17	263	235	301	191	0		18	275.5	232	290	190	0		19	991.5	233	2661	188	0	0	20	1260	243.5	5096	197	0	0	!sample_table_end
