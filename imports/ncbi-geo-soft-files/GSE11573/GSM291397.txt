BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	648	570.5	837	352	3	0	2	592.5	475	970.5	262	0	0	3	473.5	425	535	241	0	0	4	583	390	1493	282	0		5	579	383	1491.5	298	0		6	562	361	1543	287	0		7	7035	337	26134	224	0	0	-0.0680520898	6685	338	25332	221.5	0	0	-0.0680520899	6850	340.5	25162	214	0	0	-0.06805208910	356	337	227.5	191	0		11	356	332	227	190	0		12	343	324	232.5	189.5	0		13	568	322	970	191	0	0	14	463.5	317	819.5	194	0	0	15	351	320	267	188	0	0	16	333	325	210	189.5	0		17	342.5	331	213.5	191.5	0		18	338	330	215.5	195	0		19	391	329	392	197	0	0	0.26635738420	395	321	404	194	0	0	0.266357384!sample_table_end
