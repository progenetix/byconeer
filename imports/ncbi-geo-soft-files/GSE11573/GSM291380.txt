BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	700	574	660.5	282	3	0	2	574	522.5	722	269	3	0	3	707	500	732	274	3	0	4	692.5	497	905.5	334	3		5	667.5	504	1027	322	3		6	701	490	937.5	310	3		7	5024.5	479	13477	261	0	0	-0.1630543858	4904	470	12592	265	0	0	-0.1630543859	4582	465	12086	244	0	0	-0.16305438510	466	461	250.5	220	0		11	469	458	318	224	0		12	462	453	256.5	226	0		13	484	459.5	1067	224	3	0	14	471.5	462	525	222.5	0	0	15	523	466	1103	223	0	0	16	464	457	236.5	221.5	0		17	474	470	234	226	0		18	485	478	244	230	0		19	1100	474.5	2360.5	218	3	0	20	521	478	4074	217	0	0	!sample_table_end
