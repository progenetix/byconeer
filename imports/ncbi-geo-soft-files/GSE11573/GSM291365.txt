BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	580	335	591	211	0	0	2	661.5	344	580.5	216	0	0	3	609	353	655.5	226.5	3	0	4	506	338	870	239	3		5	520	314	946	245.5	3		6	456	297	764	232	3		7	3934	278	9490	199	0	0	0.1020675018	3797.5	288	9003	199	0	0	0.1020675019	3686.5	302	8424.5	198	0	0	0.10206750110	315	299	221	191	0		11	321	303	238	189	0		12	310	295	226	191	0		13	659	295	1572	188	0	0	14	703	296	1208	184	0	0	15	716.5	297	1045	187	3	0	16	304	294	204	185	2		17	307	298	205	186.5	2		18	340	312	201	187	2		19	1065	327	299	190	3	0	20	378	340	1283	190	0	0	!sample_table_end
