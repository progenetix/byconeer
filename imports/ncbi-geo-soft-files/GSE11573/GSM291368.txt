BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	920	330	1493.5	213	0	0	0.5111653822	735	317	1327.5	203	0	0	0.5111653823	869	321	1579	210	0	0	0.5111653824	529	329	1037.5	239	3		5	514	335	996.5	244	3		6	504	325	878	237	3		7	4582.5	309	16733	210	0	0	-0.1247289638	4541	310	16217	203	0	0	-0.1247289639	4586	309.5	16198	205	0	0	-0.12472896310	369	315	309	196	0		11	371	319	300	196	0		12	370	330	297	196	0		13	1540	317	4162	194	0	0	0.15465354814	1528	334	3874	198	0	0	0.15465354815	1566	398	3788.5	209	0	0	0.15465354816	513	456	304	220	3		17	526.5	467	289	210	3		18	491	438	286	203	3		19	1659.5	452	3262	202	3	0	20	1496	483	2350	200	3	0	!sample_table_end
