BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	636	344.5	1179	275	0	0	2	641	331	1112	262	0	0	3	625	324	1415	284	0	0	4	576	331	1999.5	405.5	3		5	611	338	1757	453	3		6	610	336.5	2044	465	3		7	5060	318	23888.5	299.5	0	0	-0.0798779688	5044	309	22062	281.5	0	0	-0.0798779689	4924	308.5	22889	262	0	0	-0.07987796810	376	316	428	227.5	0		11	377	313	434	225	0		12	395	315	432.5	224	0		13	908	316	2807.5	230	0	0	14	1274	318	3310.5	235	0	0	15	835	328	2570	253	0	0	16	390.5	325	395	239	0		17	395	319	408.5	236	0		18	420	308	441.5	233	0		19	1905	308	7987	237	0	0	-0.0373260620	2153	316.5	7634	248.5	3	0	-0.03732606!sample_table_end
