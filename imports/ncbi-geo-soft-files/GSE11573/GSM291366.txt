BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	470.5	330	493.5	224	0	0	2	460	340	495	225	0	0	3	430	332	483.5	231	0	0	4	542	326	1063	265.5	3		5	476.5	305	949	257	3		6	474	303	889	245	3		7	5400	299	13607	212	0	0	-0.1213750778	4742	302	13600	210	0	0	-0.1213750779	5055.5	293	12761.5	204	0	0	-0.12137507710	334	296	267	197	0		11	329	294	247	199	0		12	323	301	260.5	204	0		13	940.5	307	1779	202	0	0	-0.07417422714	871	309	1810.5	207	0	0	-0.07417422715	733	310	1376	207	2	0	-0.07417422716	315	307	225	204	2		17	323.5	293	249	200	0		18	305	296	219	198	2		19	439	303	474	207	2	0	20	591	302	1099	201	0	0	!sample_table_end
