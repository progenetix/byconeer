BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	630.5	494	802.5	278	0	0	2	611.5	521.5	965	299	3	0	3	716.5	549.5	1199	357	3	0	4	712.5	554	1807.5	450	3		5	632	519.5	1198.5	420.5	3		6	707	472.5	1888	367.5	3		7	6949	422	23120	234	0	0	-0.2355541098	6555	387.5	23458	235	0	0	-0.2355541099	6872.5	391	24001	245	0	0	-0.23555410910	386.5	380	262	217	0		11	411	390	245	223.5	0		12	424	399	278.5	232	0		13	687.5	407	1123.5	244	0	0	-0.06175633814	419	374	388.5	232	0	0	-0.06175633815	516.5	353	709.5	204	0	0	-0.06175633816	356	349	215	199	0		17	369	350	221	200.5	0		18	359.5	354	218	198	0		19	1170	393	2985	215.5	0	0	20	409.5	431.5	298.5	216.5	0	0	!sample_table_end
