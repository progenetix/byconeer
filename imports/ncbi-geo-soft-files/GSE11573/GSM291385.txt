BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	306.5	274	529	216	0	0	2	336	260	662	214.5	0	0	3	308	266	557	219	0	0	4	416	266	1354	277	0		5	470	261	1492	288.5	0		6	406	246	1381	283	0		7	1230	231	5400	217.5	0	0	0.0899496438	1190	231.5	5040	208.5	0	0	0.0899496439	1333	242.5	5623	210	0	0	0.08994964310	262	249.5	229	195	0		11	266.5	252.5	228.5	196	0		12	253	243	226	196	0		13	343	232.5	745	192	0	0	0.08054917914	313	206	743	177	0	0	0.08054917915	213.5	202	237.5	180	0	0	0.08054917916	214.5	205.5	191	181	2		17	209	201	191.5	181	2		18	219	207	200	189	2		19	233	207	309	194	0	0	20	253.5	207	427	192.5	0	0	!sample_table_end
