BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	529	361	987	246	0	0	2	508.5	344	1235	256	0	0	3	514	347	1091	267	3	0	4	594	348	1935	368	3		5	546.5	314	1950	390.5	3		6	526	299	1953.5	408	3		7	2753	279	20593	270	0	0	-0.0270647998	2609	271	19209	238.5	0	0	-0.0270647999	2489	267	18288.5	232	0	0	-0.02706479910	307	269	338.5	199	0		11	316	271	349.5	197	0		12	307	267	344	196	0		13	533.5	259	1903	190	0	0	0.37017948914	646	260	2463	194	0	0	0.37017948915	547	283	1908.5	202	0	0	0.37017948916	310	273	311	204	0		17	288.5	268	296.5	204	0		18	301.5	261	314	202	0		19	1250	258	6212	214	0	0	20	1162	256	8074	219	0	0	!sample_table_end
