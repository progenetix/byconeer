BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	414	394.5	829	688	1	0	2	419	393	839	658.5	0	0	3	414.5	386	685	617	0	0	4	473.5	393	1146	675	1		5	473.5	410	1322	690	3		6	474	417	1254	750	0		7	692	431.5	2873	802	2	0	8	649.5	427	2662.5	792.5	2	0	9	668.5	380	3082	730.5	2	0	10	368	357	679	620	2		11	356	341	597	553	2		12	349	329.5	568	485	2		13	457	329	1628	446.5	2	0	14	475.5	313	1724	443	0	0	15	465.5	306	1613	439	2	0	16	307	289	437	382.5	2		17	310	289.5	464	402	2		18	315	293.5	516.5	445	2		19	326	300	648.5	475	1	0	20	346.5	302	868.5	507	0	0	!sample_table_end
