BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	298	262	391	234	0	0	2	272	247	475	227	0	0	3	280	254	436.5	247	0	0	4	346	271.5	901	309.5	0		5	423	275	1249.5	321	0		6	353.5	270.5	674	288.5	0		7	1458	266	5098	249	0	0	0.0254719158	1690	259	5214	250	0	0	0.0254719159	1549.5	262.5	4865.5	226.5	0	0	0.02547191510	274.5	264	233.5	206	2		11	278	271	228	205.5	2		12	269.5	246	259	211	0		13	357	225	722	205	0	0	-0.08510488314	342.5	226	711.5	219	0	0	-0.08510488315	352	225	707	216	0	0	-0.08510488316	223	221.5	224	218	2		17	229	221	215	212	2		18	228	217	207	197	2		19	252	217	273	201	0	0	20	251	216	279	198	0	0	!sample_table_end
