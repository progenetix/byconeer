BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	467	277	566	214	0	0	0.7658458392	481.5	274	577	211	0	0	0.7658458393	480	277	521	217	3	0	0.7658458394	456.5	282.5	1078.5	265.5	3		5	447	279	1126.5	279	3		6	448.5	278	1065	265	3		7	3015	272	8998	218	0	0	-0.0379532238	2540	271	8606	213.5	3	0	-0.0379532239	2791	267	8058.5	206	0	0	-0.03795322310	287	268	226	194	2		11	285	269	238	191	0		12	292.5	267	233	192	0		13	550	262	1018	190	0	0	14	509	264	938	190	0	0	15	432	271	912.5	190	0	0	16	282	267.5	202	189	2		17	275	265	215	186	3		18	271	267	198	187	2		19	310	269	1222	197	0	0	20	327	273	605.5	191	0	0	!sample_table_end
