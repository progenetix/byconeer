BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	562	240	1184.5	180	0	0	2	639	243	1150	180	0	0	3	543	251	1141.5	184	0	0	4	385	259	874	208	0		5	370	264	836	210	0		6	379	262	829	217	3		7	3678	236	14511	187	0	0	-0.1013304278	3473	232	13665	187	0	0	-0.1013304279	3398	236	13479	195	0	0	-0.10133042710	272	241	265.5	196	0		11	267	234	272	194	0		12	260	233	267	192	0		13	748	219	2160	184	0	0	0.07829947414	752	202	2179	185	0	0	0.07829947415	722	210	2074	182	0	0	0.07829947416	248	216.5	257	188	0		17	224.5	208	233.5	181	0		18	229	203	241	180	0		19	1161	203	3609	186	0	0	20	453.5	205	2303.5	179	0	0	!sample_table_end
