BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	696.5	264	434.5	385	0	0	2	602	268.5	401.5	373	0	0	3	633	278	411	364	0	0	4	1293	319	496	376	3		5	1467	351	581	443	3		6	1299	332	561.5	436	3		7	13688.5	253	5199.5	387	0	0	-0.0448368638	16368	260	5641	361	0	0	-0.0448368639	14432	240	4828	350	0	0	-0.04483686310	242	211	373	355	0		11	242	219	378	366.5	0		12	243	218	360	342.5	0		13	259.5	222.5	349	334	0	0	14	271.5	220	327.5	316.5	0	0	15	1052	220	548.5	309	0	0	16	231	222	311	305	0		17	240	220	315	302	0		18	245	223	315	309	0		19	2301	232.5	897	303	0	0	-0.03578895420	318.5	229	338	305	0	0	-0.035788954!sample_table_end
