BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	889	293	1506	249	0	0	0.145353622	840	288	1539.5	245	0	0	0.145353623	863	288	1763	248	0	0	0.145353624	531.5	291.5	1134	271	3		5	540	295	1016	287	3		6	528	291	1111	277	3		7	5378	274	16857.5	243	0	0	-0.3442099038	5389.5	274	17200	243	0	0	-0.3442099039	5606	277	18055	242.5	0	0	-0.34420990310	343	286	374	239	0		11	340.5	285	362	230	0		12	344	284	380.5	234	0		13	1907	278	5357	227	0	0	-0.25322972114	1706	274.5	4527	227	0	0	-0.25322972115	1732	273	4832	228	0	0	-0.25322972116	335	279	338.5	235.5	0		17	315.5	276	340	232	0		18	328	276	339	232	0		19	2287	276	6472.5	232	3	0	20	1381.5	274	3332	231	0	0	!sample_table_end
