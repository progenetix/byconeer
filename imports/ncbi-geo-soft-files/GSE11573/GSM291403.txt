BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	1049	241	1757	231	0	0	0.1547153122	1187	236	2011	221	0	0	0.1547153123	995	234	1603.5	226	0	0	0.1547153124	424	234	1195	263	3		5	434.5	228	1146	262	3		6	392	229	1204	261	3		7	7412.5	226.5	15359.5	225	3	0	8	7472	229	15738	218	0	0	9	7502.5	230	16265	216	0	0	10	280	233	302	202	0		11	289	236	311	208	0		12	283.5	233	308	202	0		13	2336	231	4507	203	0	0	0.11116899314	2098	231	3831	203	0	0	0.11116899315	2412.5	232	4066	200	0	0	0.11116899316	274	236	303	205	0		17	281.5	232	292	204	0		18	274	230	296.5	203	0		19	2058	226	3678	198	0	0	0.23332238220	2726	226	4974.5	207	3	0	0.233322382!sample_table_end
