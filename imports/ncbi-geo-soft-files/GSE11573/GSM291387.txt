BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	266	228	398	196	0	0	-0.7787322432	277	219	518	196	0	0	-0.7787322433	239	205	402	194	0	0	-0.7787322434	305	187	902	222	0		5	292.5	181	780.5	227	0		6	269	173	761	207	0		7	2583	169	8672	185	0	0	-0.1249957398	2504	169	8588	187	0	0	-0.1249957399	2507	172	8745	186	0	0	-0.12499573910	182	166.5	199.5	174	0		11	179	167	201	172.5	0		12	171	164	187.5	160	0		13	361	159	831	172	0	0	14	366	168	840	179	0	0	15	203	178	239	179	0	0	16	193	186	197	185	2		17	188	176	200	179	2		18	189	173	198	183	2		19	209	170	331.5	184	0	0	20	342	185	768	202	0	0	!sample_table_end
