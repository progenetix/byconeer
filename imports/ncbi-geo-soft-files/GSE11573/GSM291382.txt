BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	476	409	783	297.5	3	0	2	469	403.5	791	300	3	0	3	470	401	861	316	3	0	4	600.5	400	1934.5	384.5	3		5	592.5	378.5	1919.5	397.5	3		6	550	339	2005.5	370	3		7	3994	319	26412	304	0	0	-0.0962442328	3840	312.5	25642.5	272.5	0	0	-0.0962442329	3903.5	313.5	26405	275	0	0	-0.09624423210	328	307	302	219	0		11	331	304	281	213	0		12	318	293	270	218	0		13	518	289	1645	211	0	0	14	325.5	285	305.5	210	0	0	15	322	288	320	209	0	0	16	305	293	233	211.5	0		17	305	297	234	212	0		18	300	292	231	210	0		19	327	288	418	212	0	0	20	381	287	860	222	0	0	!sample_table_end
