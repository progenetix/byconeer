BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	1219	575	700	229	0	0	2	1204	622	719	237	0	0	3	1069	638	696	242	0	0	4	706	544	986.5	257	3		5	656	486	917.5	246	0		6	607	455	891	235	0		7	4502	465	4925.5	210	0	0	0.0792449588	4661	453	5235	203.5	0	0	0.0792449589	4711	418	5274	203	0	0	0.07924495810	442	413	249	202	2		11	445	401	256	202.5	0		12	449	396	257.5	204	0		13	1325	387	1390	201.5	0	0	-0.03538724514	1734	372	1938	205	0	0	-0.03538724515	1257	370	1355	203	0	0	-0.03538724516	417	375	238	206	2		17	409	369	242	205	0		18	394.5	369	245	206	2		19	1702	361	1421.5	203	0	0	20	879	371	1266.5	203	0	0	!sample_table_end
