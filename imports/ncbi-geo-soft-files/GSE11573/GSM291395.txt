BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	804	311	936	257	0	0	2	1335	285	1358.5	246.5	0	0	3	1669	286	1788	260	0	0	4	482	297	1221	317	3		5	504	295	1261	330	3		6	488	295	1361	347	3		7	10742	289	13622	279	0	0	-0.032669368	10413	269	13518	243	0	0	-0.032669369	10553	258	13612.5	236	0	0	-0.0326693610	309	253	326	223	0		11	314	257	343.5	231	0		12	349	285	338	243	0		13	3480	306	4388	267	0	0	0.01331956414	3199.5	294.5	3856.5	258	0	0	0.01331956415	3553.5	283.5	4254.5	244	0	0	0.01331956416	350	292	331	243	0		17	382	328	325	245	3		18	360	309	314	241.5	0		19	3705	276	3055.5	228	0	0	20	2962	252	3836	221	0	0	!sample_table_end
