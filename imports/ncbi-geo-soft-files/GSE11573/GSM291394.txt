BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	1088.5	336	2146	295	0	0	0.0795369492	1132	328	1927	263	0	0	0.0795369493	1012.5	307	1944	262	0	0	0.0795369494	431	290	1100	285	0		5	429	282	1063	298	3		6	433	273	1281	307	0		7	5271.5	275	11485	252	0	0	0.1285922218	5311	283	11468	248	0	0	0.1285922219	5067	287	10691	248	0	0	0.12859222110	351	300	351	250	0		11	354.5	314	325	244	0		12	383	333	352	248	0		13	1955	329	3746	250	0	0	0.10810593514	1774.5	314.5	3382	251	0	0	0.10810593515	1961.5	305	4379	270	0	0	0.10810593516	330	295	375	268	0		17	304	270	316.5	250	2		18	305	262	321	247	0		19	1715.5	254	3970.5	243	0	0	-0.049627220	1634	249	3827	242	0	0	-0.0496272!sample_table_end
