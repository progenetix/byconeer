BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	277	244	418	191.5	0	0	2	349	246	646	194	0	0	3	286.5	248	451	204	0	0	4	352	247	1026.5	226	0		5	345	248	955	234	0		6	367.5	251	1070	241	0		7	2186	245	8610	199	0	0	-0.5799915548	2106	245	8092	198	0	0	-0.5799915549	2112.5	245.5	8195	192	0	0	-0.57999155410	259	249	221	178	0		11	265.5	250.5	213	180	0		12	267	250	212.5	182	0		13	452	247	956.5	184	0	0	-0.36623098714	457	244.5	963	179.5	0	0	-0.36623098715	445	250	893	184	0	0	-0.36623098716	259	249	196	184	2		17	258	251.5	197.5	186	2		18	252	251	194	187	2		19	300	251	327	188.5	0	0	-0.05357995520	288	245	306	186	0	0	-0.053579955!sample_table_end
