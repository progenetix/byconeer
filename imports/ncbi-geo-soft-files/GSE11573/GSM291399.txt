BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	1223	224	1552	206	0	0	0.0883175672	1022	222	1172	203	0	0	0.0883175673	1004	232	1327.5	214	0	0	0.0883175674	419.5	245	1079.5	253	3		5	429	254	1117	269	3		6	428	256	1184	280	3		7	7625.5	251.5	7351	224	0	0	8	8389	235	11301	210	0	0	9	8259.5	220	13009	209	0	0	10	272	224	290	201	0		11	273	221	302	199	0		12	276	222	299	198	0		13	2699	217	4378	198	0	0	-0.15324298714	2644.5	218.5	4190	199	0	0	-0.15324298715	2623	232	3560	203	0	0	-0.15324298716	260.5	227	271	204	2		17	288	238	284	207	0		18	280	237.5	281.5	206	0		19	2629	235	2966	206.5	0	0	0.16945967520	2128	234	2640	207	0	0	0.169459675!sample_table_end
