BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalised by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11573!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background signal channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background signal channel 2 (Cy5)#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable)#Coriell = BAC clones misbehaving in hybridisations with Coriell cell lines were flagged (0 acceptable; 1 not acceptable)#VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio of the test (Cy3)/ reference (Cy5) sample!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Flag	Coriell	VALUE1	765.5	729	835.5	361	3	0	2	638	537.5	899	289.5	0	0	3	589.5	501	848.5	278.5	0	0	4	652	487	1647	346.5	0		5	638	480	1656	343	0		6	586.5	410.5	1670	314.5	0		7	5331	370	21688.5	243.5	0	0	-0.0080523588	4859	361	20262.5	236	0	0	-0.0080523589	5058.5	363.5	21025.5	221.5	0	0	-0.00805235810	395	374.5	263	200.5	0		11	372.5	353.5	256.5	201	0		12	363	344	243	206	0		13	479	331	799	200	0	0	0.06068820314	444.5	339	636.5	202	0	0	0.06068820315	682	406	1430	206	0	0	0.06068820316	416.5	388	229	205	0		17	358	344	227	201	0		18	365	353	226.5	204	0		19	408	358	306	202	0	0	20	427.5	362	362	200	0	0	!sample_table_end
