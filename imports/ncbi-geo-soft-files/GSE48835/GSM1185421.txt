Routinely processed 4-um thick paraffin-embedded sections from the same lesion were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined histologically.  DNA was extracted from tumor tissue using QIAampÂ® Mini kits (QIAGEN Sciences, Germantown, PA, USA), according to the manufacturerâs instructions.

Arrays were processed using manufacturer's standard settings with NimbleScan v2.5 segMNT, including spatial correction (LOESS) and qspline fit normalization, in order to compensate for differences in signal between the two dyes. CNV segments that have more than 10 probes and logR ratio â¥ Â± 0.3 were defined as CNV call. SignalMap v.1.9 was used for visual presentation of the resulting data (Roche).!Sample_platform_id = GPL16707!Sample_contact_name = Mee Joo,,Kang!Sample_contact_email = meejookang@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = Seoul National University College of Medicine!Sample_contact_address = 101 Daehak-ro, Chongno-gu!Sample_contact_city = Seoul!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 110744!Sample_contact_country = South Korea!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1185nnn/GSM1185421/suppl/GSM1185421_460135A09_2011-05-11_532.pair.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1185nnn/GSM1185421/suppl/GSM1185421_460135A09_2011-05-11_635.pair.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1185nnn/GSM1185421/suppl/GSM1185421_460135A09_2011-05-11_segMNT.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE48835!Sample_data_row_count = 134937
