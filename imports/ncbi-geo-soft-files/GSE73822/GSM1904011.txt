Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Douglas,,Levine!Sample_contact_laboratory = GYN Res Lab!Sample_contact_department = Surgery!Sample_contact_institute = MSKCC!Sample_contact_address = 1275 York Ave.!Sample_contact_city = New York!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 10065!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904011/suppl/GSM1904011_05675_10_JB_1843_GenomeWideSNP_6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904011/suppl/GSM1904011_05675_10_JB_1843_GenomeWideSNP_6.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE73822!Sample_data_row_count = 1813358#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	1.000000	1	61723	-0.719222	0.839163	nan	nanCN_473964	1.000000	1	61796	-0.455933	0.839130	nan	nanCN_473965	1.000000	1	61811	-0.777450	0.839123	nan	nanCN_473981	1.000000	1	62908	-0.744388	0.838621	nan	nanCN_473982	1.000000	1	62925	-0.613316	0.838613	nan	nanCN_497981	1.000000	1	72764	-0.101767	0.834091	nan	nanCN_502615	1.000000	1	85924	0.865799	0.828033	nan	nanCN_502613	1.000000	1	85986	-0.066399	0.828005	nan	nanCN_502614	0.000000	1	86312	-1.641772	0.827855	nan	nanCN_502616	0.000000	1	86329	-2.942860	0.827847	nan	nanCN_502843	1.000000	1	98590	-0.530888	0.822265	nan	nanCN_466171	1.000000	1	228694	-0.594973	2.096821	nan	nanCN_468414	3.000000	1	229063	0.648923	2.096903	nan	nanCN_468412	3.000000	1	229146	0.429149	2.096922	nan	nanCN_468413	3.000000	1	229161	-0.559460	2.096925	nan	nanCN_470565	3.000000	1	229607	0.075906	2.097025	nan	nanCN_468424	3.000000	1	235658	0.052458	2.098382	nan	nanCN_468425	3.000000	1	235716	0.215254	2.098395	nan	nanCN_460512	3.000000	1	356431	-0.280830	2.302943	nan	nanCN_460513	3.000000	1	356530	0.507026	2.302946	nan	nan!sample_table_end
