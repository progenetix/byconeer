Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Douglas,,Levine!Sample_contact_laboratory = GYN Res Lab!Sample_contact_department = Surgery!Sample_contact_institute = MSKCC!Sample_contact_address = 1275 York Ave.!Sample_contact_city = New York!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 10065!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904044/suppl/GSM1904044_05675_24_JB_5223_GenomeWideSNP_6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904044/suppl/GSM1904044_05675_24_JB_5223_GenomeWideSNP_6.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE73822!Sample_data_row_count = 1813358#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	61723	-0.505723	1.444067	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	61796	0.094899	1.444015	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	61811	-0.262302	1.444005	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	62908	0.241769	1.443227	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	62925	-0.366815	1.443215	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	72764	-0.204857	1.436402	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	85924	0.743254	1.427818	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	85986	0.006924	1.427779	nan	nanCN_502614	1.000000	1	86312	-1.332594	1.427575	nan	nanCN_502616	1.000000	1	86329	-1.379678	1.427565	nan	nanCN_502843	3.000000	1	98590	0.061952	1.420250	nan	nanCN_466171	3.000000	1	228694	0.740163	4.516572	nan	nanCN_468414	3.000000	1	229063	1.288306	4.516781	nan	nanCN_468412	3.000000	1	229146	0.594094	4.516828	nan	nanCN_468413	3.000000	1	229161	-0.370549	4.516837	nan	nanCN_470565	3.000000	1	229607	0.734225	4.517090	nan	nanCN_468424	3.000000	1	235658	0.787505	4.520548	nan	nanCN_468425	3.000000	1	235716	0.801499	4.520581	nan	nanCN_460512	3.000000	1	356431	0.765532	4.505399	nan	nanCN_460513	3.000000	1	356530	0.536926	4.505398	nan	nan!sample_table_end
