Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Douglas,,Levine!Sample_contact_laboratory = GYN Res Lab!Sample_contact_department = Surgery!Sample_contact_institute = MSKCC!Sample_contact_address = 1275 York Ave.!Sample_contact_city = New York!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 10065!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904012/suppl/GSM1904012_05675_12_JB_2011_GenomeWideSNP_6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904012/suppl/GSM1904012_05675_12_JB_2011_GenomeWideSNP_6.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE73822!Sample_data_row_count = 1813358#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	61723	-0.189711	2.151743	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	61796	-0.018185	2.151749	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	61811	0.062135	2.151751	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	62908	0.187262	2.151850	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	62925	-0.025699	2.151851	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	72764	0.532972	2.152610	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	85924	0.557963	2.153272	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	85986	0.147882	2.153274	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	86312	-0.276860	2.153286	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	86329	-0.450925	2.153286	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	98590	0.110877	2.153548	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	228694	0.180517	2.153569	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	229063	0.739225	2.153504	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	229146	0.273533	2.153490	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	229161	-0.495191	2.153487	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	229607	-0.268425	2.153408	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	235658	0.114898	2.152337	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	235716	-0.130679	2.152326	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	356431	0.185931	3.483194	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	356530	0.703838	3.483197	nan	nan!sample_table_end
