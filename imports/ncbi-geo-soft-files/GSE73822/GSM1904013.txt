Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Douglas,,Levine!Sample_contact_laboratory = GYN Res Lab!Sample_contact_department = Surgery!Sample_contact_institute = MSKCC!Sample_contact_address = 1275 York Ave.!Sample_contact_city = New York!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 10065!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904013/suppl/GSM1904013_05675_13_JB_2063_GenomeWideSNP_6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904013/suppl/GSM1904013_05675_13_JB_2063_GenomeWideSNP_6.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE73822!Sample_data_row_count = 1813358#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	61723	-0.094944	1.275106	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	61796	0.109579	1.274899	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	61811	0.044445	1.274856	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	62908	-0.148108	1.271754	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	62925	-0.102560	1.271706	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	72764	0.073364	1.244129	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	85924	1.206171	1.208113	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	85986	-0.485184	1.207947	nan	nanCN_502614	0.000000	1	86312	-1.691572	1.207070	nan	nanCN_502616	0.000000	1	86329	-2.734699	1.207024	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	98590	-0.411009	1.174657	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	228694	0.179959	3.361786	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	229063	0.984054	3.361762	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	229146	0.945694	3.361756	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	229161	-0.677540	3.361755	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	229607	0.719589	3.361726	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	235658	0.394291	3.361326	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	235716	0.368358	3.361322	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	356431	0.029524	3.175215	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	356530	0.711778	3.175217	nan	nan!sample_table_end
