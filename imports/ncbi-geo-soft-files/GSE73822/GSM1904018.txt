Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Douglas,,Levine!Sample_contact_laboratory = GYN Res Lab!Sample_contact_department = Surgery!Sample_contact_institute = MSKCC!Sample_contact_address = 1275 York Ave.!Sample_contact_city = New York!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 10065!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904018/suppl/GSM1904018_05675_11_JB_1989_GenomeWideSNP_6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904018/suppl/GSM1904018_05675_11_JB_1989_GenomeWideSNP_6.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE73822!Sample_data_row_count = 1813358#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	61723	-0.690615	1.520494	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	61796	-0.040756	1.520548	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	61811	-0.091572	1.520560	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	62908	-0.710365	1.521374	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	62925	-0.326138	1.521387	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	72764	0.707888	1.528782	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	85924	0.648972	1.538936	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	85986	0.114992	1.538985	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	86312	-0.976978	1.539240	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	86329	-1.269078	1.539254	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	98590	0.285580	1.549020	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	228694	0.256586	2.936752	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	229063	0.594648	2.936849	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	229146	0.325820	2.936871	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	229161	0.183501	2.936875	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	229607	-0.037383	2.936993	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	235658	0.422267	2.938599	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	235716	0.412969	2.938615	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	356431	0.968482	6.502882	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	356530	0.922506	6.502882	nan	nan!sample_table_end
