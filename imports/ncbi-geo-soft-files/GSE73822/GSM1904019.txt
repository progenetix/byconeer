Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Douglas,,Levine!Sample_contact_laboratory = GYN Res Lab!Sample_contact_department = Surgery!Sample_contact_institute = MSKCC!Sample_contact_address = 1275 York Ave.!Sample_contact_city = New York!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 10065!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904019/suppl/GSM1904019_05675_14_JB_3025_GenomeWideSNP_6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904019/suppl/GSM1904019_05675_14_JB_3025_GenomeWideSNP_6.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE73822!Sample_data_row_count = 1813358#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	61723	0.125502	1.669980	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	61796	0.006556	1.669819	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	61811	-0.071739	1.669786	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	62908	0.381335	1.667376	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	62925	0.054958	1.667338	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	72764	0.013179	1.646109	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	85924	0.409958	1.619001	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	85986	0.353081	1.618877	nan	nanCN_502614	0.000000	1	86312	-1.955116	1.618227	nan	nanCN_502616	0.000000	1	86329	-1.340071	1.618193	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	98590	0.320390	1.594573	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	228694	-0.067069	2.543138	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	229063	1.032202	2.543275	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	229146	-0.124735	2.543306	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	229161	-0.463278	2.543311	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	229607	0.285784	2.543477	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	235658	0.406777	2.545732	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	235716	0.281825	2.545754	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	356431	0.418456	3.748463	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	356530	0.589023	3.748464	nan	nan!sample_table_end
