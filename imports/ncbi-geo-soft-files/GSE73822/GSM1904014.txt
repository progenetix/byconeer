Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Douglas,,Levine!Sample_contact_laboratory = GYN Res Lab!Sample_contact_department = Surgery!Sample_contact_institute = MSKCC!Sample_contact_address = 1275 York Ave.!Sample_contact_city = New York!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 10065!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904014/suppl/GSM1904014_05675_2_JB_337_GenomeWideSNP_6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904014/suppl/GSM1904014_05675_2_JB_337_GenomeWideSNP_6.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE73822!Sample_data_row_count = 1813358#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	0.000000	1	61723	-2.016700	0.639549	nan	nanCN_473964	1.000000	1	61796	-0.414140	0.639565	nan	nanCN_473965	1.000000	1	61811	-0.672097	0.639569	nan	nanCN_473981	1.000000	1	62908	-1.229838	0.639815	nan	nanCN_473982	1.000000	1	62925	-0.634048	0.639819	nan	nanCN_497981	1.000000	1	72764	-0.159836	0.642148	nan	nanCN_502615	1.000000	1	85924	-0.058193	0.645634	nan	nanCN_502613	1.000000	1	85986	-0.549102	0.645651	nan	nanCN_502614	0.000000	1	86312	-1.485762	0.645744	nan	nanCN_502616	0.000000	1	86329	-2.674643	0.645748	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	98590	-0.075239	0.649439	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	228694	0.214135	2.367653	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	229063	0.612407	2.367811	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	229146	-0.036538	2.367846	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	229161	-0.342071	2.367853	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	229607	-0.195323	2.368044	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	235658	0.546238	2.370646	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	235716	0.152447	2.370672	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	356431	-0.001883	3.143757	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	356530	0.727218	3.143760	nan	nan!sample_table_end
