Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Douglas,,Levine!Sample_contact_laboratory = GYN Res Lab!Sample_contact_department = Surgery!Sample_contact_institute = MSKCC!Sample_contact_address = 1275 York Ave.!Sample_contact_city = New York!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 10065!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904016/suppl/GSM1904016_05675_15_GL_3793_GenomeWideSNP_6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904016/suppl/GSM1904016_05675_15_GL_3793_GenomeWideSNP_6.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE73822!Sample_data_row_count = 1813358#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	61723	-0.114917	1.893843	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	61796	0.095276	1.893844	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	61811	-0.210678	1.893844	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	62908	0.202562	1.893855	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	62925	-0.358851	1.893855	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	72764	0.152652	1.893815	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	85924	0.999743	1.893352	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	85986	0.100286	1.893349	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	86312	-0.607306	1.893331	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	86329	-0.616172	1.893330	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	98590	-0.140010	1.892446	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	228694	0.484142	2.403953	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	229063	0.593826	2.403739	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	229146	0.873360	2.403691	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	229161	-0.845840	2.403682	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	229607	0.115843	2.403423	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	235658	-0.085175	2.399895	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	235716	-0.108283	2.399862	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	356431	0.273938	2.979559	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	356530	0.365365	2.979559	nan	nan!sample_table_end
