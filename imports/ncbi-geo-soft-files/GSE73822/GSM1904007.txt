Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Douglas,,Levine!Sample_contact_laboratory = GYN Res Lab!Sample_contact_department = Surgery!Sample_contact_institute = MSKCC!Sample_contact_address = 1275 York Ave.!Sample_contact_city = New York!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 10065!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904007/suppl/GSM1904007_05675_1_JB126_GenomeWideSNP_6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904007/suppl/GSM1904007_05675_1_JB126_GenomeWideSNP_6.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE73822!Sample_data_row_count = 1813358#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	1.000000	1	61723	-0.564662	0.904977	nan	nanCN_473964	1.000000	1	61796	-0.388696	0.905005	nan	nanCN_473965	1.000000	1	61811	-0.638719	0.905011	nan	nanCN_473981	1.000000	1	62908	-1.244782	0.905433	nan	nanCN_473982	1.000000	1	62925	-0.899161	0.905440	nan	nanCN_497981	1.000000	1	72764	0.227930	0.909410	nan	nanCN_502615	1.000000	1	85924	-0.296423	0.915266	nan	nanCN_502613	1.000000	1	85986	-0.184627	0.915295	nan	nanCN_502614	1.000000	1	86312	-0.694370	0.915448	nan	nanCN_502616	0.000000	1	86329	-2.408365	0.915457	nan	nanCN_502843	3.000000	1	98590	0.194100	0.921552	nan	nanCN_466171	3.000000	1	228694	0.378819	3.508605	nan	nanCN_468414	3.000000	1	229063	0.854691	3.508528	nan	nanCN_468412	3.000000	1	229146	0.379058	3.508511	nan	nanCN_468413	3.000000	1	229161	0.256090	3.508508	nan	nanCN_470565	3.000000	1	229607	0.514634	3.508415	nan	nanCN_468424	3.000000	1	235658	0.471240	3.507154	nan	nanCN_468425	3.000000	1	235716	0.299182	3.507142	nan	nanCN_460512	3.000000	1	356431	0.355281	3.659580	nan	nanCN_460513	3.000000	1	356530	0.613712	3.659581	nan	nan!sample_table_end
