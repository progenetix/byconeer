Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Douglas,,Levine!Sample_contact_laboratory = GYN Res Lab!Sample_contact_department = Surgery!Sample_contact_institute = MSKCC!Sample_contact_address = 1275 York Ave.!Sample_contact_city = New York!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 10065!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904022/suppl/GSM1904022_05675_18_JB_4160_GenomeWideSNP_6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904022/suppl/GSM1904022_05675_18_JB_4160_GenomeWideSNP_6.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE73822!Sample_data_row_count = 1813358#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	1.000000	1	61723	-0.749302	1.038229	nan	nanCN_473964	1.000000	1	61796	-0.335989	1.038280	nan	nanCN_473965	1.000000	1	61811	-0.521015	1.038291	nan	nanCN_473981	1.000000	1	62908	-1.081527	1.039060	nan	nanCN_473982	1.000000	1	62925	-0.626823	1.039072	nan	nanCN_497981	1.000000	1	72764	0.226718	1.046216	nan	nanCN_502615	1.000000	1	85924	0.239783	1.056489	nan	nanCN_502613	1.000000	1	85986	0.237137	1.056540	nan	nanCN_502614	1.000000	1	86312	-1.373840	1.056805	nan	nanCN_502616	1.000000	1	86329	-2.023412	1.056819	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	98590	0.354595	1.067205	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	228694	0.745632	2.724701	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	229063	0.563243	2.724982	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	229146	-0.761189	2.725045	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	229161	0.019929	2.725056	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	229607	0.020936	2.725396	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	235658	0.441097	2.730030	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	235716	0.712344	2.730075	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	356431	1.074172	8.694015	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	356530	1.282530	8.694016	nan	nan!sample_table_end
