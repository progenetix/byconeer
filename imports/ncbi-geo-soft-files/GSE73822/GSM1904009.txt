Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Douglas,,Levine!Sample_contact_laboratory = GYN Res Lab!Sample_contact_department = Surgery!Sample_contact_institute = MSKCC!Sample_contact_address = 1275 York Ave.!Sample_contact_city = New York!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 10065!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904009/suppl/GSM1904009_05675_8_JB_1738_GenomeWideSNP_6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904009/suppl/GSM1904009_05675_8_JB_1738_GenomeWideSNP_6.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE73822!Sample_data_row_count = 1813358#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	2.000000	1	61723	-0.213001	1.383620	nan	nanCN_473964	2.000000	1	61796	-0.190934	1.383663	nan	nanCN_473965	2.000000	1	61811	-0.573330	1.383672	nan	nanCN_473981	2.000000	1	62908	-0.238621	1.384334	nan	nanCN_473982	2.000000	1	62925	-0.712657	1.384344	nan	nanCN_497981	2.000000	1	72764	0.227609	1.390474	nan	nanCN_502615	2.000000	1	85924	-0.827053	1.399252	nan	nanCN_502613	2.000000	1	85986	0.102483	1.399295	nan	nanCN_502614	2.000000	1	86312	-0.427424	1.399521	nan	nanCN_502616	2.000000	1	86329	-0.570431	1.399533	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	98590	0.256297	1.408366	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	228694	0.497737	3.319569	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	229063	1.266169	3.319407	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	229146	0.217293	3.319371	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	229161	0.100034	3.319364	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	229607	0.198843	3.319169	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	235658	0.388770	3.316513	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	235716	0.172775	3.316488	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	356431	-0.063576	2.448616	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	356530	0.388138	2.448617	nan	nan!sample_table_end
