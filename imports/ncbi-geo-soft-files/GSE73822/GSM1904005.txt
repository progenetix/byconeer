Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Douglas,,Levine!Sample_contact_laboratory = GYN Res Lab!Sample_contact_department = Surgery!Sample_contact_institute = MSKCC!Sample_contact_address = 1275 York Ave.!Sample_contact_city = New York!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 10065!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904005/suppl/GSM1904005_05675_5_JB_1045_GenomeWideSNP_6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1904nnn/GSM1904005/suppl/GSM1904005_05675_5_JB_1045_GenomeWideSNP_6.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE73822!Sample_data_row_count = 1813358#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = #LOH = #ALLELE DIFFERENCE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNAL	LOH	ALLELE DIFFERENCECN_473963	1.000000	1	61723	-0.363017	0.720010	nan	nanCN_473964	1.000000	1	61796	-0.838916	0.719980	nan	nanCN_473965	1.000000	1	61811	-0.814139	0.719974	nan	nanCN_473981	1.000000	1	62908	-0.715401	0.719530	nan	nanCN_473982	1.000000	1	62925	-0.753359	0.719523	nan	nanCN_497981	1.000000	1	72764	-0.526534	0.715733	nan	nanCN_502615	1.000000	1	85924	-0.037746	0.711258	nan	nanCN_502613	1.000000	1	85986	-0.882227	0.711238	nan	nanCN_502614	0.000000	1	86312	-1.917881	0.711137	nan	nanCN_502616	0.000000	1	86329	-2.127198	0.711132	nan	nanCN_502843	2.000000	1	98590	-0.036659	0.707693	nan	nanCN_466171	2.000000	1	228694	-0.463710	1.632323	nan	nanCN_468414	2.000000	1	229063	0.225315	1.632558	nan	nanCN_468412	2.000000	1	229146	-0.452122	1.632611	nan	nanCN_468413	2.000000	1	229161	0.015443	1.632620	nan	nanCN_470565	2.000000	1	229607	-1.017310	1.632905	nan	nanCN_468424	2.000000	1	235658	0.132869	1.636786	nan	nanCN_468425	2.000000	1	235716	0.427755	1.636823	nan	nanCN_460512	2.000000	1	356431	0.250971	3.281033	nan	nanCN_460513	2.000000	1	356530	0.542908	3.281034	nan	nan!sample_table_end
