Samples not treated.  Genomic DNA was prepared using the Puregene DNA Purification Tissue Kits (Gentra Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, USA).   Samples were RNase A treated for 1 hour at 37C.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3, Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA samples were digested with AluI (12.5 units) and RsaI (12.5 units) (Promega) for a minimum of 2 hours at 37C.  Digestion quality was assessed by the DNA 1000 LabChip Kit (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, Agilent Technologies).  Individual reference and experimental samples were purified using the Qiaquick PCR Cleanup Kit (Qiagen Inc., Cologne, Germany).  Labelling reactions were performed with purified digested DNA using the Bioprime labeling kit (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer's directions.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = normal male DNA (reference sample)!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Human Genomic DNA from multiple anonymous male donors!Sample_biomaterial_provider_ch2 = Promega Corporation, Madison, USA!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Purchased from Promega Corporation, Madison, USA!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3, Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Same as for CH1!Sample_hyb_protocol = Experimental and reference labelled DNA for each hybridization were pooled, mixed with 50 ug of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, USA), 52 ul of Agilent 10X Blocking Agent and 260 ul of Agilent 2X Hybridization Buffer.  Prior to hybridization to the array, the 520 ul hybridization mixtures were denatured at 100C for 1 min 30 s and incubated at 37C for 30 min.  The sample was applied to the array using an Agilent microarray hybridization chamber, and hybridized for 40h at 65C in a rotating oven (Robbins Scientific, Sunnyvale, USA) at 20 rpm.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were washed according to the manufacturer's recommendations, air dried, and scanned using an Agilent 2565AA DNA microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies, Inc).!Sample_description = osteosarcoma derived cell line vs. normal male!Sample_data_processing = Agilent CGH Data Analysis!Sample_data_processing = The data quality of each microarray was assessed using the Quality Metrics report provided by Agilent's CGH Analytics software (v.3.4) (Agilent Technologies, Inc).  This report provides acceptable ranges for quality control parameters from each microarray experiment that are based on analysis of numerous well characterized cell lines.  All CGH data (reported in VALUE column below) represent the average of dye-flip experiments for each of the samples, using the Aberration Detection Method 1 (ADM-1) based on computing significance ratios for all genomic intervals.  To make aberration calls, a robust estimate of the noise was obtained by calculating the spread of the ratio differences between consecutive probes (DLRSpread) along all chromosomes.  The ability of the DLRSpread to measure the noise of the ratios independently of the number and severity of aberrations was used to assess the overall quality of each experiment.  The ADM-1 algorithm searches for chromosomal intervals of any length, for which the mean interval ratio is significantly different from zero.  An interval has a ratio significantly different from zero if it is more than the threshold standard deviations.  For this study, the threshold was optimized to a value of 10 to reduce inherent sample noise, without negating true consistent imbalances along each chromosome.!Sample_data_processing = Raw data for individual hybridizations are linked as supplementary files at the foot of the Sample record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2879!Sample_contact_name = Shamini,,Selvarajah!Sample_contact_email = sham.selvarajah@utoronto.ca!Sample_contact_laboratory = Zielenska!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_institute = Hospital for Sick Children!Sample_contact_address = 555 University Ave!Sample_contact_city = Toronto!Sample_contact_state = Ontario!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = M5G 1X8!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM170nnn/GSM170248/suppl/GSM170248_HOS_Cy3.txt.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM170nnn/GSM170248/suppl/GSM170248_HOS_Cy5.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE7077!Sample_data_row_count = 42863
