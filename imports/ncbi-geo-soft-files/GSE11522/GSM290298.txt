Otsuki, Kawasaki Medical School, Okayama, Japan (KMS-28, KMS-34, KMS-18, KMS-11, KMS-26, KMS-27, KMM-1 and KMS-20); Dr S. Iida, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan (KM4, FR4, and AMO1), and Dr. F. Malavasi, Department of Genetics, University of Torino, Italy (LP-1); or were established in our laboratory (CMA-01, CMA-02 and CMA-03) [Verdelli D et al.; Haematologica 2005, 90: 1541-1548]. They were cultured in Iscoveâs modified Dulbeccoâs medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at concentrations ranging from 3Ã105 to 8Ã105, at 37Â°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. CMA-01, CMA-02 and CMA-03 were cultured in presence of 20U/ml recombinant human IL-6 (R&D System, Minneapolis, MN, USA).!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA extraction was performed using WizardÂ® Genomic DNA Purification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Biotinylated DNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol starting from 250 nanograms of genomic DNA.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Following fragmentation, 90 micrograms of biotin-labeled DNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 49Â°C on GeneChipÂ® Human Mapping 250K NspI Arrays. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.!Sample_scan_protocol = Human Mapping 250K NspI arrays were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix).!Sample_description = Genome-wide profiling data from Human Myeloma Cell Line KMS-26!Sample_data_processing = Genome-wide DNA profiling was performed on Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Human Mapping 250k Nsp arrays. To find the corresponding CN values, we firstly extracted the raw data from the CEL files using the Affymetrix packages GTYPE 4.1 and Copy Number Analysis Tool 4.0.1 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and the Mapping Array 250k Nsp probe annotations released on July, 12 2007. In order to keep only the raw data and thus to avoid the CN inference facility of the latter software package, the Hidden Markov Model Genomic Smoothing window was set to 0. After the preprocessing, piecewise constant estimates of the underlying local DNA CN variation was calculated using the DNA copy Bioconductor package, which looks for optimal breakpoints using circular binary segmentation (CBS).!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUE column described as "HmmMedianLog2Ratio - Genomic Bandwith Smoothing 0 Mb" is the result displayed by CNAT4.0.1 software (Affymetrix) when applying Hidden Markov Model algorithm. The Log2Ratio is the base-2 logarithm applied to the ratio between the CEL-extracted probe values in our samples and in a dataset of 48 normal samples belonging to HapMap Project and freely available on Affymetrix website http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/sample_data/500k_data.affx. The Genomic Smoothing Window was set to zero in order to extract raw data.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Luca,,Agnelli!Sample_contact_email = luca.agnelli@unimi.it, katiatodoerti@gmail.com!Sample_contact_phone = +390255033328!Sample_contact_department = Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology - Hematology 1!Sample_contact_institute = University of Milan - Fondazione IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico!Sample_contact_address = Francesco Sforza, 35!Sample_contact_city = MILAN!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20122!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM290nnn/GSM290298/suppl/GSM290298.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE11522!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = HmmMedianLog2Ratio - Genomic Bandwith Smoothing 0 Mb!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1886933	0.34SNP_A-1902458	0.34SNP_A-2131660	0.34SNP_A-4221087	0.34SNP_A-1884606	-0.17SNP_A-2235839	0.61SNP_A-2218153	0.61SNP_A-1919019	0.1SNP_A-1815933	0.1SNP_A-2115098	0.1SNP_A-2264565	0.1SNP_A-1788728	0.1SNP_A-4218776	0.28SNP_A-2082194	0.28SNP_A-2135694	0.28SNP_A-4220764	0.28SNP_A-1796345	0.28SNP_A-1789472	0.28SNP_A-1934233	0.28SNP_A-4207031	-0.32!sample_table_end
