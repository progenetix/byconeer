The Lysate was then incubated on rotator for 20 minutes with 300ul of ultra high purity phenol/chloroform and centrifuged at 13000g for 5 minutes. The aqueous and interphase layer was then transferred into a fresh tube containing 300ul of phenol/chloroform and incubated on rotator for another 20 minutes. The aqueous phase was then tranferred carefully to a fresh tube and mixed gently with 30ul 3M NaOAc pH 5.2.  The 100% ice cold Ethanol was added in the volume of 900ul and DNA pellet was left at -20C for at least 20 minutes. The pellet was then incubated on ice with 70% ice cold Ethanol and air dried. The DNA pellet was resuspended in 50ul of 10mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 500ng of test DNA and reference DNA were labeled with diluted Cy3-Random Nonamers and diluted Cy5-Random Nonamers in a 100ul reactions, respectively as in manufacture's protocol (http://www.nimblegen.com/products/lit/cgh_userguide_v6p0.pdf)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Reference DNA!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = sample type: pooled reference!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell type: B-cell!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = disease status: CLL!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Genomic DNA from six pooled male or female individuals was provided by NimbleGen and used as a common reference.!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = 500ng of test DNA and reference DNA were labeled with diluted Cy3-Random Nonamers and diluted Cy5-Random Nonamers in a 100ul reactions, respectively as in manufacture's protocol (http://www.nimblegen.com/products/lit/cgh_userguide_v6p0.pdf)!Sample_hyb_protocol = Each labeled DNA was resuspended in 5.6ul Sample Tracking Control as provided in the manufacture's kit. Master mix hybridization buffer (provided in the kit) was prepared in an according to manufacture's protocol and 20ul hybridization solution was added to each sample pair. Sample tubes were placed at 42C for 5 minutes before loading onto HX3 mixer provided in the kit. Arrays were hybridized for 40-72 h at 42C in the hybridization system. The arrays slides were washed in 42C 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, room temperature 0.2x SSC, and 0.05x SSC as in manufacture's protocol.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned on at 532nm (for Cy3) and 635nm (for Cy5) using a MS 200 Microarray Scanner!Sample_data_processing = Arrays were processed using NimbleScan 2.5 software according to standard protocols. Normalization compensates for inherent differences in signal between Cy3 and Cy5 dyes. After combining the signal intensity information with the genomic coordinate information, and applying spatial correction (for 2.1M, 3x720K, and 12x135K arrays arrays), the Cy3 and Cy5 signal intensities are normalized to one another using qspline normalization (Workman C, et al., 2002).!Sample_platform_id = GPL10461!Sample_contact_name = Duncan,,Baird!Sample_contact_email = bairddm@cardiff.ac.uk!Sample_contact_department = School of Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = Cardiff University!Sample_contact_address = Heath Park!Sample_contact_city = Cardiff!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CF14 4XN!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM547nnn/GSM547261/suppl/GSM547261_34641402_532.pair.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM547nnn/GSM547261/suppl/GSM547261_34641402_635.pair.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM547nnn/GSM547261/suppl/GSM547261_34641402_segMNT.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE22016!Sample_data_row_count = 714000#ID_REF = #VALUE = qspline normalized log2 ratio Cy3/Cy5 (test/ref)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUECHR01FS000017796	-0.046CHR01FS000018498	0.280CHR01FS000032527	0.017CHR01FS000036566	0.383CHR01FS000037530	0.198CHR01FS000041351	0.535CHR01FS000047954	0.636CHR01FS000049120	0.400CHR01FS000055933	-0.323CHR01FS000059584	0.385CHR01FS000060439	-0.130CHR01FS000067799	-0.174CHR01FS000077671	-0.332CHR01FS000079192	0.278CHR01FS000096393	-0.531CHR01FS000226030	-0.400CHR01FS000241438	0.032CHR01FS000242507	0.021CHR01FS000346444	0.066CHR01FS000349011	-0.126!sample_table_end
