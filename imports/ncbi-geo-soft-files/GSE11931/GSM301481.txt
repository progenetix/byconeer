Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	18782	310	29637	145	-0.467863	0	-0.4187932	19450.5	314.5	30205	163	-0.451025	0	-0.4187933	18994.5	314.5	30245	145	-0.477072	0	-0.4187934	12718.5	354	21283	173.5	-0.534894	0	-0.432815	12843	312	21567.5	171	-0.535022	0	-0.432816	12919.5	373	20994	198	-0.505319	0	-0.432817	19534	388	31726	191	-0.499004	0	-0.435958	19212	344.5	31363.5	239	-0.500554	0	-0.435959	19435.5	394	32044	246	-0.512783	0	-0.4359510	13993.5	347	22298	206	-0.481732	0	-0.4328111	14087	317	22564.5	214	-0.484356	0	-0.4328112	13483.5	307	22580.5	192	-0.530112	0	-0.4328113	23041	446	37749	255	-0.506452	0	-0.41783514	23660.5	331	37019	186	-0.456676	0	-0.41783515	23639.5	369	37889	207	-0.481996	0	-0.41783516	23601	329.5	37270	244.5	-0.464377	0	-0.4359517	24256.5	373	38254	228	-0.465082	0	-0.4359518	24891	434.5	38208	213	-0.440559	0	-0.4359519	21482	294	34240.5	152	-0.475525	0	-0.41783520	20730	283	34169	148	-0.509142	0	-0.417835!sample_table_end
