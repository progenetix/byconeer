Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	14997	462.5	20200	381	-0.310116	0	-0.2402272	15948	450	21024	360	-0.287682	0	-0.2402273	16369	430	22347	379	-0.320818	0	-0.2402274	13465	448	17919	373	-0.29857	0	-0.2383465	13651	401.5	18081	390	-0.289096	0	-0.2383466	13686	427	18360	354	-0.306028	0	-0.2383467	17661	357	23217	352	-0.27867	0	-0.2440928	17581	410	23003.5	316.5	-0.27857	0	-0.2440929	18965.5	396.5	23951	327	-0.24077	0	-0.24409210	13586	339	17218	301	-0.244548	0	-0.23834611	13530	303.5	17876	282	-0.285336	0	-0.23834612	13682.5	287	18136	291.5	-0.286777	0	-0.23834613	24445	381	31603	335	-0.261878	0	-0.21920214	25239	376	31588	322	-0.22915	0	-0.21920215	25331.5	384.5	31720	339	-0.229449	0	-0.21920216	26126	352	33219	345	-0.243316	0	-0.24409217	25610.5	352	33966.5	350	-0.285854	0	-0.24409218	24946	281	34241	347	-0.317853	0	-0.24409219	26499	476	31828	430	-0.187763	0	-0.21920220	25114.5	410	31665	425.5	-0.234698	0	-0.219202!sample_table_end
