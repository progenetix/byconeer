Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	22916	221.5	20590.5	0	0.097293	0	0.1354992	21897.5	229	20153	0	0.072506	0	0.1354993	21940.5	214.5	19593	10	0.103848	0	0.1354994	12503	251	14532	7.5	-0.170148	0	-0.0627955	12346	210	14580	14	-0.182514	0	-0.0627956	12056	228.5	14208.5	25	-0.181652	0	-0.0627957	17098	244	21472.5	15.5	-0.241463	0	-0.0710288	17188	254	20471.5	18.5	-0.188806	0	-0.0710289	16929	277.5	20357	23	-0.199794	0	-0.07102810	11879	294	13062	7	-0.11946	0	-0.06279511	12248	229	13596.5	0	-0.123324	0	-0.06279512	12288	254	13125	7	-0.086249	0	-0.06279513	19918	286	21318	3	-0.08225	0	-0.07188214	19860.5	257.5	21319	32	-0.082414	0	-0.07188215	18849.5	285.5	20981	9	-0.121964	0	-0.07188216	28109	278	20955.5	22	0.2848	0	0.26738917	29247	333	20494	24	0.345366	0	0.26738918	29410	349.5	20693.5	15	0.340285	0	0.26738919	28437	241	32411	12	-0.138947	0	-0.07188220	27215	246	31465	9	-0.153902	0	-0.071882!sample_table_end
