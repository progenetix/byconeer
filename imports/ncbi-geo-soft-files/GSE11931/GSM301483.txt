Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	15099	231	17639	72	-0.166811	0	-0.1600632	15386.5	273	18199.5	57	-0.182669	0	-0.1600633	14666	275	17879	78	-0.212652	0	-0.1600634	8945	297.5	13029	94	-0.402667	0	-0.2477025	8997.5	313.5	13160	81	-0.409526	0	-0.2477026	8972	293	12976	87	-0.395468	0	-0.2477027	13727.5	303.5	18163	93	-0.297209	0	-0.2284228	14358	315	18654	112.5	-0.277887	0	-0.2284229	14172	286	18549	94	-0.284454	0	-0.22842210	9706	213	13282	31	-0.333518	0	-0.24770211	9993.5	206	13343.5	73	-0.304437	0	-0.24770212	9909	249	13491	78.5	-0.328193	0	-0.24770213	16971	261.5	21395	97	-0.242636	0	-0.22486414	17633.5	270.5	21683.5	81.5	-0.218444	0	-0.22486415	17331.5	279	22126	85	-0.256608	0	-0.22486416	17941.5	262	22469	84	-0.235985	0	-0.22842217	17853.5	211.5	22485	78	-0.239091	0	-0.22842218	17789	306	22541	83	-0.250418	0	-0.22842219	16542.5	214	20952.5	46	-0.247148	0	-0.22486420	16431.5	244	20788	44.5	-0.247994	0	-0.224864!sample_table_end
