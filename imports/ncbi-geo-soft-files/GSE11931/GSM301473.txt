Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	9123.5	270.5	14323	214	-0.466057	0	-0.3308942	7976	298	11667	200	-0.401114	0	-0.3308943	7848.5	361	12509	203	-0.496852	0	-0.3308944	6195.5	329.5	10694	239	-0.577907	0	-0.3945835	6171	340	10925.5	275	-0.602418	0	-0.3945836	6283	359	11147	255	-0.609017	0	-0.3945837	9662.5	345	14396	211	-0.420291	0	-0.2470978	9676.5	277	14177.5	221	-0.395289	0	-0.2470979	10288.5	301	14746.5	212	-0.375191	0	-0.24709710	6671	280.5	10915	200	-0.516832	0	-0.39458311	6929	304	11152	198	-0.502854	0	-0.39458312	6670	326	10792	195	-0.513061	0	-0.39458313	12118	336	19110	214	-0.472377	0	-0.37620914	12152.5	271	18092.5	201	-0.409343	0	-0.37620915	12232	335	18080	208.5	-0.406921	0	-0.37620916	13224.5	252	18028	176	-0.319284	0	-0.29686217	13318	314	18332	207	-0.332035	0	-0.29686218	12898	303	17705.5	211	-0.328587	0	-0.29686219	13918.5	329	19615	211	-0.356182	0	-0.37620920	11649	326	17780.5	207.5	-0.439528	0	-0.376209!sample_table_end
