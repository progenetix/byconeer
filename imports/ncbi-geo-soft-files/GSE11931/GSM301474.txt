Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	17409	276	24899	333	-0.360357	0	-0.3303322	16778	315	25216.5	349	-0.412446	0	-0.3303323	17530	383	24725	358	-0.351407	0	-0.3303324	10466.5	359.5	17140.5	400	-0.504603	0	-0.4400585	11194	338	17475.5	370	-0.454682	0	-0.4400586	10847.5	397.5	16301	401	-0.419717	0	-0.4400587	15013.5	398.5	23789.5	413.5	-0.469661	0	-0.4192918	15430	424	24314	435	-0.464549	0	-0.4192919	15183	417	23941	494	-0.462415	0	-0.41929110	10248	456	16326	513	-0.479267	0	-0.44005811	10879	441	16354.5	450.5	-0.421118	0	-0.44005812	10302.5	463	16924	484.5	-0.513282	0	-0.44005813	19230.5	411	26220	451	-0.314279	0	-0.39258614	19881.5	491	26757	463	-0.304558	0	-0.39258615	19674	409	25274	453	-0.2534	0	-0.39258616	18111	411.5	26933	397.5	-0.404947	0	-0.41929117	18739	372	27948.5	383	-0.406009	0	-0.41929118	18205	461.5	27428	395	-0.421039	0	-0.41929119	17953	317	28978	314	-0.4857	0	-0.39258620	18265.5	341	28037.5	296	-0.436761	0	-0.392586!sample_table_end
