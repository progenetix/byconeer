Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	22210	425	26233	122	-0.181135	0	-0.138112	21690	334	26149.5	92	-0.198973	0	-0.138113	21041	363	24988.5	125	-0.184331	0	-0.138114	12384	391	19714	153	-0.489215	0	-0.3125345	12273	335	19700	120	-0.494782	0	-0.3125346	12082	350	19066	126.5	-0.47893	0	-0.3125347	18018	392	28096	140	-0.461257	0	-0.3035368	17874	389	28133.5	147.5	-0.470361	0	-0.3035369	18050	443	27575.5	150	-0.443177	0	-0.30353610	11698	345	18040	139	-0.455375	0	-0.31253411	11715	396	18386.5	151	-0.476888	0	-0.31253412	11684.5	360	18401	131	-0.478292	0	-0.31253413	24842	418	29277	153.5	-0.175979	0	-0.15645514	24267.5	359.5	28353	115	-0.166455	0	-0.15645515	23564	382	28259	136	-0.193212	0	-0.15645516	29566	477.5	30016.5	143.5	-0.026612	0	-0.01773517	29228	412	30291	142.5	-0.045204	0	-0.01773518	30113	435	29887	150	-0.001986	0	-0.01773519	33477.5	305.5	40915	146	-0.206216	0	-0.15645520	31682.5	334	40060	132.5	-0.241899	0	-0.156455!sample_table_end
