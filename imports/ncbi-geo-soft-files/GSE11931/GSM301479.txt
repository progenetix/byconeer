Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	15744	196	16965	194	-0.075719	0	-0.0065612	16016	252	17295	255	-0.077835	0	-0.0065613	15801	186	16996	251	-0.069868	0	-0.0065614	11732	202.5	11752	250	0.002388	0	-0.0020435	11483	349	11913	313	-0.041002	0	-0.0020436	11380	369	11300	356.5	0.006149	3	7	15121.5	151	15075	170.5	0.004418	0	0.0226218	15350	161	15135	169	0.014791	0	0.0226219	14775	134.5	15657	155	-0.057177	0	0.02262110	11020.5	140	11041	190	0.002715	0	-0.00204311	10889	144	11435	156	-0.048502	0	-0.00204312	10720	181	11566.5	176	-0.077697	0	-0.00204313	17176	167	17652	191	-0.026227	0	0.0182714	17501.5	153.5	18547.5	177	-0.057269	0	0.0182715	17202	172	17759.5	172.5	-0.032183	0	0.0182716	19508	197	19551	189	-0.002638	0	0.02262117	18769	187	19984	203	-0.062529	0	0.02262118	19451	221	19689.5	221	-0.012326	0	0.02262119	18488	185	19332	214	-0.043565	0	0.0182720	18744	224	20147	288	-0.069806	0	0.01827!sample_table_end
