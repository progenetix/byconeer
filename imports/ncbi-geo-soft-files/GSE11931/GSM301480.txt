Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	21234.5	262	21814	150	-0.03244	0	0.024342	20446	233	21601	174	-0.058326	0	0.024343	21587.5	281	20580	178.5	0.043404	0	0.024344	12957	300	15052.5	166	-0.162244	0	-0.107465	13308	274	15686	178	-0.173795	0	-0.107466	13356.5	305.5	15320	192	-0.147683	0	-0.107467	15159	336	20420	174	-0.311777	0	-0.2169448	16483	301	19610	167	-0.183588	0	-0.2169449	15694.5	280.5	21521	186	-0.325073	0	-0.21694410	11488	343.5	15401	180	-0.31173	0	-0.21167211	11538	311	15249.5	169.5	-0.295048	0	-0.21167212	11693	297	15318.5	167.5	-0.284804	0	-0.21167213	21482	314	23715	185	-0.105786	0	-0.08062114	22852	307.5	24616	185	-0.080362	0	-0.08062115	21718	338.5	23582.5	191	-0.08994	0	-0.08062116	26162	358	24746	192	0.049655	0	0.04898917	26575	277	25425.5	184.5	0.041023	0	0.04898918	26076.5	297.5	24341.5	173.5	0.064531	0	0.04898919	23728.5	280	26872	169	-0.129969	0	-0.08062120	23088	277	27283	167	-0.172881	0	-0.080621!sample_table_end
