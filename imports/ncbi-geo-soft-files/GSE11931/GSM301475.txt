Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	15569	127	20721	0	-0.294057	0	-0.3039522	14853.5	105	22165.5	39	-0.405635	0	-0.3039523	14907	140	21998	42	-0.396645	0	-0.3039524	7472	87	15407	15	-0.734397	0	-0.4814245	7606	136	14617.5	14	-0.670366	0	-0.4814246	7258	108	14622	47.5	-0.712161	0	-0.4814247	13846	146	21418	14	-0.446182	0	-0.3060828	14247	105	21508	31	-0.417834	0	-0.3060829	14331.5	102	21950.5	27	-0.432242	0	-0.30608210	10289.5	147	15429	7	-0.419061	0	-0.32492311	10418	128	15554	20	-0.411859	0	-0.32492312	10376.5	136.5	15806	8	-0.433582	0	-0.32492313	18191	156	24531	27	-0.306522	0	-0.12266514	18511	165	24720.5	32	-0.296926	0	-0.12266515	17561	169	24101.5	57	-0.323896	0	-0.12266516	20128	163	24925	58	-0.219561	0	-0.17927717	21637	176	24893.5	82.5	-0.14505	0	-0.17927718	21552	165	24258.5	87.5	-0.12237	0	-0.17927719	20734	111	22327	38.5	-0.077664	0	-0.12266520	20923	104	22377	17	-0.071408	0	-0.122665!sample_table_end
