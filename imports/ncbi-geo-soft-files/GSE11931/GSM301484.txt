Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	17064	380.5	19200	47.5	-0.138013	0	-0.0284552	17072	440	19322	43	-0.147688	0	-0.0284553	17880.5	457	19210	57	-0.094639	0	-0.0284554	14712	345	15158.5	47	-0.050522	0	0.0627735	15013	445	15705	45.5	-0.07225	0	0.0627736	14783	400	14728	46	-0.020575	0	0.0627737	19896	395	20186	50	-0.032044	0	0.2204338	19646	452	20660	85	-0.069479	0	0.2204339	19924	418	20250	70.5	-0.033945	0	0.22043310	15154	387	14285.5	88	0.039329	0	0.06277311	15425	417	14169	68.5	0.062373	0	0.06277312	15808	389	14315	52	0.077932	0	0.06277313	21947	440.5	21188	100.5	0.019675	0	0.07823214	21534	462	20614.5	47	0.024233	0	0.07823215	20652	483.5	20702	82	-0.022139	0	0.07823216	29979	513	22151	83.5	0.289131	0	0.22043317	29096	478	22097	107	0.263448	0	0.22043318	29210	475	22808	126	0.236544	0	0.22043319	24322	446	23563	62	0.015831	0	0.07823220	23811	408.5	22485.5	49	0.042154	0	0.078232!sample_table_end
