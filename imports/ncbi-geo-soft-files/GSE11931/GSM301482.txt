Oncogene 2006, 25(17):2558-64!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in ImaGene 5.6.1 software using default settings. BAC clones were positioned along the genome according to the May 2004 freeze. After exclusion of flagged spots, the average of the triplicate spots was calculated for each BAC clone and 2log ratios (tumour/normal reference signal) were normalized by subtraction of the mode value of BAC clones on chromosome 1-22. BAC clones with flagged spots were excluded from analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3441!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11931!Sample_series_id = GSE12020!Sample_data_row_count = 15552#ID_REF = #Signal Median CH1 = Spot Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Background Median CH1 = Background Signal in Channel 1 (Cy3)#Signal Median CH2 = Spot Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Background Median CH2 = Background Signal in Channel 2 (Cy5)#Log2ratio = Log2ratio Cy3, Cy5#Flag = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artafacts (0 acceptable; 1-4 not acceptable#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio, flagged features are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal Median CH1	Background Median CH1	Signal Median CH2	Background Median CH2	Log2ratio	Flag	VALUE1	14462	329	19037.5	207.5	-0.286939	0	-0.1625872	15073	295	19096.5	173.5	-0.247239	0	-0.1625873	15663	257	19243	127	-0.215769	0	-0.1625874	11094.5	318	14519	183	-0.285406	0	-0.1985185	11372.5	349	14040	163	-0.230203	0	-0.1985186	11540	311	15117	158	-0.286813	0	-0.1985187	16347	332	21018	163	-0.264068	0	-0.0960398	16435	295	21446	219	-0.273973	0	-0.0960399	17056	346	22038	228.5	-0.266338	0	-0.09603910	13072	335	15589	264	-0.184974	0	-0.19851811	12195.5	360	15639	223	-0.264302	0	-0.19851812	12389	369	14958.5	264	-0.200901	0	-0.19851813	18988	414	23591.5	263	-0.227913	3	14	18777.5	372.5	23549	269	-0.234972	0	-0.1925915	18107	399	22476	326	-0.223821	0	-0.1925916	24790	434	23965.5	305.5	0.028992	0	0.02287517	25637	422	24381	282	0.045269	0	0.02287518	25179.5	486	24196.5	294	0.032557	0	0.02287519	16617	337.5	22813	191	-0.329016	0	-0.1925920	16123	290	22765.5	182.5	-0.355101	0	-0.19259!sample_table_end
