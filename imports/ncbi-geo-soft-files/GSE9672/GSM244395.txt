Grid placement, spot quality, data normalisation and fluorescence quantification of the array image were performed using the UCSF "SPOT" software. The software automatically calculates a log2 ratio using duplicate spots from the identical clones on each array. Duplicate hybridisations were performed in 22 out of 29 samples to verify the reproducibility of the data (the average correlation coefficient was 0.93Â±0.18) and the median of a normalised log2 ratio in each clone was used for the further analysis.!Sample_data_processing = The genomic positions of BAC/PAC clones on the array were mapped according to the Ensembl genome browser (Ver39, June 2006) (http://www.ensembl.org/index.html). Chromosome Y was not analysed and the data from 22 clones were excluded from the analysis due to either printing problems of the spots or unambiguous genomic positions. Finally, the log2-transformed data from a total of 3,036 clones were used as a final dataset of each case.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6181!Sample_contact_name = Tomohiko,,Harada!Sample_contact_email = tomo-harada@umin.ac.jp!Sample_contact_laboratory = Barts and The London!Sample_contact_department = Centre for Molecular Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Cancer Research UK!Sample_contact_address = Charterhouse Square!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = EC1M 6BQ!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM244nnn/GSM244395/suppl/GSM244395.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE9672!Sample_data_row_count = 3157#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalised log2 (Cy5/Cy3) ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	0.08653822	0.1116195813	-0.1661963374	-0.1133670575	-0.0847502886	0.0231865217	-0.111274398	-0.0399157599	-0.04075408719	-0.08552513720	-0.03980291921	-0.05214320922	0.0795375424	-0.11460866425	0.02931695626	-0.03410838527	-0.14212000137	-0.02969991938	-0.10722407139	-0.010498931!sample_table_end
