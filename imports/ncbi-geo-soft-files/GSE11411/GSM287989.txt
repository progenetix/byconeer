DNA precipitate was washed with 70% ethanol then eluted in DNAse free water. !Sample_label_ch1 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Labelling reactions were performed using the Agilent Genomic DNA Labeling Kit PLUS (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, USA) according to the manufacturerâs directions. Briefly, DNA was labelled with 1.5 - 3 mM Cy5-dUTP (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, USA), and purified using a Centricon YM-30 filter (Millipore, Billerica, USA).  !Sample_source_name_ch2 = Normal Human Genomic DNA!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Human Genomic DNA from multiple anonymous male donors (Promega Corporation, Madison, USA)!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Comercial DNA extracted as per manifacturers instructions - Human Genomic DNA from multiple anonymous male donors (Promega Corporation, Madison, USA)!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Labelling reactions were performed using the Agilent Genomic DNA Labeling Kit PLUS (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, USA) according to the manufacturerâs directions. Briefly, DNA was labelled with 1.5 - 3 mM Cy3-dUTP (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, USA), and purified using a Centricon YM-30 filter (Millipore, Billerica, USA).  !Sample_hyb_protocol = Probe mixture of Cy3-labelled sample DNA, Cy5-labelled reference DNA, 50 Î¼l of 1.0mg/ ml of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, USA), 52 Î¼l of Agilent 10X Blocking Agent and 260 Î¼l of Agilent 2X Hybridization Buffer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) was denatured at 100C for 1 minute 30 seconds and incubated at 37C for 30 minutes.  The probe was applied to the array using an Agilent microarray hybridization chamber, and hybridized for 40 hours at 65C in a rotating oven (Robbins Scientific, Sunnyvale, USA) at 20 rpm. Arrays were washed according to the manufacturerâs recommendation and air dried.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned using an Agilent 2565AA DNA microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies, Inc).!Sample_description = The Agilent Human Genome CGH microarray 244A (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, USA) were used for the U2OS array-CGH experiments.  Three Î¼g of Human Genomic DNA from multiple anonymous male donors (Promega Corporation, Madison, USA) and 3 Î¼g of test genomic DNA sample were digested with AluI (5 units) and RsaI (5 units) (Promega) for a minimum of 2 hours at 37C.  Digestion quality was assessed by the DNA 1000 LabChip Kit (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, Agilent Technologies).  Labelling reactions were performed using the Agilent Genomic DNA Labeling Kit PLUS (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, USA) according to the manufacturerâs directions. Briefly, the reference and sample DNA were labelled with 1.5 - 3 mM Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, USA), and purified using a Centricon YM-30 filter (Millipore, Billerica, USA).  Probe mixture of Cy3-labelled sample DNA, Cy5-labelled reference DNA, 50 Î¼l of 1.0mg/ ml of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, USA), 52 Î¼l of Agilent 10X Blocking Agent and 260 Î¼l of Agilent 2X Hybridization Buffer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) was denatured at 100C for 1 minute 30 seconds and incubated at 37C for 30 minutes.  The probe was applied to the array using an Agilent microarray hybridization chamber, and hybridized for 40 hours at 65C in a rotating oven (Robbins Scientific, Sunnyvale, USA) at 20 rpm. Arrays were washed according to the manufacturerâs recommendations; air dried, and scanned using an Agilent 2565AA DNA microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies, Inc), and processed using Agilentâs Feature Extraction software.
