The samples were then subjected to phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation.!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 200ng of genomic DNA was whole-genome amplified in an overnight reaction at 37ÂºC using amplification master mix (WG-MSM) and primer/neutralization mix (WG-MA2). After incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FMS) and precipitated with 2-propanol and precipitation mix (PM1). The precipitated DNA was resuspended using RA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed (XC1, XC2, TEM, STM, ATM, XC3, PB1) on a Teflow chamber rack system.!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining, BeadChip arrays were coated with PB1/XC4/ethanol, dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from lung tumors was genotyped using Infinium HumanOmni1-Quad Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_description = 143T!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 3.1.3 with GT module 3.2.33 (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8882!Sample_contact_name = Sandra,,Castillo!Sample_contact_institute = IDIBELL-PEBC!Sample_contact_address = Avda.
