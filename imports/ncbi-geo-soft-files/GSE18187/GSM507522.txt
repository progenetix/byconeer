The sections were then deparaffinized with Xylene, processed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and stained with haematoxylin. Lasercapture microdissection was performed at multiple sites using Veritas Arcturus. Cells were digested in 10 Âµl TE, pH 9, and 0.5 Âµl proteinase K (20 mg/ml) for 48h at 55Â°C. After inactivation of proteinase K at 99Â°C for 10 min, the digest was stored at -20Â°C. Without any further purification, the complete digest was used for whole genome amplification by means of the WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) kit from Sigma.!Sample_label_ch1 = Alexa Fluor 3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming according Invitrogens recommendation (Invitrogen BioPrime Total Genomic Labeling System).Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DNA pool isolated from laser captured microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy tissue.!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: mammary tissue without histomorphological changes obtained from reduction mammoplasty specimens!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Whole genome amplification by GenomePlex (Sigma).!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens cut at 7-8Âµm were mounted on special foil-coated slides (Molecular Devices, San Diego, USA).

Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgrid LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.15 and -0.15, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM507nnn/GSM507522/suppl/GSM507522_MC_6623_6624_r_Cy3_5DIN83119_99_Cy5_fpool_S68_120207.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18187!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio Cy5/Cy3#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	0.171	466	156	267	54	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	272	156	120	55	01_1_3_397B22	0.104	1484	155	942	55	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	153	155	55	54	-501_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	2153	152	909	53	01_1_6_F0488J12	-0.088	1871	155	1056	54	01_1_7_N0413M21	-0.042	696	169	372	59	01_1_8_D2542F24	0.063	1710	162	1068	56	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.095	1186	163	742	58	01_1_10_N0673B19	null	156	160	54	57	-501_1_11_N0090E12(del)	null	166	160	59	56	-501_1_12_N0097G03	null	154	160	56	54	-501_1_13_N1030C19	-0.107	2028	157	1137	53	01_1_14_N0345M21	null	158	157	53	54	-501_1_15_N0281A03	0.094	174	158	66	54	01_1_16_N0771D21	null	156	168	54	62	-501_1_17_N0504D21	-0.119	586	200	284	78	01_1_18_N0490A23	-0.32	3521	160	1724	55	01_1_19_M2112G04	-0.017	1261	160	730	55	01_1_20_N0282F14	null	158	162	55	57	-50!sample_table_end
