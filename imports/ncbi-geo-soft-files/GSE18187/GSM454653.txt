The sections were then deparaffinized with Xylene, processed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and stained with haematoxylin. Lasercapture microdissection for both lesions was performed at multiple sites using Veritas Arcturus. Cells were digested in 10Âµl TE, pH 9, and 0.5Âµl proteinase K (20mg/ml) for 48h at 55Â°C. After inactivation of proteinase K at 99Â°C for 10min, the digest was stored at -20Â°C.  Without any further purification, the complete digest was used for whole genome amplification by means of the WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) kit from Sigma.!Sample_label_ch1 = Alexa Fluor 3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming according Invitrogens recommendation (Invitrogen BioPrimeÂ® Total Genomic Labeling System).Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DNA pool isolated from laser captured microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy tissue.!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: mammary tissue without histomorphological changes obtained from reduction mammoplasty specimens!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Whole genome amplification by GenomePlex (Sigma).!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens cut at 7-8Âµm were mounted on special foil-coated slides (Molecular Devices, San Diego, USA).

PMT settings: 100/100!Sample_description = Array CGH analysis of a female patient with classic lobular intraepithelial neoplasia (LIN).!Sample_data_processing = TIFF images were analysed by Genepix 5.0 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and raw intensities (gpr files) were imported into CGHPRO (Chen at al.,2005).Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.15 and -0.15, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454653/suppl/GSM454653_MC_7117_7118_r_Cy3_15LIN_83119_99_Cy5_fpool_S84_140507.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18187!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio Cy5/Cy3#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	null	288	202	179	115	-1001_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	207	210	132	124	-1001_1_3_397B22	null	451	218	319	132	-1001_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	273	215	195	128	-1001_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	295	212	185	134	-1001_1_6_F0488J12	null	771	208	458	124	-1001_1_7_N0413M21	null	439	194	185	125	-1001_1_8_D2542F24	null	446	261	372	303	-1001_1_9_N0137H06	null	307	214	218	140	-1001_1_10_N0673B19	null	260	213	197	140	-1001_1_11_N0090E12(del)	null	345	207	173	135	-1001_1_12_N0097G03	null	580	210	375	135	-1001_1_13_N1030C19	null	271	202	181	138	-1001_1_14_N0345M21	null	2006	210	1583	145	-1001_1_15_N0281A03	null	408	214	278	155	-1001_1_16_N0771D21	null	292	208	229	159	-1001_1_17_N0504D21	null	265	220	202	168	-1001_1_18_N0490A23	null	697	222	385	168	-1001_1_19_M2112G04	null	283	219	215	175	-1001_1_20_N0282F14	null	355	238	242	191	-100!sample_table_end
