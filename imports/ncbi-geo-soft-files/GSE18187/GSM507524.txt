The sections were then deparaffinized with Xylene, processed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and stained with haematoxylin. Lasercapture microdissection was performed at multiple sites using Veritas Arcturus. Cells were digested in 10 Âµl TE, pH 9, and 0.5 Âµl proteinase K (20 mg/ml) for 48h at 55Â°C. After inactivation of proteinase K at 99Â°C for 10 min, the digest was stored at -20Â°C. Without any further purification, the complete digest was used for whole genome amplification by means of the WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) kit from Sigma.!Sample_label_ch1 = Alexa Fluor 3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming according Invitrogens recommendation (Invitrogen BioPrime Total Genomic Labeling System).Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DNA pool isolated from laser captured microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy tissue.!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: mammary tissue without histomorphological changes obtained from reduction mammoplasty specimens!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Whole genome amplification by GenomePlex (Sigma).!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens cut at 7-8Âµm were mounted on special foil-coated slides (Molecular Devices, San Diego, USA).

Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgrid LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.15 and -0.15, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM507nnn/GSM507524/suppl/GSM507524_MC_6655_6656_r_Cy3_12DIN69092_03_Cy5_fpool_S21_190906b.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18187!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio Cy5/Cy3#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	-0.045	681	167	299	58	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	261	172	120	60	01_1_3_397B22	0.088	661	175	318	61	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	341	176	135	62	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	598	179	191	63	01_1_6_F0488J12	-0.011	660	180	297	62	01_1_7_N0413M21	0.189	307	178	149	59	01_1_8_D2542F24	0.118	340	176	159	60	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.097	352	171	163	59	01_1_10_N0673B19	null	170	172	59	60	-501_1_11_N0090E12(del)	0.085	506	172	241	59	01_1_12_N0097G03	-0.254	243	178	76	60	01_1_13_N1030C19	-0.073	507	183	216	64	01_1_14_N0345M21	-0.072	195	179	65	58	01_1_15_N0281A03	0.073	498	185	235	63	01_1_16_N0771D21	-0.035	2448	181	1096	60	01_1_17_N0504D21	0.074	458	187	215	62	01_1_18_N0490A23	-0.131	403	195	161	67	01_1_19_M2112G04	0.067	368	188	168	61	01_1_20_N0282F14	-0.038	257	197	98	63	0!sample_table_end
