The sections were then deparaffinized with Xylene, processed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and stained with haematoxylin. Lasercapture microdissection for both lesions was performed at multiple sites using Veritas Arcturus. Cells were digested in 10Âµl TE, pH 9, and 0.5Âµl proteinase K (20mg/ml) for 48h at 55Â°C. After inactivation of proteinase K at 99Â°C for 10min, the digest was stored at -20Â°C.  Without any further purification, the complete digest was used for whole genome amplification by means of the WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) kit from Sigma.!Sample_label_ch1 = Alexa Fluor 3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming according Invitrogens recommendation (Invitrogen BioPrimeÂ® Total Genomic Labeling System).Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DNA pool isolated from laser captured microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy tissue.!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: mammary tissue without histomorphological changes obtained from reduction mammoplasty specimens!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Whole genome amplification by GenomePlex (Sigma).!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens cut at 7-8Âµm were mounted on special foil-coated slides (Molecular Devices, San Diego, USA).

Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.15 and -0.15, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454655/suppl/GSM454655_MC_7079_7080_r_Cy3_22LIN_9203_06_Cy5_fpool_S61_140507.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18187!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio Cy5/Cy3#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	0.057	1199	229	521	65	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	222	228	67	62	-501_1_3_397B22	0.065	1885	228	845	64	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	507	224	135	65	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	1027	225	120	64	01_1_6_F0488J12	0.167	2963	221	1419	61	01_1_7_N0413M21	0.088	587	223	240	64	01_1_8_D2542F24	0.149	1264	220	591	62	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.065	870	221	364	62	01_1_10_N0673B19	0.027	828	221	335	63	01_1_11_N0090E12(del)	0.294	785	221	384	64	01_1_12_N0097G03	0.083	2338	229	1062	66	01_1_13_N1030C19	-0.132	1251	230	475	62	01_1_14_N0345M21	0.085	737	230	309	64	01_1_15_N0281A03	-0.065	1810	232	740	64	01_1_16_N0771D21	-0.046	1917	223	797	62	01_1_17_N0504D21	-0.002	1496	233	637	66	01_1_18_N0490A23	0.107	3818	228	1742	63	01_1_19_M2112G04	0.001	1015	231	413	65	01_1_20_N0282F14	0.063	3467	229	1540	64	0!sample_table_end
