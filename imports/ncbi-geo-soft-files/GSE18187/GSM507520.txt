The sections were then deparaffinized with Xylene, processed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and stained with haematoxylin. Lasercapture microdissection was performed at multiple sites using Veritas Arcturus. Cells were digested in 10 Âµl TE, pH 9, and 0.5 Âµl proteinase K (20 mg/ml) for 48h at 55Â°C. After inactivation of proteinase K at 99Â°C for 10 min, the digest was stored at -20Â°C. Without any further purification, the complete digest was used for whole genome amplification by means of the WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) kit from Sigma.!Sample_label_ch1 = Alexa Fluor 3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming according Invitrogens recommendation (Invitrogen BioPrime Total Genomic Labeling System).Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DNA pool isolated from laser captured microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy tissue.!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: mammary tissue without histomorphological changes obtained from reduction mammoplasty specimens!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Whole genome amplification by GenomePlex (Sigma).!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens cut at 7-8Âµm were mounted on special foil-coated slides (Molecular Devices, San Diego, USA).

Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.15 and -0.15, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM507nnn/GSM507520/suppl/GSM507520_MC_6669_6670_r_Cy3_1DIN131801_99_Cy5_fpool_S27_190906.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18187!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio Cy5/Cy3#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	-0.006	1563	226	502	66	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	631	232	209	70	01_1_3_397B22	0.289	1557	212	606	60	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	733	217	437	65	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	2044	215	1104	62	01_1_6_F0488J12	0.089	2427	210	782	59	01_1_7_N0413M21	-0.022	1021	214	338	61	01_1_8_D2542F24	-0.007	1029	215	344	59	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.135	1127	213	410	59	01_1_10_N0673B19	null	210	213	58	61	-501_1_11_N0090E12(del)	0.082	1257	215	435	58	01_1_12_N0097G03	0.247	424	207	174	55	01_1_13_N1030C19	0.288	1591	220	617	64	01_1_14_N0345M21	0.268	397	210	165	60	01_1_15_N0281A03	-0.134	2147	218	611	66	01_1_16_N0771D21	0.053	5146	220	1609	62	01_1_17_N0504D21	-0.034	1674	222	524	62	01_1_18_N0490A23	-0.027	2043	247	627	74	01_1_19_M2112G04	0.188	1027	240	391	74	01_1_20_N0282F14	null	240	237	72	69	-50!sample_table_end
