The sections were then deparaffinized with Xylene, processed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and stained with haematoxylin. Lasercapture microdissection for both lesions was performed at multiple sites using Veritas Arcturus. Cells were digested in 10Âµl TE, pH 9, and 0.5Âµl proteinase K (20mg/ml) for 48h at 55Â°C. After inactivation of proteinase K at 99Â°C for 10min, the digest was stored at -20Â°C.  Without any further purification, the complete digest was used for whole genome amplification by means of the WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) kit from Sigma.!Sample_label_ch1 = Alexa Fluor 3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming according Invitrogens recommendation (Invitrogen BioPrimeÂ® Total Genomic Labeling System).Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DNA pool isolated from laser captured microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy tissue.!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: mammary tissue without histomorphological changes obtained from reduction mammoplasty specimens!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Whole genome amplification by GenomePlex (Sigma).!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens cut at 7-8Âµm were mounted on special foil-coated slides (Molecular Devices, San Diego, USA).

Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.15 and -0.15, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454648/suppl/GSM454648_MC_6673_6674_r_Cy3_9LIN1921_01_Cy5_fpool_S29_190906.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18187!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio Cy5/Cy3#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	0.034	3586	235	1347	67	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	1422	235	542	66	01_1_3_397B22	-0.07	4370	234	1543	66	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	1737	254	572	75	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	5180	253	1635	74	01_1_6_F0488J12	-0.04	7018	235	2513	66	01_1_7_N0413M21	0.023	3239	244	1200	70	01_1_8_D2542F24	0.068	3072	238	1172	68	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.038	2717	243	1007	69	01_1_10_N0673B19	null	228	232	64	67	-501_1_11_N0090E12(del)	-0.011	2270	237	807	70	01_1_12_N0097G03	null	225	235	68	69	-501_1_13_N1030C19	-0.031	4882	237	1781	69	01_1_14_N0345M21	null	260	246	77	72	-501_1_15_N0281A03	0.047	5512	293	2113	89	01_1_16_N0771D21	0.097	7511	286	2957	85	01_1_17_N0504D21	0.053	4341	277	1674	83	01_1_18_N0490A23	-0.001	2943	413	1066	132	01_1_19_M2112G04	0.006	2583	275	934	84	01_1_20_N0282F14	null	235	235	69	71	-50!sample_table_end
