The sections were then deparaffinized with Xylene, processed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and stained with haematoxylin. Lasercapture microdissection for both lesions was performed at multiple sites using Veritas Arcturus. Cells were digested in 10Âµl TE, pH 9, and 0.5Âµl proteinase K (20mg/ml) for 48h at 55Â°C. After inactivation of proteinase K at 99Â°C for 10min, the digest was stored at -20Â°C.  Without any further purification, the complete digest was used for whole genome amplification by means of the WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) kit from Sigma.!Sample_label_ch1 = Alexa Fluor 3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming according Invitrogens recommendation (Invitrogen BioPrimeÂ® Total Genomic Labeling System).Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DNA pool isolated from laser captured microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy tissue.!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: mammary tissue without histomorphological changes obtained from reduction mammoplasty specimens!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Whole genome amplification by GenomePlex (Sigma).!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens cut at 7-8Âµm were mounted on special foil-coated slides (Molecular Devices, San Diego, USA).

Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.15 and -0.15, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454652/suppl/GSM454652_MC_6675_6676_r_Cy3_13LIN69092_03_Cy5_fpool_S30_190906.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18187!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio Cy5/Cy3#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	0.07	2120	205	869	72	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	780	217	328	74	01_1_3_397B22	-0.078	2371	225	879	82	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	1003	220	328	82	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	2909	221	824	75	01_1_6_F0488J12	-0.014	3419	232	1329	82	01_1_7_N0413M21	0.038	1388	239	551	86	01_1_8_D2542F24	0.061	1646	233	667	80	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.022	1436	217	564	73	01_1_10_N0673B19	0.051	329	213	120	71	01_1_11_N0090E12(del)	-0.01	1573	214	606	73	01_1_12_N0097G03	null	246	205	83	69	-501_1_13_N1030C19	-0.06	2528	218	952	76	01_1_14_N0345M21	null	250	233	85	84	-501_1_15_N0281A03	0.007	2764	240	1090	83	01_1_16_N0771D21	0.005	6123	231	2386	79	01_1_17_N0504D21	0.059	2332	212	952	71	01_1_18_N0490A23	-0.164	2815	221	986	73	01_1_19_M2112G04	0.025	1044	218	406	72	01_1_20_N0282F14	-0.119	254	226	80	77	0!sample_table_end
