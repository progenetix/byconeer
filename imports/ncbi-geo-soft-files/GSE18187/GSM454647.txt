The sections were then deparaffinized with Xylene, processed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and stained with haematoxylin. Lasercapture microdissection for both lesions was performed at multiple sites using Veritas Arcturus. Cells were digested in 10Âµl TE, pH 9, and 0.5Âµl proteinase K (20mg/ml) for 48h at 55Â°C. After inactivation of proteinase K at 99Â°C for 10min, the digest was stored at -20Â°C.  Without any further purification, the complete digest was used for whole genome amplification by means of the WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) kit from Sigma.!Sample_label_ch1 = Alexa Fluor 3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming according Invitrogens recommendation (Invitrogen BioPrimeÂ® Total Genomic Labeling System).Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DNA pool isolated from laser captured microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy tissue.!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: mammary tissue without histomorphological changes obtained from reduction mammoplasty specimens!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Whole genome amplification by GenomePlex (Sigma).!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens cut at 7-8Âµm were mounted on special foil-coated slides (Molecular Devices, San Diego, USA).

Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.15 and -0.15, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454647/suppl/GSM454647_MC_6677_6678_r_Cy3_LIN123549_03_Cy5_fpool_S31_190906.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18187!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio Cy5/Cy3#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	0.103	2283	246	830	71	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	982	252	320	70	01_1_3_397B22	null	3391	255	1100	72	-1001_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	1298	267	500	81	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	3112	248	1192	72	01_1_6_F0488J12	-0.067	4003	280	1275	80	01_1_7_N0413M21	0.061	1745	264	618	73	01_1_8_D2542F24	-0.027	1849	256	616	71	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.105	1769	250	646	66	01_1_10_N0673B19	null	239	242	63	61	-501_1_11_N0090E12(del)	-0.165	1648	242	501	62	01_1_12_N0097G03	null	236	250	59	67	-501_1_13_N1030C19	0.017	2717	276	928	74	01_1_14_N0345M21	-0.131	333	277	98	73	01_1_15_N0281A03	0.059	3068	243	1068	63	01_1_16_N0771D21	0.043	7112	257	2499	68	01_1_17_N0504D21	0.037	2826	255	976	66	01_1_18_N0490A23	-0.132	2987	255	917	69	01_1_19_M2112G04	0.112	1552	269	571	73	01_1_20_N0282F14	null	247	271	63	78	-50!sample_table_end
