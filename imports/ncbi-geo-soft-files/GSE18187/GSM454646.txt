The sections were then deparaffinized with Xylene, processed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and stained with haematoxylin. Lasercapture microdissection for both lesions was performed at multiple sites using Veritas Arcturus. Cells were digested in 10Âµl TE, pH 9, and 0.5Âµl proteinase K (20mg/ml) for 48h at 55Â°C. After inactivation of proteinase K at 99Â°C for 10min, the digest was stored at -20Â°C.  Without any further purification, the complete digest was used for whole genome amplification by means of the WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) kit from Sigma.!Sample_label_ch1 = Alexa Fluor 3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming according Invitrogens recommendation (Invitrogen BioPrimeÂ® Total Genomic Labeling System).Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DNA pool isolated from laser captured microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy tissue.!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: mammary tissue without histomorphological changes obtained from reduction mammoplasty specimens!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Whole genome amplification by GenomePlex (Sigma).!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens cut at 7-8Âµm were mounted on special foil-coated slides (Molecular Devices, San Diego, USA).

Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.15 and -0.15, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454646/suppl/GSM454646_MC_6103_6104_r_Cy3_LIN24519_03_Cy5_291_S74_201106.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18187!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio Cy5/Cy3#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	0.036	1524	147	1186	78	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	150	143	79	74	-501_1_3_397B22	0.09	1829	150	1483	72	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	1150	142	930	72	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	2400	143	2243	74	01_1_6_F0488J12	-0.026	2135	144	1592	74	01_1_7_N0413M21	-0.047	1300	144	960	76	01_1_8_D2542F24	-0.016	1585	146	1191	78	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.131	1270	147	1059	79	01_1_10_N0673B19	-0.147	1315	145	908	77	01_1_11_N0090E12(del)	-0.097	164	147	92	79	01_1_12_N0097G03	null	141	149	71	78	-501_1_13_N1030C19	0.245	1867	146	1679	78	01_1_14_N0345M21	null	142	146	76	79	-501_1_15_N0281A03	null	136	146	69	78	-501_1_16_N0771D21	0.097	2768	151	2260	74	01_1_17_N0504D21	0.027	2023	158	1563	82	01_1_18_N0490A23	-0.295	5082	147	3095	83	01_1_19_M2112G04	0.07	948	149	777	79	01_1_20_N0282F14	null	481	163	321	94	-100!sample_table_end
