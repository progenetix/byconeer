The sections were then deparaffinized with Xylene, processed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and stained with haematoxylin. Lasercapture microdissection for both lesions was performed at multiple sites using Veritas Arcturus. Cells were digested in 10Âµl TE, pH 9, and 0.5Âµl proteinase K (20mg/ml) for 48h at 55Â°C. After inactivation of proteinase K at 99Â°C for 10min, the digest was stored at -20Â°C.  Without any further purification, the complete digest was used for whole genome amplification by means of the WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) kit from Sigma.!Sample_label_ch1 = Alexa Fluor 3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming according Invitrogens recommendation (Invitrogen BioPrimeÂ® Total Genomic Labeling System).Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DNA pool isolated from laser captured microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy tissue.!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: mammary tissue without histomorphological changes obtained from reduction mammoplasty specimens!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Whole genome amplification by GenomePlex (Sigma).!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens cut at 7-8Âµm were mounted on special foil-coated slides (Molecular Devices, San Diego, USA).

Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.15 and -0.15, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454650/suppl/GSM454650_MC_6625_6626_r_Cy3_7LIN123644_01_Cy5_fpool_S69_120207.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18187!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio Cy5/Cy3#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	null	464	163	341	74	-1001_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	243	164	117	77	-1001_1_3_397B22	null	610	161	387	66	-1001_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	160	157	65	61	-1001_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	678	224	323	124	-1001_1_6_F0488J12	null	957	216	690	115	-1001_1_7_N0413M21	null	529	155	317	53	-1001_1_8_D2542F24	null	508	156	322	55	-1001_1_9_N0137H06	null	469	156	256	54	-1001_1_10_N0673B19	null	168	153	71	53	-1001_1_11_N0090E12(del)	null	175	153	58	51	-1001_1_12_N0097G03	null	772	162	1277	61	-1001_1_13_N1030C19	null	1193	159	658	54	-1001_1_14_N0345M21	null	154	155	53	52	-1001_1_15_N0281A03	null	212	157	84	54	-1001_1_16_N0771D21	null	156	222	50	94	-1001_1_17_N0504D21	null	374	175	194	59	-1001_1_18_N0490A23	-0.036	1602	157	932	53	01_1_19_M2112G04	-0.046	540	157	259	54	01_1_20_N0282F14	null	156	159	53	55	-50!sample_table_end
