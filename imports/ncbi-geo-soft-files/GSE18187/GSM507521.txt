The sections were then deparaffinized with Xylene, processed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and stained with haematoxylin. Lasercapture microdissection was performed at multiple sites using Veritas Arcturus. Cells were digested in 10 Âµl TE, pH 9, and 0.5 Âµl proteinase K (20 mg/ml) for 48h at 55Â°C. After inactivation of proteinase K at 99Â°C for 10 min, the digest was stored at -20Â°C. Without any further purification, the complete digest was used for whole genome amplification by means of the WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) kit from Sigma.!Sample_label_ch1 = Alexa Fluor 3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming according Invitrogens recommendation (Invitrogen BioPrime Total Genomic Labeling System).Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DNA pool isolated from laser captured microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy tissue.!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: mammary tissue without histomorphological changes obtained from reduction mammoplasty specimens!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Whole genome amplification by GenomePlex (Sigma).!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens cut at 7-8Âµm were mounted on special foil-coated slides (Molecular Devices, San Diego, USA).

Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.15 and -0.15, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM507nnn/GSM507521/suppl/GSM507521_MC_7089_7090_r_Cy3_29DIN_46998_01_Cy5_fpool_S62_140507.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18187!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio Cy5/Cy3#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	0.249	666	219	399	65	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	284	210	86	66	01_1_3_397B22	0.061	1377	218	779	64	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	466	219	135	63	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	590	215	98	61	01_1_6_F0488J12	0.144	3427	221	2085	63	01_1_7_N0413M21	0.297	335	223	172	63	01_1_8_D2542F24	0.07	815	213	442	62	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.052	608	214	309	63	01_1_10_N0673B19	0.083	551	213	281	61	01_1_11_N0090E12(del)	0.192	528	219	290	61	01_1_12_N0097G03	0.108	1644	223	963	63	01_1_13_N1030C19	-0.051	777	224	382	63	01_1_14_N0345M21	0.124	447	224	223	65	01_1_15_N0281A03	-0.008	1364	228	736	66	01_1_16_N0771D21	-0.008	1198	230	641	66	01_1_17_N0504D21	0.025	729	222	375	63	01_1_18_N0490A23	0.052	3077	223	1753	62	01_1_19_M2112G04	-0.098	542	222	239	63	01_1_20_N0282F14	0.091	1235	221	712	65	0!sample_table_end
