The sections were then deparaffinized with Xylene, processed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and stained with haematoxylin. Lasercapture microdissection for both lesions was performed at multiple sites using Veritas Arcturus. Cells were digested in 10Âµl TE, pH 9, and 0.5Âµl proteinase K (20mg/ml) for 48h at 55Â°C. After inactivation of proteinase K at 99Â°C for 10min, the digest was stored at -20Â°C.  Without any further purification, the complete digest was used for whole genome amplification by means of the WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) kit from Sigma.!Sample_label_ch1 = Alexa Fluor 3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming according Invitrogens recommendation (Invitrogen BioPrimeÂ® Total Genomic Labeling System).Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DNA pool isolated from laser captured microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy tissue.!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: mammary tissue without histomorphological changes obtained from reduction mammoplasty specimens!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Whole genome amplification by GenomePlex (Sigma).!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens cut at 7-8Âµm were mounted on special foil-coated slides (Molecular Devices, San Diego, USA).

Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.15 and -0.15, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454617/suppl/GSM454617_MC_6671_6672_r_Cy3_2LIN121801_99_Cy5_fpool_S28_190906.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18187!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio Cy5/Cy3#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	-0.025	2671	257	809	63	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	1012	251	304	64	01_1_3_397B22	0.155	3414	243	1149	63	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	1346	247	569	65	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	2908	267	1131	73	01_1_6_F0488J12	0.041	4330	262	1356	72	01_1_7_N0413M21	0.042	1886	242	611	69	01_1_8_D2542F24	-0.017	1777	239	555	69	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.176	2155	234	759	62	01_1_10_N0673B19	null	235	242	62	68	-501_1_11_N0090E12(del)	0.052	1740	240	570	67	01_1_12_N0097G03	null	224	234	59	65	-501_1_13_N1030C19	0.193	2796	241	975	70	01_1_14_N0345M21	null	270	239	73	69	-501_1_15_N0281A03	-0.096	3128	243	892	69	01_1_16_N0771D21	-0.001	7444	244	2296	76	01_1_17_N0504D21	-0.03	2751	240	829	75	01_1_18_N0490A23	-0.05	2990	237	882	67	01_1_19_M2112G04	0.099	1390	242	476	73	01_1_20_N0282F14	null	232	233	64	69	-50!sample_table_end
