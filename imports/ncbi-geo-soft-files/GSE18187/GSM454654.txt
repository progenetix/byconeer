The sections were then deparaffinized with Xylene, processed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and stained with haematoxylin. Lasercapture microdissection for both lesions was performed at multiple sites using Veritas Arcturus. Cells were digested in 10Âµl TE, pH 9, and 0.5Âµl proteinase K (20mg/ml) for 48h at 55Â°C. After inactivation of proteinase K at 99Â°C for 10min, the digest was stored at -20Â°C.  Without any further purification, the complete digest was used for whole genome amplification by means of the WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) kit from Sigma.!Sample_label_ch1 = Alexa Fluor 3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming according Invitrogens recommendation (Invitrogen BioPrimeÂ® Total Genomic Labeling System).Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DNA pool isolated from laser captured microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy tissue.!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: mammary tissue without histomorphological changes obtained from reduction mammoplasty specimens!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Whole genome amplification by GenomePlex (Sigma).!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens cut at 7-8Âµm were mounted on special foil-coated slides (Molecular Devices, San Diego, USA).

Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.15 and -0.15, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM454nnn/GSM454654/suppl/GSM454654_MC_7077_7078_r_Cy3_17LIN_3976_07_Cy5_fpool_S59_140507.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18187!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio Cy5/Cy3#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	0.621	398	193	343	65	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	192	187	65	64	01_1_3_397B22	0.318	793	191	590	64	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	296	197	105	66	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	417	193	91	65	01_1_6_F0488J12	0.026	2341	193	1414	61	01_1_7_N0413M21	0.614	231	211	149	68	01_1_8_D2542F24	-0.078	678	206	374	67	01_1_9_N0137H06	0.351	350	197	231	63	01_1_10_N0673B19	0.437	354	193	253	60	01_1_11_N0090E12(del)	0.293	439	199	300	65	01_1_12_N0097G03	0.464	961	211	792	68	01_1_13_N1030C19	0.176	447	198	280	63	01_1_14_N0345M21	0.596	304	200	231	63	01_1_15_N0281A03	0.267	830	195	597	61	01_1_16_N0771D21	0.086	857	192	543	61	01_1_17_N0504D21	0.218	523	201	351	63	01_1_18_N0490A23	-0.081	2319	189	1301	60	01_1_19_M2112G04	-0.114	476	190	241	61	01_1_20_N0282F14	0.288	869	198	635	64	0!sample_table_end
