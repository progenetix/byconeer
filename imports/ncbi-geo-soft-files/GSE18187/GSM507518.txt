The sections were then deparaffinized with Xylene, processed in decreasing concentrations of ethanol and stained with haematoxylin. Lasercapture microdissection was performed at multiple sites using Veritas Arcturus. Cells were digested in 10 Âµl TE, pH 9, and 0.5 Âµl proteinase K (20 mg/ml) for 48h at 55Â°C. After inactivation of proteinase K at 99Â°C for 10 min, the digest was stored at -20Â°C. Without any further purification, the complete digest was used for whole genome amplification by means of the WGA (Whole Genome Amplification) kit from Sigma.!Sample_label_ch1 = Alexa Fluor 3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled by random priming according Invitrogens recommendation (Invitrogen BioPrime Total Genomic Labeling System).Detailed protocols are available at our website (Molecular Cytogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DNA pool isolated from laser captured microdissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy tissue.!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: mammary tissue without histomorphological changes obtained from reduction mammoplasty specimens!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Whole genome amplification by GenomePlex (Sigma).!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens cut at 7-8Âµm were mounted on special foil-coated slides (Molecular Devices, San Diego, USA).

Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgridd LOWESS. Aberrations were defined by Circular Binary Segmentation in combination with log2 ratio threshold of 0.15 and -0.15, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5114!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM507nnn/GSM507518/suppl/GSM507518_MC_7145_7146_r_Cy3_32DIN_123549_03_Cy5_fpool_S19_290507.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18187!Sample_data_row_count = 41760#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio Cy5/Cy3#f635Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy5#b635Mean = background signal intensity Cy5#f532Mean = foreground signal intensity Cy3#b532Mean = background signal intensity Cy3#Flags = 0: valid spots -50: clones with unverified chromosomal positions -100: excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	f635Mean	b635Mean	f532Mean	b532Mean	Flags1_1_1_bK1444N24	0.056	931	144	548	51	01_1_2_Buffer_PCR	null	153	149	54	53	-501_1_3_397B22	0.149	1447	144	947	52	01_1_4_Buffer_PCR	null	421	145	194	53	01_1_5_Buffer_PCR	null	590	153	188	58	01_1_6_F0488J12	0.034	2135	140	1321	51	01_1_7_N0413M21	0.074	587	139	318	51	01_1_8_D2542F24	null	1077	152	622	54	-1001_1_9_N0137H06	0.062	684	154	380	56	01_1_10_N0673B19	-0.025	144	142	52	52	01_1_11_N0090E12(del)	0.259	642	139	409	51	01_1_12_N0097G03	0.106	2599	144	1703	50	01_1_13_N1030C19	-0.015	1175	149	672	53	01_1_14_N0345M21	0.015	740	145	403	55	01_1_15_N0281A03	-0.114	1709	155	940	56	01_1_16_N0771D21	-0.079	2146	155	1227	56	01_1_17_N0504D21	-0.014	1255	146	721	53	01_1_18_N0490A23	-0.025	3567	152	2166	54	01_1_19_M2112G04	-0.067	796	158	414	58	01_1_20_N0282F14	-0.226	2522	163	1306	59	0!sample_table_end
