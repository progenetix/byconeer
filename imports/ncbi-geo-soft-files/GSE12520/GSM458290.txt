After overnight incubation at 37Â°C, the labelled DNA were purified using a G-50 spin column (GE Healthcare).!Sample_hyb_protocol = The purified DNA from test and reference were pooled and mixed with 45Âµg of Cot1 DNA and ethanol precipitated. The precipitated DNA was dissolved in 30Âµl of hybridisation buffer, incubated at 37ËC for 2 hours and applied to the prehybridised microarray. Hybridisation was performed in a humidified Micro Array Hybridisation Chamber (Camlab, Cambridge, UK) at 37ËC for 48 hours under a coverslip. The arrays were then washed successively in 1x PBS/0.05% Tween20 at room temperature for 15 min twice, 50% formamide/2xSSC at 42ËC for 30 min once, 1x PBS/0.05% Tween20 at room temperature for 15min and 1x PBS for 5min twice.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4100A personal scanner.!Sample_scan_protocol = Images were quantified using GenePix Pro version 5.1.!Sample_description = Log2 tumour/reference intensity ratios for analysis of copy number variations!Sample_data_processing = The median of the ratio of test/reference spot intensity, after subtraction of local background, of the 5Mb-clones in each subarray was used as the normalization factor. The chromosomal arm on which most microsatellite markers showed allelic balance was chosen for normalization. The test/reference ratio of each clone was divided by the normalization factor for each subarray, an average of the duplicate calculated and log2-transformed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9336!Sample_contact_name = George,,Poulogiannis!Sample_contact_email = George_Poulogiannis@hms.harvard.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 001-617-677-8315!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Cambridge!Sample_contact_address = Tennis Court Road!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB2 1QP!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM458nnn/GSM458290/suppl/GSM458290.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12520!Sample_data_row_count = 3735#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 ratio (Cy5/Cy3)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	0.0482608612	-0.0654705023	-0.0433617494	0.0405361985	-0.0612688366	0.0678468377	0.0669898038	0.0792018459	-0.13788561310	0.01449836911	-0.07822797512	-0.00089323913	0.02969324414	0.02218227815	-0.00321332216	-0.07570581717	-0.0065650418	-0.06702594419	-0.0191016420	-0.062615299!sample_table_end
