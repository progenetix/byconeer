Slide pretreatment included (a) stripping: 2.5 mmol/L Na2HPO4, 0.1% SDS at 76Â°C for 1 min; (b) slide blocking: 3% bovine serum albumin (fraction V; Sigma-Aldrich), 5Ã SSC, 0.2% SDS at 42Â°C for 20 min; and (c) prehybridization: 400 Î¼g of salmon testes DNA and 67.5 Î¼g of COT human DNA in 200 Î¼L of hybridization solution incubated 1 h at 37Â°C.  Hybridization was performed during 18 h at 37Â°C under low agitation.Four posthybridization washes were performed: 50% formamide, 2Ã SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45Â°C for 37 sec, four times; 2Ã SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45Â°C for 37 sec, four times; 4Ã SSC, 0.1 Tween 20 at 45Â°C for 37 sec, four times; slides were finally nitrogen-dried.!Sample_scan_protocol = ScanArray 4000 (Packard Bioscience, Meriden, CT).
