LCIS and invasive components were identified and microdissected using laser capture microdissection on the PixCell II. Captured cells were incubated in 50 mL of Proteinase K extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Tween-20) for 72 hours at 55Â°C. Proteinase K was inactivated by incubation at 95Â°C for 10 minutes prior to use for PCR. Degenerate oligonucleotide primed (DOP) PCR was performed according to the usual protocol. Briefly, 10-100ng of DNA was amplified by Thermo Sequenase DNA Polymerase in a low stringency pre-amplification step (5 cycles) followed by regular PCR amplification in less stringent conditions. Several DOP-PCR reactions were pooled from each sample (to reduce the effect of bias on each sample) and cleaned by phenol:chloroform extraction prior to quantification and labeling. The resulting DNA was quantified using a DynaQuant 200 Fluorometer).!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 2-3 mg of pooled DOP-PCR products from each sample as well as an equal amount of reference DNA was labelled by random priming in 3 separate reactions with either Cy3 or Cy5.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = FFPE lymph nodes, pooled!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: pooled lymph nodes!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = 5 mm sections were cut from the FFPE samples and prepared for microdissection.

Slides were rinsed in 0.1X SSC to remove the cover slips and then washed 3 times in 0.1X SSC/0.1% SDS for 10 minutes at room temperature. Slides were rinsed once in 1X SSC and twice in 0.1X SSC and centrifuged to dryness.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned using the GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments, USA). The PMT gain for each laser was adjusted to give an average ratio of Cy3 to Cy5 of 1.0 and to minimize the number of saturated pixels. Images were then analyzed using the GenePix Pro 3.0 software.!Sample_description = ilc1a.gpr!Sample_description = ilc1b.gpr!Sample_data_processing = The resulting data were normalized using the printTipLoess algorithm in Bioconductor genomic analysis software package available on line at: http://www.bioconductor.org/. The data was normalized within each subarray as well as for the entire array. The values for the foreground and background for the duplicate spots were first averaged. Then the gene amplification level was calculated as the log base 2 of the ratio of the test to normal of the differences between foreground and background. The gene amplification level for each âfluor-flipâ experiment was averaged and filtered to exclude cDNA clones without mapping info.!Sample_platform_id = GPL10093!Sample_contact_name = Susan,,Done!Sample_contact_email = sdone@uhnres.utoronto.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University Health Network!Sample_contact_address = 200 Elizabeth Street, 11E444!Sample_contact_city = Toronto!Sample_contact_state = ON!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = M5G2C4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM513nnn/GSM513689/suppl/GSM513689_ilc1a.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM513nnn/GSM513689/suppl/GSM513689_ilc1b.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20474!Sample_data_row_count = 10490#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (Cy5/Cy3)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	-0.282456082	-0.7670990053	-0.1598296164	-0.467107345	-0.5523524916	-0.7072024447	-0.4260483118	-0.5206340379	-0.68235793110	-0.34373017111	-0.12261517412	-0.50698573613	-0.39899579314	-0.05741438815	-0.60419282616	-0.60419282617	-0.60419282618	-0.7867532719	-0.57921444320	-0.28696793!sample_table_end
