GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.!Sample_scan_protocol = Human Mapping 250K NspI arrays were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix).!Sample_description = main IgH chromosomal translocations t(11;14), t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20)!Sample_description = Genome-wide profiling data from Primary Plasma Cell Leukemia PCL-017!Sample_data_processing = Images were acquired using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Operating System (GCOS 1.4). The raw data for individual SNPs were extracted from CEL files and converted into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares using the Hidden Markov Model algorithm with a genomic smoothing window set to 0. After the pre-processing, piecewise constant estimates of the underlying local DNA copy number (CN) variation was calculated using the DNAcopy Bioconductor package, which looks for optimal breakpoints using circular binary segmentation (CBS), (Olshen et al., Biostatistics 2004) and the median of the estimated probes was scaled back to a nominal multiplicity of two. After scaling, a k-means clustering algorithm was used on the cumulative profile of all the data to determine the thresholds for inferring discrete CN values. Inferred CN higher than 2.2, 2.5 and 3.4 corresponded to 3, 4 and 5 or more copies whereas CN below 1.7 and 1.3 to loss and biallelic deletion, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Luca,,Agnelli!Sample_contact_email = luca.agnelli@unimi.it, katiatodoerti@gmail.com!Sample_contact_phone = +390255033328!Sample_contact_department = Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology - Hematology 1!Sample_contact_institute = University of Milan - Fondazione IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico!Sample_contact_address = Francesco Sforza, 35!Sample_contact_city = MILAN!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20122!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM967nnn/GSM967084/suppl/GSM967084_PCL-017_GWP.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE39380!Sample_series_id = GSE39383!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = Inferred copy number calculated using  circular binary segmentation (CBS) method!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1886933	1.502119927SNP_A-1902458	1.502119927SNP_A-2131660	1.502119927SNP_A-4221087	1.502119927SNP_A-1884606	1.502119927SNP_A-2235839	1.502119927SNP_A-2218153	1.502119927SNP_A-1919019	1.502119927SNP_A-1815933	1.502119927SNP_A-2115098	1.502119927SNP_A-2264565	1.502119927SNP_A-1788728	1.502119927SNP_A-4218776	1.502119927SNP_A-2082194	1.502119927SNP_A-2135694	1.502119927SNP_A-4220764	1.502119927SNP_A-1796345	1.502119927SNP_A-1789472	1.502119927SNP_A-1934233	1.502119927SNP_A-4207031	1.502119927!sample_table_end
