Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837850/suppl/GSM837850_SNP6.0_WE066.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.28250930624084SNP_A-1780271	7.65105169117893SNP_A-1780272	9.25266543245025SNP_A-1780274	8.96626510287713SNP_A-1780277	9.63602035036062SNP_A-1780278	7.54109661534952SNP_A-1780283	8.42783660345852SNP_A-1780285	8.84025340257823SNP_A-1780286	7.87446911791614SNP_A-1780287	8.2272148047933SNP_A-1780289	9.00796165490648SNP_A-1780290	8.71367290601308SNP_A-1780292	8.33240957875568SNP_A-1780293	9.73668379027023SNP_A-1780294	8.86624861111117SNP_A-1780295	9.54625140436512SNP_A-1780299	9.91139198784346SNP_A-1780300	7.9188632372746SNP_A-1780301	7.79522796602868SNP_A-1780302	7.83130724380205!sample_table_end
