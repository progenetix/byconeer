Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837664/suppl/GSM837664_SNP6.0_EA026.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.86341195894164SNP_A-1780271	7.17117679765177SNP_A-1780272	8.47910657966435SNP_A-1780274	8.50647288560245SNP_A-1780277	9.67595703294175SNP_A-1780278	7.12153351734003SNP_A-1780283	7.80654962198596SNP_A-1780285	8.62692579382485SNP_A-1780286	7.28386005405384SNP_A-1780287	8.18817670599854SNP_A-1780289	8.3937479583852SNP_A-1780290	8.56541946809669SNP_A-1780292	8.33613458738564SNP_A-1780293	9.35204342579543SNP_A-1780294	8.92629599478111SNP_A-1780295	9.10022429587419SNP_A-1780299	9.6275338844728SNP_A-1780300	7.54560806208427SNP_A-1780301	7.50382573799575SNP_A-1780302	7.56414948998573!sample_table_end
