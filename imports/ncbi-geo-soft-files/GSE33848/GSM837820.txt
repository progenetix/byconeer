Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837820/suppl/GSM837820_SNP6.0_WE036.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	9.1630206395808SNP_A-1780271	8.01611183822051SNP_A-1780272	9.57774351776126SNP_A-1780274	9.85148879156582SNP_A-1780277	10.5838662873402SNP_A-1780278	8.49235394515987SNP_A-1780283	9.32361776329158SNP_A-1780285	9.58245564511058SNP_A-1780286	8.25108785433692SNP_A-1780287	8.87753977187611SNP_A-1780289	9.50250034052918SNP_A-1780290	9.16658155836794SNP_A-1780292	9.3779335046161SNP_A-1780293	10.2665913577086SNP_A-1780294	9.41256984680521SNP_A-1780295	9.8747252555184SNP_A-1780299	10.8265484872909SNP_A-1780300	8.7758845834585SNP_A-1780301	8.77643303244473SNP_A-1780302	8.41574176829009!sample_table_end
