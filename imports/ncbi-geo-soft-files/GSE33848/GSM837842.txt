Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837842/suppl/GSM837842_SNP6.0_WE058.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.26561504648446SNP_A-1780271	7.73470962022584SNP_A-1780272	8.86830813328947SNP_A-1780274	9.15860968821448SNP_A-1780277	9.64895670786582SNP_A-1780278	7.3094763538411SNP_A-1780283	8.13185696060879SNP_A-1780285	8.8538293518571SNP_A-1780286	7.64745842645492SNP_A-1780287	8.19803570819926SNP_A-1780289	8.58683978796183SNP_A-1780290	8.36267443723067SNP_A-1780292	7.99341019063965SNP_A-1780293	9.33799349118732SNP_A-1780294	8.64084743990239SNP_A-1780295	9.4335854411505SNP_A-1780299	9.74062404448941SNP_A-1780300	7.71995916886051SNP_A-1780301	8.17367713630342SNP_A-1780302	7.80251636512122!sample_table_end
