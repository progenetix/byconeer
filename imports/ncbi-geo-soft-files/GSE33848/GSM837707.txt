Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837707/suppl/GSM837707_SNP6.0_EA110.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.96181140808716SNP_A-1780271	8.08414401061514SNP_A-1780272	9.38945208908437SNP_A-1780274	9.48112668973662SNP_A-1780277	10.1867332891289SNP_A-1780278	7.98370619265935SNP_A-1780283	8.67109872574846SNP_A-1780285	8.9282716130849SNP_A-1780286	7.96000193206808SNP_A-1780287	8.73809225962049SNP_A-1780289	9.1176431013891SNP_A-1780290	8.92382266134336SNP_A-1780292	8.71596199025514SNP_A-1780293	9.41009796631156SNP_A-1780294	9.3955341354623SNP_A-1780295	9.7310361219074SNP_A-1780299	10.7816329253503SNP_A-1780300	8.3151495622563SNP_A-1780301	8.18858884570735SNP_A-1780302	8.19721669311005!sample_table_end
