Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837716/suppl/GSM837716_SNP6.0_EA126.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.76071994746562SNP_A-1780271	7.34429590791582SNP_A-1780272	8.38154295118458SNP_A-1780274	8.450523950571SNP_A-1780277	8.64144969206763SNP_A-1780278	7.03754695396218SNP_A-1780283	7.64835758200967SNP_A-1780285	8.00375213486111SNP_A-1780286	6.72337652941826SNP_A-1780287	7.92580166719674SNP_A-1780289	7.86933679289874SNP_A-1780290	7.39945595807998SNP_A-1780292	7.54817971167945SNP_A-1780293	8.56541946809669SNP_A-1780294	8.56668832925227SNP_A-1780295	8.96000193206808SNP_A-1780299	9.19967234483636SNP_A-1780300	6.7279204545632SNP_A-1780301	7.62570884306447SNP_A-1780302	6.95274124718649!sample_table_end
