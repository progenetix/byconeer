Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837676/suppl/GSM837676_SNP6.0_EA049.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.39981195932568SNP_A-1780271	6.967226258836SNP_A-1780272	8.70217268536555SNP_A-1780274	8.68182403997375SNP_A-1780277	9.59058704991503SNP_A-1780278	6.9351650496037SNP_A-1780283	7.57648434679685SNP_A-1780285	8.29155444584384SNP_A-1780286	7.4594316186373SNP_A-1780287	8.82495874052852SNP_A-1780289	8.18817670599854SNP_A-1780290	8.35681874155737SNP_A-1780292	7.82442843541655SNP_A-1780293	9.03663153829639SNP_A-1780294	9.17990909001493SNP_A-1780295	9.09011241966429SNP_A-1780299	9.58840233012788SNP_A-1780300	7.84862294042934SNP_A-1780301	7.80896417491926SNP_A-1780302	7.1098306542788!sample_table_end
