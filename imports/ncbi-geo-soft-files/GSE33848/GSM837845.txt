Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837845/suppl/GSM837845_SNP6.0_WE061.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.20395970323946SNP_A-1780271	7.25620868852739SNP_A-1780272	8.72223830841965SNP_A-1780274	8.9331988550358SNP_A-1780277	9.599602951725SNP_A-1780278	7.34872815423108SNP_A-1780283	8.05188865590538SNP_A-1780285	8.74595437739346SNP_A-1780286	7.66533591718518SNP_A-1780287	8.17741953798924SNP_A-1780289	8.52290841355846SNP_A-1780290	8.9183663559055SNP_A-1780292	8.29462074889163SNP_A-1780293	9.22359952923637SNP_A-1780294	8.93614714293017SNP_A-1780295	9.22761594341422SNP_A-1780299	10.2031440452441SNP_A-1780300	7.60856285978006SNP_A-1780301	7.6838718686226SNP_A-1780302	7.90689059560852!sample_table_end
