Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837680/suppl/GSM837680_SNP6.0_EA057.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	6.92035285541508SNP_A-1780271	6.403012023575SNP_A-1780272	7.87139191438713SNP_A-1780274	7.9705852709259SNP_A-1780277	8.6060967138105SNP_A-1780278	6.1006623390052SNP_A-1780283	7.15860968821448SNP_A-1780285	7.9867901427824SNP_A-1780286	6.45121111183233SNP_A-1780287	7.82336724004623SNP_A-1780289	7.98963102661646SNP_A-1780290	7.7279204545632SNP_A-1780292	7.32942263143428SNP_A-1780293	8.79333235519074SNP_A-1780294	8.09978611970047SNP_A-1780295	8.77533592589689SNP_A-1780299	9.11243950678155SNP_A-1780300	6.8621207254885SNP_A-1780301	6.79928162152192SNP_A-1780302	6.4178525148859!sample_table_end
