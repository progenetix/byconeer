Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837706/suppl/GSM837706_SNP6.0_EA108.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.57553924683453SNP_A-1780271	8.1817734388088SNP_A-1780272	9.4484605008163SNP_A-1780274	9.46896338080995SNP_A-1780277	10.0081951573818SNP_A-1780278	7.88034880815603SNP_A-1780283	8.72109918870719SNP_A-1780285	8.99388189083705SNP_A-1780286	7.42766203814391SNP_A-1780287	9.04757837582573SNP_A-1780289	8.8238979353036SNP_A-1780290	8.90839262077375SNP_A-1780292	8.49718654063271SNP_A-1780293	9.75877841775104SNP_A-1780294	9.38118241262445SNP_A-1780295	9.4189067312579SNP_A-1780299	10.3688701814241SNP_A-1780300	7.59121064838633SNP_A-1780301	8.48028532093637SNP_A-1780302	8.26385601959608!sample_table_end
