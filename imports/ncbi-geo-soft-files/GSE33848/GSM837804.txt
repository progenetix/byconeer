Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837804/suppl/GSM837804_SNP6.0_WE020.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.10787091427961SNP_A-1780271	7.50977500432694SNP_A-1780272	8.33985000288462SNP_A-1780274	8.57364718749332SNP_A-1780277	9.09055354336162SNP_A-1780278	7.22881869049588SNP_A-1780283	7.96361861744397SNP_A-1780285	8.71310006699786SNP_A-1780286	7.2078277935799SNP_A-1780287	8.33762190199251SNP_A-1780289	8.55266909751427SNP_A-1780290	8.03066713624694SNP_A-1780292	8.14210705730255SNP_A-1780293	9.2463447430809SNP_A-1780294	8.86676376735335SNP_A-1780295	9.32755264408124SNP_A-1780299	9.65642486327778SNP_A-1780300	7.7714894695006SNP_A-1780301	7.69087100929231SNP_A-1780302	7.41996017784789!sample_table_end
