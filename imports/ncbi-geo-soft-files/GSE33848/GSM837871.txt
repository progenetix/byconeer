Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837871/suppl/GSM837871_SNP6.0_WE102.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.97010589061218SNP_A-1780271	6.70217268536555SNP_A-1780272	8.1963972128035SNP_A-1780274	7.99057674611337SNP_A-1780277	9.08569374839728SNP_A-1780278	7.01820017881323SNP_A-1780283	7.319672120947SNP_A-1780285	7.78899015464904SNP_A-1780286	6.80305478462398SNP_A-1780287	7.620830748676SNP_A-1780289	7.88060390408824SNP_A-1780290	7.4797802640291SNP_A-1780292	7.50647288560245SNP_A-1780293	8.71195370615813SNP_A-1780294	7.98868468677217SNP_A-1780295	8.94202570471085SNP_A-1780299	9.12282799480767SNP_A-1780300	6.876516946565SNP_A-1780301	7.08746284125034SNP_A-1780302	6.84549005094437!sample_table_end
