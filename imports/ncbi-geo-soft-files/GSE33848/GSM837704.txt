Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837704/suppl/GSM837704_SNP6.0_EA098.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.85798099512757SNP_A-1780271	7.79603960882977SNP_A-1780272	8.66415095199257SNP_A-1780274	9.23641289165138SNP_A-1780277	8.90036368851937SNP_A-1780278	7.81378119121704SNP_A-1780283	8.55746370159782SNP_A-1780285	9.18404882037586SNP_A-1780286	7.29155444584385SNP_A-1780287	8.74651432113846SNP_A-1780289	8.56096964509936SNP_A-1780290	8.25660184700942SNP_A-1780292	8.29001884693262SNP_A-1780293	9.6060967138105SNP_A-1780294	9.4898479604393SNP_A-1780295	9.32942263143429SNP_A-1780299	10.4053187746392SNP_A-1780300	7.87753977187611SNP_A-1780301	8.10787091427961SNP_A-1780302	7.87190523765919!sample_table_end
