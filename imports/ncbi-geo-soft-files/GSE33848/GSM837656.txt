Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837656/suppl/GSM837656_SNP6.0_EA016.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.09737376899022SNP_A-1780271	7.1395513523988SNP_A-1780272	8.9371285681659SNP_A-1780274	8.66059020553453SNP_A-1780277	9.24871824793358SNP_A-1780278	7.2131042196419SNP_A-1780283	8.06339508128851SNP_A-1780285	8.8035930032614SNP_A-1780286	7.07859560349612SNP_A-1780287	8.5189809291704SNP_A-1780289	8.71080643369935SNP_A-1780290	8.85278957160244SNP_A-1780292	8.5018371849023SNP_A-1780293	9.77066389291676SNP_A-1780294	8.93418228727626SNP_A-1780295	9.46828462519127SNP_A-1780299	9.9834686924463SNP_A-1780300	7.81057163474115SNP_A-1780301	7.71338651493703SNP_A-1780302	7.64205169292798!sample_table_end
