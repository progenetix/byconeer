Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837857/suppl/GSM837857_SNP6.0_WE073.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	6.98726401207254SNP_A-1780271	6.41362792902417SNP_A-1780272	7.31590430725959SNP_A-1780274	7.58245564511058SNP_A-1780277	8.38010025602347SNP_A-1780278	6.37721053038855SNP_A-1780283	6.8703647195834SNP_A-1780285	7.4484605008163SNP_A-1780286	6.66296501272242SNP_A-1780287	6.85174904141606SNP_A-1780289	7.53397857200235SNP_A-1780290	7.16992500144231SNP_A-1780292	6.83920378809694SNP_A-1780293	8.02236781302845SNP_A-1780294	7.42766203814391SNP_A-1780295	8.23999623980736SNP_A-1780299	8.65642486327778SNP_A-1780300	6.4648860487294SNP_A-1780301	6.48179943166575SNP_A-1780302	6.13955135239879!sample_table_end
