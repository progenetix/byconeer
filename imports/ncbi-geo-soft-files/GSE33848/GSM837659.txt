Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837659/suppl/GSM837659_SNP6.0_EA020.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.23242092717608SNP_A-1780271	7.18487534290828SNP_A-1780272	8.93172244858845SNP_A-1780274	8.85746269261045SNP_A-1780277	9.06608919045777SNP_A-1780278	6.86573327085176SNP_A-1780283	7.81057163474115SNP_A-1780285	8.6765448084809SNP_A-1780286	7.56732234158543SNP_A-1780287	8.30909734555287SNP_A-1780289	8.8811139606751SNP_A-1780290	8.7004397181411SNP_A-1780292	8.04894090862736SNP_A-1780293	9.21593739919915SNP_A-1780294	8.88671271367089SNP_A-1780295	9.41503749927884SNP_A-1780299	9.93908941799667SNP_A-1780300	7.75042785397277SNP_A-1780301	7.8856963733394SNP_A-1780302	7.64925617751731!sample_table_end
