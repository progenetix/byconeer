Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837695/suppl/GSM837695_SNP6.0_EA085.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.10000522442272SNP_A-1780271	7.72877084954266SNP_A-1780272	9.01262453886506SNP_A-1780274	9.10459875356437SNP_A-1780277	8.76652890859886SNP_A-1780278	7.24436383512051SNP_A-1780283	7.90689059560852SNP_A-1780285	8.82495874052852SNP_A-1780286	7.41362792902417SNP_A-1780287	8.52290841355846SNP_A-1780289	8.80896417491926SNP_A-1780290	8.46147944728616SNP_A-1780292	8.21431912080077SNP_A-1780293	9.74090507985426SNP_A-1780294	8.94006884440284SNP_A-1780295	9.54817971167945SNP_A-1780299	10.1399776177412SNP_A-1780300	7.63783240214696SNP_A-1780301	7.95782756083374SNP_A-1780302	8!sample_table_end
