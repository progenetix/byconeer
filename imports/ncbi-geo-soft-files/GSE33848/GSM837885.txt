Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837885/suppl/GSM837885_SNP6.0_WE122.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.45738087907254SNP_A-1780271	6.88417051910843SNP_A-1780272	7.96289600533726SNP_A-1780274	7.92679015304622SNP_A-1780277	8.01680828768655SNP_A-1780278	6.8703647195834SNP_A-1780283	7.12153351734003SNP_A-1780285	7.96193195916648SNP_A-1780286	6.68416417842826SNP_A-1780287	7.467605550083SNP_A-1780289	7.76044274599664SNP_A-1780290	7.66177809777199SNP_A-1780292	7.37213954084113SNP_A-1780293	8.63481105017172SNP_A-1780294	8.05256805080415SNP_A-1780295	8.64205169292798SNP_A-1780299	9.06653771993158SNP_A-1780300	6.82654848729092SNP_A-1780301	6.90689059560852SNP_A-1780302	6.81858217748086!sample_table_end
