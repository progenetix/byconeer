Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837882/suppl/GSM837882_SNP6.0_WE117.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.68299458368168SNP_A-1780271	6.88264304936184SNP_A-1780272	8.17658873172332SNP_A-1780274	8.19803570819926SNP_A-1780277	9.12153351734003SNP_A-1780278	6.94397991434374SNP_A-1780283	7.29691620687929SNP_A-1780285	7.84444424079282SNP_A-1780286	6.75933340719466SNP_A-1780287	7.48515844375567SNP_A-1780289	8.1623913287569SNP_A-1780290	7.94544383637791SNP_A-1780292	7.34281546136118SNP_A-1780293	8.04894090862736SNP_A-1780294	8.05799172275918SNP_A-1780295	8.80251636512122SNP_A-1780299	9.12627426707263SNP_A-1780300	6.90488545971814SNP_A-1780301	7.25029841790633SNP_A-1780302	6.62021982550749!sample_table_end
