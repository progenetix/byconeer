Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837690/suppl/GSM837690_SNP6.0_EA076.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.06137119265981SNP_A-1780271	7.47167521439204SNP_A-1780272	8.83815340942595SNP_A-1780274	9.08657856599073SNP_A-1780277	9.48415156105278SNP_A-1780278	7.42836017270429SNP_A-1780283	8.22941968823042SNP_A-1780285	8.35535109642481SNP_A-1780286	7.70965824817047SNP_A-1780287	8.60115173882049SNP_A-1780289	8.62874929738451SNP_A-1780290	8.32117649547422SNP_A-1780292	8.32867492732795SNP_A-1780293	9.36959734627868SNP_A-1780294	9.12066988664026SNP_A-1780295	9.48347991530467SNP_A-1780299	10.5560269927247SNP_A-1780300	7.97918698926457SNP_A-1780301	8.01332267342545SNP_A-1780302	6.88874324889826!sample_table_end
