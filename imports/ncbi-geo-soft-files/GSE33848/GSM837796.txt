Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837796/suppl/GSM837796_SNP6.0_WE012.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.05934446082443SNP_A-1780271	7.27728740013036SNP_A-1780272	7.98489310760979SNP_A-1780274	8.59494658929378SNP_A-1780277	8.56985560833095SNP_A-1780278	7.00842862207058SNP_A-1780283	7.8811139606751SNP_A-1780285	8.1931146288142SNP_A-1780286	7.06069593168755SNP_A-1780287	8.0759247695814SNP_A-1780289	8.28771237954945SNP_A-1780290	8.27224097078701SNP_A-1780292	7.96866679319521SNP_A-1780293	9.34170412862613SNP_A-1780294	8.66059020553453SNP_A-1780295	9.12670447284319SNP_A-1780299	9.52356195605701SNP_A-1780300	7.63420601974101SNP_A-1780301	7.36194377373524SNP_A-1780302	6.75488750216347!sample_table_end
