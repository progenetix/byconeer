Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837801/suppl/GSM837801_SNP6.0_WE017.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.67065624911844SNP_A-1780271	8.0042204663182SNP_A-1780272	8.96048468095694SNP_A-1780274	9.37901728709418SNP_A-1780277	10.2618990265655SNP_A-1780278	8.20701432017753SNP_A-1780283	8.53624721568813SNP_A-1780285	9.22279490286811SNP_A-1780286	7.6122541923889SNP_A-1780287	8.67006606909757SNP_A-1780289	9.10590850857116SNP_A-1780290	9.23082104340703SNP_A-1780292	8.9282716130849SNP_A-1780293	9.8006303128802SNP_A-1780294	9.25187685902756SNP_A-1780295	9.75042785397277SNP_A-1780299	10.6515002206527SNP_A-1780300	9.19803570819926SNP_A-1780301	8.25207404279618SNP_A-1780302	7.75405236752892!sample_table_end
