Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837843/suppl/GSM837843_SNP6.0_WE059.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.98156728190301SNP_A-1780271	7.23601419190009SNP_A-1780272	8.65761618873019SNP_A-1780274	8.8423503434138SNP_A-1780277	9.1955772667508SNP_A-1780278	7.54399845013454SNP_A-1780283	7.55554777164706SNP_A-1780285	8.40372218605101SNP_A-1780286	7.5104345220714SNP_A-1780287	7.9028775331019SNP_A-1780289	8.16741814583174SNP_A-1780290	8.11026579077459SNP_A-1780292	8.11634396123747SNP_A-1780293	8.96626510287713SNP_A-1780294	8.3037807481771SNP_A-1780295	9.41292262710795SNP_A-1780299	9.95951902158964SNP_A-1780300	7.87344411251538SNP_A-1780301	7.39339045744399SNP_A-1780302	7.16992500144231!sample_table_end
