Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837780/suppl/GSM837780_SNP6.0_EA153.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.98441845880114SNP_A-1780271	7.53915881110803SNP_A-1780272	8.22319727214722SNP_A-1780274	9.03204572693081SNP_A-1780277	9.60269886501796SNP_A-1780278	7.54785850605842SNP_A-1780283	7.96361861744397SNP_A-1780285	8.85798099512757SNP_A-1780286	7.09803208296053SNP_A-1780287	8.51241126826907SNP_A-1780289	8.27612440527424SNP_A-1780290	8.41292262710795SNP_A-1780292	8.3779335046161SNP_A-1780293	9.63238940454918SNP_A-1780294	9.10983065427879SNP_A-1780295	9.03846178914876SNP_A-1780299	9.81484945860453SNP_A-1780300	7.50382573799575SNP_A-1780301	7.83526091862749SNP_A-1780302	6.9188632372746!sample_table_end
