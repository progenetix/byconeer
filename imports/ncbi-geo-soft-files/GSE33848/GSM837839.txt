Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837839/suppl/GSM837839_SNP6.0_WE055.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.77889847600838SNP_A-1780271	7.35424938194524SNP_A-1780272	8.64985493039617SNP_A-1780274	8.09451759878429SNP_A-1780277	9.09099453222059SNP_A-1780278	7.21916852046216SNP_A-1780283	8.12153351734003SNP_A-1780285	8.47640869193866SNP_A-1780286	7.45121111183233SNP_A-1780287	8.09275714091985SNP_A-1780289	9.1102657907746SNP_A-1780290	8.40230151135138SNP_A-1780292	8.1093953865003SNP_A-1780293	9.05256805080415SNP_A-1780294	8.72223830841965SNP_A-1780295	9.49051664876686SNP_A-1780299	9.83683935974872SNP_A-1780300	7.41644569367165SNP_A-1780301	7.70563238736141SNP_A-1780302	7.35424938194524!sample_table_end
