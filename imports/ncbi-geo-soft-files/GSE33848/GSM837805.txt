Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837805/suppl/GSM837805_SNP6.0_WE021.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.3083390301394SNP_A-1780271	7.66711154207503SNP_A-1780272	8.69058005536557SNP_A-1780274	9.14932373137519SNP_A-1780277	9.86753615697163SNP_A-1780278	7.75321674917896SNP_A-1780283	8.49435560353285SNP_A-1780285	9.04348303941603SNP_A-1780286	7.7791721542869SNP_A-1780287	8.68883309849311SNP_A-1780289	8.63903917347695SNP_A-1780290	8.50250034052918SNP_A-1780292	8.49851682661069SNP_A-1780293	9.49851682661068SNP_A-1780294	8.94593148047277SNP_A-1780295	9.57175264350355SNP_A-1780299	10.1221809012598SNP_A-1780300	8.13271392234524SNP_A-1780301	7.88874324889826SNP_A-1780302	7.77643303244473!sample_table_end
