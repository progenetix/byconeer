Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837783/suppl/GSM837783_SNP6.0_EA156.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.79522796602868SNP_A-1780271	6.92184093707449SNP_A-1780272	8.36048133565676SNP_A-1780274	8.82866542830302SNP_A-1780277	9.30530177629995SNP_A-1780278	7.39231742277876SNP_A-1780283	7.69174351917127SNP_A-1780285	7.70965824817047SNP_A-1780286	7.07503339170882SNP_A-1780287	8.0759247695814SNP_A-1780289	7.58370961741107SNP_A-1780290	8.29155444584384SNP_A-1780292	7.78463484555752SNP_A-1780293	9.2045711442492SNP_A-1780294	8.90237511448603SNP_A-1780295	8.47235237706155SNP_A-1780299	9.91139198784346SNP_A-1780300	7.86418614465428SNP_A-1780301	7.44501484586842SNP_A-1780302	7.43149760425805!sample_table_end
