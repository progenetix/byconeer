Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837713/suppl/GSM837713_SNP6.0_EA121.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.90538700501813SNP_A-1780271	7.29462074889163SNP_A-1780272	8.59058704991503SNP_A-1780274	8.62327185761863SNP_A-1780277	8.53332973230583SNP_A-1780278	7.21916852046216SNP_A-1780283	7.75238064655289SNP_A-1780285	8.2823162389885SNP_A-1780286	6.57490883605723SNP_A-1780287	8.03708931873522SNP_A-1780289	8.70678378011278SNP_A-1780290	7.88772833852162SNP_A-1780292	8.07859560349612SNP_A-1780293	9.06159620943339SNP_A-1780294	8.83289001416474SNP_A-1780295	9.39803107397315SNP_A-1780299	9.45840661323653SNP_A-1780300	8.02144271197663SNP_A-1780301	7.71252700043982SNP_A-1780302	6.45327063401062!sample_table_end
