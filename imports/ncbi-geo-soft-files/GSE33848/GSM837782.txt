Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837782/suppl/GSM837782_SNP6.0_EA155.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.40247917221496SNP_A-1780271	8.06608919045777SNP_A-1780272	8.69464808033133SNP_A-1780274	9.40726776424473SNP_A-1780277	9.59991284218713SNP_A-1780278	7.85875809993542SNP_A-1780283	8.69522829149575SNP_A-1780285	8.65284497300198SNP_A-1780286	7.87753977187611SNP_A-1780287	8.54817971167944SNP_A-1780289	8.35461671359353SNP_A-1780290	8.21512848690384SNP_A-1780292	8.05075561960989SNP_A-1780293	9.15186219837771SNP_A-1780294	8.89532282021522SNP_A-1780295	9.3883761200792SNP_A-1780299	9.79279029430106SNP_A-1780300	8.23999623980736SNP_A-1780301	7.9592775057205SNP_A-1780302	7.90162115834611!sample_table_end
