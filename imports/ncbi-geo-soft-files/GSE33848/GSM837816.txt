Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837816/suppl/GSM837816_SNP6.0_WE032.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	6.98868468677217SNP_A-1780271	6.53138146051631SNP_A-1780272	7.74483383749955SNP_A-1780274	8.15734693536284SNP_A-1780277	8.34355587453673SNP_A-1780278	6.64565843240871SNP_A-1780283	7.05934446082443SNP_A-1780285	7.44983646185611SNP_A-1780286	6.48649986183547SNP_A-1780287	7.2447602343649SNP_A-1780289	7.26834705468252SNP_A-1780290	7.85798099512757SNP_A-1780292	7.08214904135387SNP_A-1780293	8.38442402062113SNP_A-1780294	7.78572490608606SNP_A-1780295	7.97537033349129SNP_A-1780299	8.87805091272854SNP_A-1780300	6.78354396078654SNP_A-1780301	6.80896417491926SNP_A-1780302	6.67771964164101!sample_table_end
