Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837818/suppl/GSM837818_SNP6.0_WE034.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.66711154207503SNP_A-1780271	7.55362929391636SNP_A-1780272	7.9188632372746SNP_A-1780274	8.35535109642481SNP_A-1780277	9.29958963326608SNP_A-1780278	7.27029532647204SNP_A-1780283	7.92555443987355SNP_A-1780285	8.49051664876686SNP_A-1780286	6.8988532765431SNP_A-1780287	8.0936376383783SNP_A-1780289	8.1632303488683SNP_A-1780290	7.95419631038687SNP_A-1780292	7.96000193206808SNP_A-1780293	8.64625867999003SNP_A-1780294	8.43393312040049SNP_A-1780295	9.47133651382918SNP_A-1780299	9.56890615450208SNP_A-1780300	7.395177076918SNP_A-1780301	7.69261550169458SNP_A-1780302	7.51963625284321!sample_table_end
