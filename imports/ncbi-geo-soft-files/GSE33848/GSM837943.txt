Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837943/suppl/GSM837943_SNP6.0_WE133.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.76652890859886SNP_A-1780271	7.34651373316564SNP_A-1780272	8.10765300097342SNP_A-1780274	8.8553876184794SNP_A-1780277	8.63117705570398SNP_A-1780278	7.29347164883813SNP_A-1780283	8.02513956227851SNP_A-1780285	8.1172101846444SNP_A-1780286	7.1480528209648SNP_A-1780287	7.76265886784698SNP_A-1780289	8.2644426002266SNP_A-1780290	7.89986039354099SNP_A-1780292	7.59867288075206SNP_A-1780293	8.85642552862553SNP_A-1780294	8.18652696877944SNP_A-1780295	8.71195370615813SNP_A-1780299	9.3279268355088SNP_A-1780300	7.3037807481771SNP_A-1780301	7.61194694181998SNP_A-1780302	7.90463462166815!sample_table_end
