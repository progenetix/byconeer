Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837681/suppl/GSM837681_SNP6.0_EA061.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.99929538702341SNP_A-1780271	7.25148241062021SNP_A-1780272	8.4858293087019SNP_A-1780274	8.54753722890735SNP_A-1780277	8.46420537165102SNP_A-1780278	6.9395792143147SNP_A-1780283	7.9851303734669SNP_A-1780285	8.34133349405995SNP_A-1780286	7.57364718749332SNP_A-1780287	8.57868717529467SNP_A-1780289	8.45121111183233SNP_A-1780290	8.75377388185276SNP_A-1780292	7.92580166719674SNP_A-1780293	9.40372218605101SNP_A-1780294	8.97632544444367SNP_A-1780295	9.0741414627525SNP_A-1780299	10.2070143201775SNP_A-1780300	7.62327185761863SNP_A-1780301	7.62388149001346SNP_A-1780302	7.56319627221674!sample_table_end
