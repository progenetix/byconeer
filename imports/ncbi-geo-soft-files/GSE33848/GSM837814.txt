Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837814/suppl/GSM837814_SNP6.0_WE030.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	6.70563238736141SNP_A-1780271	6.28771237954945SNP_A-1780272	7.07324898203064SNP_A-1780274	7.56096964509936SNP_A-1780277	7.78681414361677SNP_A-1780278	6.18735207320050SNP_A-1780283	6.8703647195834SNP_A-1780285	7.43462822763672SNP_A-1780286	6.1632303488683SNP_A-1780287	6.98868468677217SNP_A-1780289	7.34725225124723SNP_A-1780290	7.20130712692731SNP_A-1780292	6.97918698926458SNP_A-1780293	8.09890936790145SNP_A-1780294	7.5274770060604SNP_A-1780295	8.06788247228082SNP_A-1780299	8.44777202786556SNP_A-1780300	6.52356195605701SNP_A-1780301	6.83447104998422SNP_A-1780302	6.58871463558226!sample_table_end
