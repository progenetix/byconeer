Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837772/suppl/GSM837772_SNP6.0_EA138.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.63662462054365SNP_A-1780271	7.21553299974566SNP_A-1780272	7.73470962022584SNP_A-1780274	8.17492568250068SNP_A-1780277	8.7267858142838SNP_A-1780278	7.11504365016171SNP_A-1780283	7.40832974076739SNP_A-1780285	8.07859560349612SNP_A-1780286	6.65821148275179SNP_A-1780287	8.05889368905357SNP_A-1780289	7.9638594077376SNP_A-1780290	7.84549005094437SNP_A-1780292	7.83815340942594SNP_A-1780293	8.72735324596895SNP_A-1780294	8.60177078840771SNP_A-1780295	8.96289600533726SNP_A-1780299	9.6894156525252SNP_A-1780300	7.17990909001493SNP_A-1780301	7.46352437327118SNP_A-1780302	6.8073549220576!sample_table_end
