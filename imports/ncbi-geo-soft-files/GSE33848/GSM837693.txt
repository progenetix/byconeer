Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837693/suppl/GSM837693_SNP6.0_EA083.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.06541613467655SNP_A-1780271	7.62205181945638SNP_A-1780272	8.93810932621924SNP_A-1780274	8.33910768486419SNP_A-1780277	9.46420537165101SNP_A-1780278	7.35314682549808SNP_A-1780283	7.81538329581354SNP_A-1780285	9.04211533979624SNP_A-1780286	7.44294349584873SNP_A-1780287	8.53008114944056SNP_A-1780289	8.36486421003796SNP_A-1780290	8.64865717603854SNP_A-1780292	7.95419631038687SNP_A-1780293	9.70592032170842SNP_A-1780294	8.8281364841941SNP_A-1780295	9.60269886501796SNP_A-1780299	9.9941176831136SNP_A-1780300	7.45669665091606SNP_A-1780301	7.51668494930961SNP_A-1780302	7.63390340934852!sample_table_end
