Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837709/suppl/GSM837709_SNP6.0_EA114.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.75238064655289SNP_A-1780271	7.48079020109582SNP_A-1780272	9.2268135546055SNP_A-1780274	8.9648221672267SNP_A-1780277	9.44570463552578SNP_A-1780278	6.97727992349992SNP_A-1780283	7.73470962022584SNP_A-1780285	8.06788247228082SNP_A-1780286	6.66059020553453SNP_A-1780287	7.74595437739346SNP_A-1780289	8.1963972128035SNP_A-1780290	7.61470984411521SNP_A-1780292	7.59991284218713SNP_A-1780293	8.963377786955SNP_A-1780294	8.56096964509936SNP_A-1780295	9.20294005867027SNP_A-1780299	10.2209828510818SNP_A-1780300	6.88874324889826SNP_A-1780301	7.59712142878957SNP_A-1780302	6.94397991434374!sample_table_end
