Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837703/suppl/GSM837703_SNP6.0_EA097.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.98797452429615SNP_A-1780271	7.83683935974872SNP_A-1780272	8.57805813885964SNP_A-1780274	8.8418263938744SNP_A-1780277	9.33687843635333SNP_A-1780278	7.71424551766612SNP_A-1780283	8.1611318829843SNP_A-1780285	8.71080643369935SNP_A-1780286	7.23840473932508SNP_A-1780287	8.6226619675056SNP_A-1780289	8.29920801838728SNP_A-1780290	8.4898479604393SNP_A-1780292	8.01959072835788SNP_A-1780293	8.75433079945894SNP_A-1780294	9.1189410727235SNP_A-1780295	9.5368947448915SNP_A-1780299	10.0260622965862SNP_A-1780300	7.79007693062577SNP_A-1780301	7.95782756083374SNP_A-1780302	7.5372184005386!sample_table_end
