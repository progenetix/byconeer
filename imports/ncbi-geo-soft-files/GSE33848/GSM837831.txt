Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837831/suppl/GSM837831_SNP6.0_WE047.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.76818432477693SNP_A-1780271	8.04780555400759SNP_A-1780272	9.22841788620357SNP_A-1780274	9.37901728709418SNP_A-1780277	10.1429579538420SNP_A-1780278	8.2167458581953SNP_A-1780283	8.6640027628865SNP_A-1780285	9.01680828768655SNP_A-1780286	8.1890008677124SNP_A-1780287	8.84601267186691SNP_A-1780289	9.18115225686557SNP_A-1780290	9.17866485100647SNP_A-1780292	8.58621429693061SNP_A-1780293	9.80601250543438SNP_A-1780294	9.01773636429681SNP_A-1780295	9.58621429693062SNP_A-1780299	10.5044879803948SNP_A-1780300	8.24555270625568SNP_A-1780301	8.08081752760833SNP_A-1780302	7.85953478638265!sample_table_end
