Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837653/suppl/GSM837653_SNP6.0_EA012.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.50084187955693SNP_A-1780271	7.44190670454224SNP_A-1780272	9.48951350001334SNP_A-1780274	8.73414507510383SNP_A-1780277	9.92208880152676SNP_A-1780278	7.283088353024SNP_A-1780283	8.14465824283188SNP_A-1780285	8.94982671075911SNP_A-1780286	7.77478705960117SNP_A-1780287	8.63602035036062SNP_A-1780289	9.38370429247405SNP_A-1780290	9.23681148124941SNP_A-1780292	8.89330153086056SNP_A-1780293	9.52845411076479SNP_A-1780294	9.14423335841094SNP_A-1780295	9.88315238565694SNP_A-1780299	10.5488219084588SNP_A-1780300	8.60115173882049SNP_A-1780301	7.98726401207254SNP_A-1780302	7.93810932621924!sample_table_end
