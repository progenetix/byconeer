Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837722/suppl/GSM837722_SNP6.0_EA137.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.83209884603913SNP_A-1780271	7.69696752623429SNP_A-1780272	8.9507988772655SNP_A-1780274	9.1682542484578SNP_A-1780277	9.28694273693803SNP_A-1780278	7.7515440590891SNP_A-1780283	8.46199095058557SNP_A-1780285	8.95128471496697SNP_A-1780286	7.31136990318878SNP_A-1780287	8.68650052718322SNP_A-1780289	8.74651432113846SNP_A-1780290	8.71252700043982SNP_A-1780292	8.57805813885964SNP_A-1780293	9.80708653864303SNP_A-1780294	9.25738784269265SNP_A-1780295	9.57175264350355SNP_A-1780299	10.5985178106126SNP_A-1780300	7.83710226545166SNP_A-1780301	9.06911406177394SNP_A-1780302	7.85174904141606!sample_table_end
