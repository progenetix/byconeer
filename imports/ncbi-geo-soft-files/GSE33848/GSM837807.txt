Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837807/suppl/GSM837807_SNP6.0_WE023.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.17492568250068SNP_A-1780271	7.59339112279174SNP_A-1780272	8.48247186003537SNP_A-1780274	8.8856963733394SNP_A-1780277	9.57175264350355SNP_A-1780278	7.5401280385821SNP_A-1780283	8.02236781302845SNP_A-1780285	8.98868468677217SNP_A-1780286	7.21431912080077SNP_A-1780287	8.4318457869654SNP_A-1780289	8.56033283421244SNP_A-1780290	8.6275338844728SNP_A-1780292	8.44156094179861SNP_A-1780293	9.12066988664026SNP_A-1780294	8.89330153086056SNP_A-1780295	9.57742882803575SNP_A-1780299	9.49751922714195SNP_A-1780300	8.12756449971867SNP_A-1780301	7.94178124227853SNP_A-1780302	7.52649923913657!sample_table_end
