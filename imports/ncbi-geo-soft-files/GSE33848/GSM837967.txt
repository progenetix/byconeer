Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837967/suppl/GSM837967_SNP6.0_WE161.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	6.68650052718322SNP_A-1780271	6.09539702279256SNP_A-1780272	7.11547721741994SNP_A-1780274	7.54560806208427SNP_A-1780277	7.4262647547021SNP_A-1780278	6.14210705730255SNP_A-1780283	6.69174351917127SNP_A-1780285	7.24158598656976SNP_A-1780286	5.82442843541655SNP_A-1780287	7.04074634234331SNP_A-1780289	7.30682120249715SNP_A-1780290	6.82017896241519SNP_A-1780292	6.80305478462398SNP_A-1780293	7.84339767198314SNP_A-1780294	7.1480528209648SNP_A-1780295	7.92580166719674SNP_A-1780299	8.63602035036062SNP_A-1780300	6.09099453222059SNP_A-1780301	6.34429590791582SNP_A-1780302	5.93957921431469!sample_table_end
