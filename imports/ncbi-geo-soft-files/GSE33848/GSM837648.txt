Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837648/suppl/GSM837648_SNP6.0_EA007.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.66977088852552SNP_A-1780271	6.85330955540367SNP_A-1780272	8.34651373316563SNP_A-1780274	8.10678101845012SNP_A-1780277	8.95371145236151SNP_A-1780278	6.56224242422107SNP_A-1780283	8.50283180406674SNP_A-1780285	8.03525732478633SNP_A-1780286	6.95031287589965SNP_A-1780287	7.69464808033133SNP_A-1780289	8.31363888668278SNP_A-1780290	7.87958324961278SNP_A-1780292	7.91288933622996SNP_A-1780293	7.72337652941825SNP_A-1780294	8.3279268355088SNP_A-1780295	9.64955558501883SNP_A-1780299	9.36850646150769SNP_A-1780300	7.35314682549808SNP_A-1780301	7.01262453886506SNP_A-1780302	6.64925617751731!sample_table_end
