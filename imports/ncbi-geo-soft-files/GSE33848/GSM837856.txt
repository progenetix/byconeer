Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837856/suppl/GSM837856_SNP6.0_WE072.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.32530545508968SNP_A-1780271	6.46964181723952SNP_A-1780272	8.01495034146597SNP_A-1780274	8.71710517180536SNP_A-1780277	8.58182824999703SNP_A-1780278	6.4655664048094SNP_A-1780283	7.19967234483636SNP_A-1780285	7.53397857200235SNP_A-1780286	6.75711216727799SNP_A-1780287	7.5104345220714SNP_A-1780289	7.93270688741265SNP_A-1780290	7.55330929945106SNP_A-1780292	7.0389189892923SNP_A-1780293	8.53915881110803SNP_A-1780294	8.05708919220682SNP_A-1780295	8.19475685442225SNP_A-1780299	8.87344411251538SNP_A-1780300	6.65344223860393SNP_A-1780301	6.90538700501813SNP_A-1780302	6.59432460392485!sample_table_end
