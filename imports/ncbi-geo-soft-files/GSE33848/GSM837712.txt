Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837712/suppl/GSM837712_SNP6.0_EA119.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.24733417802873SNP_A-1780271	7.868822554775SNP_A-1780272	8.82866542830302SNP_A-1780274	8.92728414210802SNP_A-1780277	9.57900159069112SNP_A-1780278	7.32755264408124SNP_A-1780283	7.96072599483906SNP_A-1780285	8.47640869193866SNP_A-1780286	7.09803208296053SNP_A-1780287	8.27999741442144SNP_A-1780289	9.02560100320389SNP_A-1780290	8.44914864537544SNP_A-1780292	8.22801697053032SNP_A-1780293	9.2950035789432SNP_A-1780294	8.71310006699786SNP_A-1780295	9.47607110095996SNP_A-1780299	10.1021944434178SNP_A-1780300	7.64144969206763SNP_A-1780301	7.81057163474115SNP_A-1780302	7.09275714091985!sample_table_end
