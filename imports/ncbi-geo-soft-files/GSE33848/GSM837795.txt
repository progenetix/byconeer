Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837795/suppl/GSM837795_SNP6.0_WE011.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.28771237954945SNP_A-1780271	6.53332973230583SNP_A-1780272	7.93761903053368SNP_A-1780274	7.75042785397277SNP_A-1780277	8.19967234483636SNP_A-1780278	6.4898479604393SNP_A-1780283	7.44190670454224SNP_A-1780285	7.70850914811698SNP_A-1780286	6.40655934535454SNP_A-1780287	7.58996318177952SNP_A-1780289	7.6923248994092SNP_A-1780290	7.4797802640291SNP_A-1780292	6.52094600785SNP_A-1780293	8.35241131947099SNP_A-1780294	8.04530462430561SNP_A-1780295	8.49385544924082SNP_A-1780299	8.76099709568295SNP_A-1780300	6.57994442595453SNP_A-1780301	6.73301532168596SNP_A-1780302	6.21431912080077!sample_table_end
