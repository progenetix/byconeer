Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837666/suppl/GSM837666_SNP6.0_EA030.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.08480838780436SNP_A-1780271	7.1873520732005SNP_A-1780272	8.64625867999003SNP_A-1780274	8.84130225398094SNP_A-1780277	9.52649923913657SNP_A-1780278	7.15101653889225SNP_A-1780283	8.09671515448854SNP_A-1780285	8.37068740680722SNP_A-1780286	7.45532722030456SNP_A-1780287	8.3779335046161SNP_A-1780289	8.7102324551595SNP_A-1780290	8.57364718749332SNP_A-1780292	8.06249592573376SNP_A-1780293	9.41327532116689SNP_A-1780294	9.17284417147607SNP_A-1780295	9.07770587479638SNP_A-1780299	9.83209884603913SNP_A-1780300	7.97537033349129SNP_A-1780301	7.73978060977326SNP_A-1780302	7.8008998999203!sample_table_end
