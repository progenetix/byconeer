Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837887/suppl/GSM837887_SNP6.0_WE124.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	6.82017896241519SNP_A-1780271	6.74651432113846SNP_A-1780272	7.2045711442492SNP_A-1780274	8.20701432017753SNP_A-1780277	7.68182403997374SNP_A-1780278	6.3987436919382SNP_A-1780283	7.1959872980285SNP_A-1780285	7.56096964509936SNP_A-1780286	6.50514991894313SNP_A-1780287	7.44432472624709SNP_A-1780289	7.62449086490779SNP_A-1780290	7.24950854926307SNP_A-1780292	7.15143943059714SNP_A-1780293	8.15228484230658SNP_A-1780294	7.78245225052567SNP_A-1780295	8.78026634853039SNP_A-1780299	9.00562454919388SNP_A-1780300	6.26052755022322SNP_A-1780301	7.00140819439281SNP_A-1780302	6.46352437327118!sample_table_end
