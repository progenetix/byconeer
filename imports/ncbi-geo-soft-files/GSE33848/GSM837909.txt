Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837909/suppl/GSM837909_SNP6.0_WE129.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.34983409145725SNP_A-1780271	6.51372759595244SNP_A-1780272	7.77588458345851SNP_A-1780274	8.03800444406935SNP_A-1780277	8.55074678538324SNP_A-1780278	6.62753388447279SNP_A-1780283	6.51175265376738SNP_A-1780285	7.49851682661068SNP_A-1780286	6.395177076918SNP_A-1780287	7.76265886784698SNP_A-1780289	8.32717835557457SNP_A-1780290	7.8008998999203SNP_A-1780292	7.4093909361377SNP_A-1780293	8.45121111183233SNP_A-1780294	7.85486838326024SNP_A-1780295	9.98726401207254SNP_A-1780299	9.17907971658543SNP_A-1780300	6.31891934501502SNP_A-1780301	6.79279029430106SNP_A-1780302	6.4998458870832!sample_table_end
