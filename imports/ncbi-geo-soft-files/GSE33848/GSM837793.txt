Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837793/suppl/GSM837793_SNP6.0_WE009.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.38046106508897SNP_A-1780271	6.90689059560852SNP_A-1780272	8.04165915163721SNP_A-1780274	8.14805282096481SNP_A-1780277	8.59743185268337SNP_A-1780278	6.62205181945638SNP_A-1780283	7.4542992936199SNP_A-1780285	8.03525732478633SNP_A-1780286	6.7944158663501SNP_A-1780287	7.52486815355764SNP_A-1780289	8.01866384426503SNP_A-1780290	7.56732234158543SNP_A-1780292	7.4797802640291SNP_A-1780293	8.56224242422107SNP_A-1780294	8.28540221886225SNP_A-1780295	8.6923248994092SNP_A-1780299	9.51405649029807SNP_A-1780300	6.67478076296963SNP_A-1780301	7.16867211813223SNP_A-1780302	6.76487159073609!sample_table_end
