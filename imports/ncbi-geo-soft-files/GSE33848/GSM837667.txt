Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837667/suppl/GSM837667_SNP6.0_EA032.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.54254826233521SNP_A-1780271	7.45738087907254SNP_A-1780272	9.34022101871305SNP_A-1780274	8.65940133439935SNP_A-1780277	9.94714987007384SNP_A-1780278	7.59525748144904SNP_A-1780283	8.0389189892923SNP_A-1780285	8.76099709568295SNP_A-1780286	7.71653369426139SNP_A-1780287	8.41644569367165SNP_A-1780289	8.59929299468419SNP_A-1780290	9.0817053399692SNP_A-1780292	7.97823377149558SNP_A-1780293	9.61256137753663SNP_A-1780294	8.98394365378093SNP_A-1780295	9.23760833022901SNP_A-1780299	9.8636700670094SNP_A-1780300	8.09715426422892SNP_A-1780301	7.73555602391153SNP_A-1780302	7.65642486327778!sample_table_end
