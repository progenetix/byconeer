Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837881/suppl/GSM837881_SNP6.0_WE116.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.46352437327118SNP_A-1780271	7.28886607416582SNP_A-1780272	8.6558288314408SNP_A-1780274	8.9371285681659SNP_A-1780277	9.86676376735335SNP_A-1780278	7.70822173003835SNP_A-1780283	8.13057056280543SNP_A-1780285	7.95419631038687SNP_A-1780286	7.2447602343649SNP_A-1780287	8.1463565303039SNP_A-1780289	8.48314397513762SNP_A-1780290	8.3083390301394SNP_A-1780292	7.93369065495223SNP_A-1780293	9.3955341354623SNP_A-1780294	8.71824744822362SNP_A-1780295	9.22037832769523SNP_A-1780299	9.99859042974533SNP_A-1780300	8.2126990251326SNP_A-1780301	7.39339045744399SNP_A-1780302	7.27262978497637!sample_table_end
