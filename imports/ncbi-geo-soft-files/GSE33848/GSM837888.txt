Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837888/suppl/GSM837888_SNP6.0_WE125.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.6733090755617SNP_A-1780271	6.9957671508778SNP_A-1780272	7.93270688741265SNP_A-1780274	8.71539005960706SNP_A-1780277	8.49318830701349SNP_A-1780278	6.90689059560852SNP_A-1780283	7.37829485591189SNP_A-1780285	8.07770587479639SNP_A-1780286	6.99246632731459SNP_A-1780287	8.06339508128851SNP_A-1780289	8.237608330229SNP_A-1780290	7.82654848729092SNP_A-1780292	8.06608919045777SNP_A-1780293	8.68591679460763SNP_A-1780294	9.59867288075206SNP_A-1780295	8.53462712001996SNP_A-1780299	9.7695623887282SNP_A-1780300	6.93467375212205SNP_A-1780301	7.36959734627868SNP_A-1780302	6.90388184573618!sample_table_end
