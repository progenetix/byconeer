Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837708/suppl/GSM837708_SNP6.0_EA111.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.37068740680722SNP_A-1780271	7.81378119121704SNP_A-1780272	9.2850168321788SNP_A-1780274	9.13357037534807SNP_A-1780277	9.87164859885376SNP_A-1780278	7.45738087907254SNP_A-1780283	8.44294349584873SNP_A-1780285	8.69580826940945SNP_A-1780286	7.25738784269265SNP_A-1780287	8.31061278165953SNP_A-1780289	8.70965824817047SNP_A-1780290	8.25738784269265SNP_A-1780292	8.15987133677839SNP_A-1780293	9.11374216604919SNP_A-1780294	8.92975155341733SNP_A-1780295	9.5542690699982SNP_A-1780299	10.5769566647061SNP_A-1780300	7.57112057556753SNP_A-1780301	8.18301500088276SNP_A-1780302	7.59898297103609!sample_table_end
