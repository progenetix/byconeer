Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837700/suppl/GSM837700_SNP6.0_EA094.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.89178370321831SNP_A-1780271	7.73131903102506SNP_A-1780272	9.17450962048168SNP_A-1780274	9.23042079509238SNP_A-1780277	10.1335703753481SNP_A-1780278	7.58590144969077SNP_A-1780283	8.34928122881745SNP_A-1780285	9.19721669311005SNP_A-1780286	7.86005234514727SNP_A-1780287	8.86056971830715SNP_A-1780289	9.03617361255349SNP_A-1780290	8.97918698926458SNP_A-1780292	8.83130724380205SNP_A-1780293	9.72052929138953SNP_A-1780294	9.27068466530611SNP_A-1780295	9.81991295429405SNP_A-1780299	10.4231159101471SNP_A-1780300	8.39660478118186SNP_A-1780301	8.16427843830117SNP_A-1780302	7.49585502688717!sample_table_end
