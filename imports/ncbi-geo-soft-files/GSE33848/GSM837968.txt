Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837968/suppl/GSM837968_SNP6.0_WE163.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	6.59245703726808SNP_A-1780271	6SNP_A-1780272	7.03158634305783SNP_A-1780274	7.27146302790437SNP_A-1780277	7.92679015304622SNP_A-1780278	6.32867492732795SNP_A-1780283	6.40514146313634SNP_A-1780285	7.12928301694497SNP_A-1780286	5.88671271367089SNP_A-1780287	6.75265940127135SNP_A-1780289	6.8073549220576SNP_A-1780290	6.56985560833095SNP_A-1780292	6.50514991894313SNP_A-1780293	7.7267858142838SNP_A-1780294	7.11894107272351SNP_A-1780295	7.4594316186373SNP_A-1780299	7.94934038173348SNP_A-1780300	6.12239663135973SNP_A-1780301	6.10590850857116SNP_A-1780302	6.04439411935845!sample_table_end
