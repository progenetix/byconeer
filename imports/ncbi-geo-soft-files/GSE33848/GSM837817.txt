Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837817/suppl/GSM837817_SNP6.0_WE033.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.76652890859886SNP_A-1780271	7.51668494930961SNP_A-1780272	8.37937836707126SNP_A-1780274	8.93467375212206SNP_A-1780277	8.41644569367165SNP_A-1780278	7.31174831500496SNP_A-1780283	7.967226258836SNP_A-1780285	8.3037807481771SNP_A-1780286	7.17990909001493SNP_A-1780287	8.1041619041921SNP_A-1780289	8.1395513523988SNP_A-1780290	8.01122725542325SNP_A-1780292	8.00562454919388SNP_A-1780293	9.5727002264873SNP_A-1780294	8.7284874402419SNP_A-1780295	9.02928722696825SNP_A-1780299	10.3782948559119SNP_A-1780300	7.27922364393312SNP_A-1780301	7.48079020109582SNP_A-1780302	7.03754695396218!sample_table_end
