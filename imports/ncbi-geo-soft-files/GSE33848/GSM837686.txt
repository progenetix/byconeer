Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837686/suppl/GSM837686_SNP6.0_EA067.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.53867395308267SNP_A-1780271	7.91960823860325SNP_A-1780272	9.03525732478633SNP_A-1780274	9.15860968821448SNP_A-1780277	10.0216740428584SNP_A-1780278	7.49285462017475SNP_A-1780283	8.4444972871038SNP_A-1780285	9.0329640560776SNP_A-1780286	7.63178335747415SNP_A-1780287	8.85798099512757SNP_A-1780289	9.21957190227407SNP_A-1780290	9.02097993890421SNP_A-1780292	8.67478076296963SNP_A-1780293	9.6183855022586SNP_A-1780294	9.38694024532431SNP_A-1780295	10.0165761752187SNP_A-1780299	10.849535419817SNP_A-1780300	8.21026546530752SNP_A-1780301	8.2246046815385SNP_A-1780302	7.94031359714597!sample_table_end
