Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837697/suppl/GSM837697_SNP6.0_EA089.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.44397954260125SNP_A-1780271	7.59432460392485SNP_A-1780272	8.25029841790633SNP_A-1780274	9.1006623390052SNP_A-1780277	9.92134508037915SNP_A-1780278	7.37937836707126SNP_A-1780283	7.80251636512122SNP_A-1780285	8.71080643369935SNP_A-1780286	7.35314682549808SNP_A-1780287	8.90939310281169SNP_A-1780289	8.78953364497036SNP_A-1780290	8.36923380966572SNP_A-1780292	8.48649986183547SNP_A-1780293	9.44328892744164SNP_A-1780294	9.40514146313634SNP_A-1780295	9.12066988664026SNP_A-1780299	10.1655351413779SNP_A-1780300	7.90388184573618SNP_A-1780301	7.98085360637974SNP_A-1780302	7.99223026496589!sample_table_end
