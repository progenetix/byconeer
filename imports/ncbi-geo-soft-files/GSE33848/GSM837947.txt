Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837947/suppl/GSM837947_SNP6.0_WE138.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	6.4178525148859SNP_A-1780271	6.27379559921426SNP_A-1780272	6.73921804589758SNP_A-1780274	7.6134825407312SNP_A-1780277	8.2745722856615SNP_A-1780278	6.2167458581953SNP_A-1780283	6.68825030913318SNP_A-1780285	6.77698127301409SNP_A-1780286	5.96193195916648SNP_A-1780287	6.98299357469431SNP_A-1780289	7.18652696877945SNP_A-1780290	6.62205181945638SNP_A-1780292	6.57742882803575SNP_A-1780293	7.53268060066794SNP_A-1780294	7.25266543245025SNP_A-1780295	7.90086680798075SNP_A-1780299	8.14550763646307SNP_A-1780300	6.35755200461808SNP_A-1780301	6.30606168942834SNP_A-1780302	6.11374216604919!sample_table_end
