Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837675/suppl/GSM837675_SNP6.0_EA048.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.14911199070689SNP_A-1780271	7.14974711950468SNP_A-1780272	8.80520645547903SNP_A-1780274	8.44294349584873SNP_A-1780277	9.68299458368168SNP_A-1780278	7.08214904135387SNP_A-1780283	7.78790255939143SNP_A-1780285	8.64685867793625SNP_A-1780286	7.37213954084113SNP_A-1780287	8.01866384426503SNP_A-1780289	8.38370429247405SNP_A-1780290	8.55202861135907SNP_A-1780292	8.03617361255349SNP_A-1780293	9.17534162456523SNP_A-1780294	8.83289001416474SNP_A-1780295	8.59370235028531SNP_A-1780299	9.44604940671655SNP_A-1780300	7.52486815355764SNP_A-1780301	7.46352437327118SNP_A-1780302	7.14974711950468!sample_table_end
