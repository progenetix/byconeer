Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837803/suppl/GSM837803_SNP6.0_WE019.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.87958324961278SNP_A-1780271	6.73131903102506SNP_A-1780272	8.28771237954945SNP_A-1780274	8.43809874901418SNP_A-1780277	8.620830748676SNP_A-1780278	7.46147944728616SNP_A-1780283	7.61930295541569SNP_A-1780285	8.67713234464902SNP_A-1780286	7.09275714091985SNP_A-1780287	7.9867901427824SNP_A-1780289	8.45395648857115SNP_A-1780290	8.47438196010327SNP_A-1780292	8.05256805080415SNP_A-1780293	8.7714894695006SNP_A-1780294	8.80950019388916SNP_A-1780295	9.12971232658685SNP_A-1780299	9.98560478815084SNP_A-1780300	7.4662464401936SNP_A-1780301	7.69435788722145SNP_A-1780302	7.05528243550119!sample_table_end
