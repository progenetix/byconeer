Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837651/suppl/GSM837651_SNP6.0_EA010.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.79197682089869SNP_A-1780271	6.7944158663501SNP_A-1780272	8.29615145995394SNP_A-1780274	8.0759247695814SNP_A-1780277	9.3155269841135SNP_A-1780278	6.89178370321831SNP_A-1780283	7.45327063401062SNP_A-1780285	8.34577483684173SNP_A-1780286	6.88467931651836SNP_A-1780287	8.47302922203802SNP_A-1780289	8.20701432017753SNP_A-1780290	8.28694273693803SNP_A-1780292	7.67006606909758SNP_A-1780293	8.9614496943982SNP_A-1780294	8.75766779795725SNP_A-1780295	9.25738784269265SNP_A-1780299	9.49851682661068SNP_A-1780300	7.69580826940944SNP_A-1780301	7.30263892378755SNP_A-1780302	7.4908508767403!sample_table_end
