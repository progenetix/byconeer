Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837889/suppl/GSM837889_SNP6.0_WE126.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.70649601806119SNP_A-1780271	7.35865120089289SNP_A-1780272	8.40514146313634SNP_A-1780274	8.97680276290655SNP_A-1780277	9.76155123244448SNP_A-1780278	7.43671154213721SNP_A-1780283	8.01820017881323SNP_A-1780285	8.2558154228739SNP_A-1780286	7.32042450429697SNP_A-1780287	8.20538599603076SNP_A-1780289	7.97823377149558SNP_A-1780290	8.02329232125675SNP_A-1780292	8.07235594886013SNP_A-1780293	8.85798099512757SNP_A-1780294	8.42136357780378SNP_A-1780295	9.51306958223937SNP_A-1780299	9.4189067312579SNP_A-1780300	7.72451385311995SNP_A-1780301	7.65015421367509SNP_A-1780302	7.36303963025651!sample_table_end
