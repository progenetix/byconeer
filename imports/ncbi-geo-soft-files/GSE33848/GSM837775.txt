Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837775/suppl/GSM837775_SNP6.0_EA141.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.29347164883813SNP_A-1780271	7.13057056280543SNP_A-1780272	8.04165915163721SNP_A-1780274	8.14465824283188SNP_A-1780277	8.66592803500219SNP_A-1780278	6.91587937883577SNP_A-1780283	7.19721669311005SNP_A-1780285	7.92283213947754SNP_A-1780286	6.5077946401987SNP_A-1780287	7.84130225398094SNP_A-1780289	8.09890936790145SNP_A-1780290	7.43879185257826SNP_A-1780292	7.7369655941662SNP_A-1780293	8.87702844986442SNP_A-1780294	8.37937836707126SNP_A-1780295	8.81484945860453SNP_A-1780299	9.40087943628218SNP_A-1780300	7.07681559705083SNP_A-1780301	7.17242750864548SNP_A-1780302	6.47370574961942!sample_table_end
