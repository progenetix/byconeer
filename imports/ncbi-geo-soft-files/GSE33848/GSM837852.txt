Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837852/suppl/GSM837852_SNP6.0_WE068.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.66444728454797SNP_A-1780271	7.81538329581354SNP_A-1780272	9.25542204999051SNP_A-1780274	9.20823435833979SNP_A-1780277	10.1204538981615SNP_A-1780278	7.43671154213721SNP_A-1780283	8.51026967089818SNP_A-1780285	8.88772833852163SNP_A-1780286	8.12239663135973SNP_A-1780287	8.83605035505807SNP_A-1780289	9.0037521348611SNP_A-1780290	9.319672120947SNP_A-1780292	8.38082178394093SNP_A-1780293	9.32080054888164SNP_A-1780294	9.39016895620018SNP_A-1780295	9.6308738092413SNP_A-1780299	10.7463743555753SNP_A-1780300	7.86624861111117SNP_A-1780301	8.23481743111732SNP_A-1780302	8.0285967770671!sample_table_end
