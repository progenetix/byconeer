Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837660/suppl/GSM837660_SNP6.0_EA021.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.55842071326866SNP_A-1780271	7.45121111183233SNP_A-1780272	8.79495731692538SNP_A-1780274	8.876516946565SNP_A-1780277	9.91288933622996SNP_A-1780278	7.3037807481771SNP_A-1780283	8.13635034145416SNP_A-1780285	9.01122725542325SNP_A-1780286	7.96866679319521SNP_A-1780287	8.70563238736142SNP_A-1780289	8.73414507510383SNP_A-1780290	8.92134508037915SNP_A-1780292	8.2447602343649SNP_A-1780293	9.64955558501883SNP_A-1780294	9.13014150851501SNP_A-1780295	9.50349450276507SNP_A-1780299	10.4152135987653SNP_A-1780300	8.18404882037586SNP_A-1780301	7.70303838898642SNP_A-1780302	7.57742882803575!sample_table_end
