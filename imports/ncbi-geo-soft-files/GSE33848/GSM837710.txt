Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837710/suppl/GSM837710_SNP6.0_EA115.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.55314927559855SNP_A-1780271	7.82575383288311SNP_A-1780272	9.3955341354623SNP_A-1780274	9.06474276475026SNP_A-1780277	10.4005236983835SNP_A-1780278	7.53624721568813SNP_A-1780283	8.60408986146918SNP_A-1780285	8.56224242422107SNP_A-1780286	7.4318457869654SNP_A-1780287	8.47640869193866SNP_A-1780289	8.76873570832688SNP_A-1780290	8.21350930038046SNP_A-1780292	8.16741814583174SNP_A-1780293	9.46113834430765SNP_A-1780294	8.69290604545568SNP_A-1780295	9.3159043072596SNP_A-1780299	10.0354864512922SNP_A-1780300	7.45395648857114SNP_A-1780301	8.00562454919388SNP_A-1780302	7.40620500541885!sample_table_end
