Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837847/suppl/GSM837847_SNP6.0_WE063.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.91774501344322SNP_A-1780271	8.1611318829843SNP_A-1780272	9.00982861736811SNP_A-1780274	9.43010403250913SNP_A-1780277	10.0687782779854SNP_A-1780278	7.80815977286837SNP_A-1780283	8.56367295982751SNP_A-1780285	9.02236781302845SNP_A-1780286	7.82442843541655SNP_A-1780287	8.95903594941339SNP_A-1780289	8.85434896109769SNP_A-1780290	9.11374216604919SNP_A-1780292	9.11417612455476SNP_A-1780293	9.6147098441152SNP_A-1780294	8.9638594077376SNP_A-1780295	9.83157115947843SNP_A-1780299	10.2082343583398SNP_A-1780300	8.57616938226315SNP_A-1780301	8.00842862207058SNP_A-1780302	7.74986942739684!sample_table_end
