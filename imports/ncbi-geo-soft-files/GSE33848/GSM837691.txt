Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837691/suppl/GSM837691_SNP6.0_EA077.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.95782756083374SNP_A-1780271	8.19290921911201SNP_A-1780272	9.27146302790437SNP_A-1780274	9.39160162269417SNP_A-1780277	9.85330955540367SNP_A-1780278	7.69609817095586SNP_A-1780283	8.55506839133334SNP_A-1780285	8.9282716130849SNP_A-1780286	8.41644569367165SNP_A-1780287	8.66533591718518SNP_A-1780289	8.99670885785699SNP_A-1780290	9.01448548080756SNP_A-1780292	8.5571445565814SNP_A-1780293	9.81244474365422SNP_A-1780294	9.2240016741981SNP_A-1780295	9.5186531556734SNP_A-1780299	10.4774209911552SNP_A-1780300	8.37068740680722SNP_A-1780301	8.0539258815311SNP_A-1780302	8.70260560211025!sample_table_end
