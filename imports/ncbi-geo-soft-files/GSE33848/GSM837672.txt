Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837672/suppl/GSM837672_SNP6.0_EA042.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.12992693351039SNP_A-1780271	7.67948009950545SNP_A-1780272	8.92233662340161SNP_A-1780274	9.00609227331563SNP_A-1780277	9.75683427167067SNP_A-1780278	6.87344411251538SNP_A-1780283	8.1006623390052SNP_A-1780285	8.87600526184927SNP_A-1780286	7.33091687811462SNP_A-1780287	8.29844448566721SNP_A-1780289	8.72735324596895SNP_A-1780290	8.38298420509155SNP_A-1780292	8.53397857200235SNP_A-1780293	9.51306958223937SNP_A-1780294	9.00749453654693SNP_A-1780295	9.62235692573665SNP_A-1780299	10.3243680922857SNP_A-1780300	7.60238957247934SNP_A-1780301	7.85408917987057SNP_A-1780302	7.28655776160796!sample_table_end
