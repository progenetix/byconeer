Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837841/suppl/GSM837841_SNP6.0_WE057.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.40194612397654SNP_A-1780271	7.40407713624123SNP_A-1780272	8.98631611779344SNP_A-1780274	8.96193195916648SNP_A-1780277	9.75766779795725SNP_A-1780278	7.32530545508968SNP_A-1780283	8.11178773580101SNP_A-1780285	8.81858217748086SNP_A-1780286	7.69812585230285SNP_A-1780287	8.12928301694497SNP_A-1780289	8.87139191438713SNP_A-1780290	8.87805091272854SNP_A-1780292	8.31061278165953SNP_A-1780293	9.34503556188787SNP_A-1780294	8.73188468288132SNP_A-1780295	9.12110176661381SNP_A-1780299	10.4276620381439SNP_A-1780300	7.7998212493722SNP_A-1780301	7.80976812871041SNP_A-1780302	7.37068740680722!sample_table_end
