Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837776/suppl/GSM837776_SNP6.0_EA143.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.06743436075652SNP_A-1780271	6.97154355395077SNP_A-1780272	7.31741261376487SNP_A-1780274	8.30454146269032SNP_A-1780277	8.64325494157228SNP_A-1780278	6.57364718749332SNP_A-1780283	7.2131042196419SNP_A-1780285	7.97727992349992SNP_A-1780286	6.35755200461808SNP_A-1780287	7.88467931651836SNP_A-1780289	7.75711216727798SNP_A-1780290	7.24634474308089SNP_A-1780292	7.45395648857114SNP_A-1780293	8.42905796959378SNP_A-1780294	8.29615145995394SNP_A-1780295	8.88060390408824SNP_A-1780299	9.01169316695351SNP_A-1780300	6.4093909361377SNP_A-1780301	7.01262453886506SNP_A-1780302	6.83920378809694!sample_table_end
