Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837860/suppl/GSM837860_SNP6.0_WE079.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	6.74651432113846SNP_A-1780271	6.64565843240871SNP_A-1780272	8.04439411935845SNP_A-1780274	7.9867901427824SNP_A-1780277	8.395177076918SNP_A-1780278	6.23840473932508SNP_A-1780283	7.28424574982967SNP_A-1780285	7.73809225962049SNP_A-1780286	6.12928301694497SNP_A-1780287	7.2336196767597SNP_A-1780289	7.55969574211073SNP_A-1780290	7.26052755022322SNP_A-1780292	6.97345821254751SNP_A-1780293	8.35974956032233SNP_A-1780294	7.77698127301408SNP_A-1780295	8.37503943134693SNP_A-1780299	8.94788041024013SNP_A-1780300	6.29155444584384SNP_A-1780301	6.87344411251538SNP_A-1780302	6.34429590791582!sample_table_end
