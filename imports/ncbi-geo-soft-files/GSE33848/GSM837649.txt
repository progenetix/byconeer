Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837649/suppl/GSM837649_SNP6.0_EA008.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.140829770773SNP_A-1780271	7.02652344251977SNP_A-1780272	8.71710517180536SNP_A-1780274	8.52290841355846SNP_A-1780277	9.58151445009565SNP_A-1780278	6.75988818322184SNP_A-1780283	7.71166697356435SNP_A-1780285	8.53980503510132SNP_A-1780286	7.14635653030391SNP_A-1780287	8.27146302790437SNP_A-1780289	8.69464808033133SNP_A-1780290	7.87139191438713SNP_A-1780292	7.97918698926457SNP_A-1780293	8.77093913760726SNP_A-1780294	8.81217730551445SNP_A-1780295	9.56001432332896SNP_A-1780299	9.73470962022584SNP_A-1780300	7.59991284218713SNP_A-1780301	7.25620868852739SNP_A-1780302	7.78626962764847!sample_table_end
