Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837696/suppl/GSM837696_SNP6.0_EA086.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.72451385311995SNP_A-1780271	7.79197682089869SNP_A-1780272	9.23641289165138SNP_A-1780274	9.16490692667569SNP_A-1780277	10.2898267820930SNP_A-1780278	7.34983409145725SNP_A-1780283	8.36959734627868SNP_A-1780285	9.10808879467584SNP_A-1780286	8.319672120947SNP_A-1780287	9.03983295513908SNP_A-1780289	8.92283213947754SNP_A-1780290	8.58558853459555SNP_A-1780292	8.48314397513762SNP_A-1780293	9.70072869060894SNP_A-1780294	9.31703568494734SNP_A-1780295	9.76652890859886SNP_A-1780299	10.1747176664898SNP_A-1780300	7.79007693062577SNP_A-1780301	8.17242750864548SNP_A-1780302	8.31854280970272!sample_table_end
