Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837786/suppl/GSM837786_SNP6.0_WE002.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.66355810421727SNP_A-1780271	7.62113611327464SNP_A-1780272	9.41080465015665SNP_A-1780274	9.34651373316563SNP_A-1780277	9.2950035789432SNP_A-1780278	7.80654962198596SNP_A-1780283	8.2556187498396SNP_A-1780285	9.03020731312245SNP_A-1780286	7.4262647547021SNP_A-1780287	8.48179943166575SNP_A-1780289	9.67183588535823SNP_A-1780290	8.82017896241519SNP_A-1780292	8.67830669965151SNP_A-1780293	9.5701719541366SNP_A-1780294	8.9915218460757SNP_A-1780295	9.36157830317195SNP_A-1780299	10.2701006176465SNP_A-1780300	8.38586240064146SNP_A-1780301	8.06339508128851SNP_A-1780302	7.62205181945638!sample_table_end
