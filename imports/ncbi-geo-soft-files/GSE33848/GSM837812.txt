Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837812/suppl/GSM837812_SNP6.0_WE028.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.85018683764577SNP_A-1780271	7.9614496943982SNP_A-1780272	9.70246131096237SNP_A-1780274	9.44914864537544SNP_A-1780277	9.62966018558118SNP_A-1780278	8.51865315567339SNP_A-1780283	8.93994645245869SNP_A-1780285	8.79387421248946SNP_A-1780286	7.8856963733394SNP_A-1780287	8.82017896241519SNP_A-1780289	9.4398308839814SNP_A-1780290	9.46590646256958SNP_A-1780292	8.78354396078654SNP_A-1780293	9.80036067545472SNP_A-1780294	9.31929578207936SNP_A-1780295	9.63360073546911SNP_A-1780299	10.4086835592954SNP_A-1780300	9.06384444900461SNP_A-1780301	8.20334800297976SNP_A-1780302	7.90162115834611!sample_table_end
