Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837789/suppl/GSM837789_SNP6.0_WE005.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.52552080909507SNP_A-1780271	7.84940510094776SNP_A-1780272	9.01680828768655SNP_A-1780274	9.23959852924912SNP_A-1780277	9.77038859570366SNP_A-1780278	7.79034849675191SNP_A-1780283	8.5980525001616SNP_A-1780285	8.93369065495223SNP_A-1780286	7.75933340719466SNP_A-1780287	8.67065624911844SNP_A-1780289	9.18982455888002SNP_A-1780290	8.95322643133126SNP_A-1780292	8.6122541923889SNP_A-1780293	9.78790255939143SNP_A-1780294	9.283088353024SNP_A-1780295	9.68328707127334SNP_A-1780299	10.3068212024972SNP_A-1780300	8.05437820793107SNP_A-1780301	8.14274527675153SNP_A-1780302	7.50283180406674!sample_table_end
