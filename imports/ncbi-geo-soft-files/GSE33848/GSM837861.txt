Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837861/suppl/GSM837861_SNP6.0_WE082.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.44294349584873SNP_A-1780271	7.46250227259726SNP_A-1780272	8.6122541923889SNP_A-1780274	8.8851879345532SNP_A-1780277	9.60208021361874SNP_A-1780278	7.16867211813223SNP_A-1780283	8.24019505397992SNP_A-1780285	8.4797802640291SNP_A-1780286	7.43323767809207SNP_A-1780287	8.8922898232168SNP_A-1780289	8.75655632252409SNP_A-1780290	8.35755200461808SNP_A-1780292	8.34355587453673SNP_A-1780293	9.53980503510132SNP_A-1780294	8.71539005960706SNP_A-1780295	9.4580647828734SNP_A-1780299	10.3007338726182SNP_A-1780300	7.34577483684173SNP_A-1780301	7.69435788722145SNP_A-1780302	7.65015421367509!sample_table_end
