Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837830/suppl/GSM837830_SNP6.0_WE046.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.96578428466209SNP_A-1780271	7.64835758200967SNP_A-1780272	9.62905299068969SNP_A-1780274	9.74679421153431SNP_A-1780277	10.4462217614197SNP_A-1780278	7.94982671075911SNP_A-1780283	8.60686783737415SNP_A-1780285	9.29040289992061SNP_A-1780286	8.07503339170882SNP_A-1780287	8.80143892291962SNP_A-1780289	9.29347164883813SNP_A-1780290	9.11243950678155SNP_A-1780292	8.8334172186438SNP_A-1780293	9.83552411210462SNP_A-1780294	9.18693957997656SNP_A-1780295	9.76708092507428SNP_A-1780299	10.3630396302565SNP_A-1780300	8.37068740680722SNP_A-1780301	8.15038196881785SNP_A-1780302	8.24198314969433!sample_table_end
