Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837650/suppl/GSM837650_SNP6.0_EA009.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.86805085374516SNP_A-1780271	6.85642552862553SNP_A-1780272	8.59121064838634SNP_A-1780274	8.60424433387587SNP_A-1780277	9.5745935273376SNP_A-1780278	6.64024493622235SNP_A-1780283	7.6812384117778SNP_A-1780285	8.4276620381439SNP_A-1780286	7.08569374839728SNP_A-1780287	8.2706846653061SNP_A-1780289	8.64024493622235SNP_A-1780290	8.08480838780436SNP_A-1780292	7.90086680798075SNP_A-1780293	9.1890008677124SNP_A-1780294	8.8610869059954SNP_A-1780295	9.395177076918SNP_A-1780299	10.0696735278068SNP_A-1780300	7.42486611664695SNP_A-1780301	7.35755200461808SNP_A-1780302	7.02097993890421!sample_table_end
