Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837661/suppl/GSM837661_SNP6.0_EA022.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.70735913208088SNP_A-1780271	7.14720492494223SNP_A-1780272	8.57805813885964SNP_A-1780274	8.26366043970818SNP_A-1780277	8.53397857200235SNP_A-1780278	6.86263735755879SNP_A-1780283	7.71596199025514SNP_A-1780285	8.28617268352189SNP_A-1780286	7.2823162389885SNP_A-1780287	8.16658155836794SNP_A-1780289	8.1006623390052SNP_A-1780290	8.03250496457304SNP_A-1780292	7.6888330984931SNP_A-1780293	9.24753198361496SNP_A-1780294	8.81698362325538SNP_A-1780295	9.07992916856493SNP_A-1780299	9.82044492149805SNP_A-1780300	7.02790599656988SNP_A-1780301	7.40407713624123SNP_A-1780302	6.97441458980553!sample_table_end
