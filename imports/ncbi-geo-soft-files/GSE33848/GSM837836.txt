Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837836/suppl/GSM837836_SNP6.0_WE052.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.11374216604919SNP_A-1780271	7.76652890859886SNP_A-1780272	8.87805091272854SNP_A-1780274	9.37757206279012SNP_A-1780277	9.7712143297952SNP_A-1780278	7.56128794516483SNP_A-1780283	8.42153890684828SNP_A-1780285	8.86624861111117SNP_A-1780286	7.88874324889826SNP_A-1780287	8.39945595807998SNP_A-1780289	9.15312975889933SNP_A-1780290	8.96530330614758SNP_A-1780292	8.4898479604393SNP_A-1780293	9.46454575033394SNP_A-1780294	8.97345821254751SNP_A-1780295	9.49818437009559SNP_A-1780299	10.0716858110262SNP_A-1780300	7.76376565350992SNP_A-1780301	8.19475685442225SNP_A-1780302	8.19105921453166!sample_table_end
