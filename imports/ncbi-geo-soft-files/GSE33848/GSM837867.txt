Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837867/suppl/GSM837867_SNP6.0_WE090.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.04507705193494SNP_A-1780271	7.16741814583174SNP_A-1780272	8.43809874901418SNP_A-1780274	8.75098606448114SNP_A-1780277	9.31741261376487SNP_A-1780278	7.06474276475026SNP_A-1780283	8.00772811463225SNP_A-1780285	8.00468864579363SNP_A-1780286	7.39660478118186SNP_A-1780287	8.19229281447077SNP_A-1780289	8.41855541138745SNP_A-1780290	8.38801728534514SNP_A-1780292	7.74483383749955SNP_A-1780293	9.47640869193865SNP_A-1780294	8.48649986183547SNP_A-1780295	8.90989308377004SNP_A-1780299	9.5758543489524SNP_A-1780300	7.33240957875569SNP_A-1780301	7.4241662888181SNP_A-1780302	7.07681559705083!sample_table_end
