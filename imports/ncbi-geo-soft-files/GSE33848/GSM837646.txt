Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837646/suppl/GSM837646_SNP6.0_EA003.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.1331422124006SNP_A-1780271	7.62021982550749SNP_A-1780272	9.07904026216534SNP_A-1780274	8.79766152585376SNP_A-1780277	9.800090987625SNP_A-1780278	6.77313920671969SNP_A-1780283	8.17804232886482SNP_A-1780285	8.48850965325531SNP_A-1780286	7.56096964509936SNP_A-1780287	8.14805282096481SNP_A-1780289	8.63903917347695SNP_A-1780290	8.27612440527424SNP_A-1780292	8.05347341326932SNP_A-1780293	9.0329640560776SNP_A-1780294	8.64205169292798SNP_A-1780295	9.28270234765959SNP_A-1780299	9.78980531337167SNP_A-1780300	7.68650052718322SNP_A-1780301	7.58590144969077SNP_A-1780302	7.9285183752579!sample_table_end
