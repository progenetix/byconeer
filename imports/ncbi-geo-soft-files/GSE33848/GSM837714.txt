Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837714/suppl/GSM837714_SNP6.0_EA122.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.71938882094208SNP_A-1780271	7.7099453802325SNP_A-1780272	9.16071182328098SNP_A-1780274	8.9507988772655SNP_A-1780277	9.38334429370964SNP_A-1780278	7.3037807481771SNP_A-1780283	8.0389189892923SNP_A-1780285	8.78517997877424SNP_A-1780286	6.93467375212205SNP_A-1780287	8.33985000288462SNP_A-1780289	8.89330153086056SNP_A-1780290	8.26912667914942SNP_A-1780292	8.0741414627525SNP_A-1780293	8.79928162152192SNP_A-1780294	9.09978611970047SNP_A-1780295	9.62296694479051SNP_A-1780299	10.3923174227788SNP_A-1780300	7.4374053123073SNP_A-1780301	7.68825030913318SNP_A-1780302	7.75822321472672!sample_table_end
