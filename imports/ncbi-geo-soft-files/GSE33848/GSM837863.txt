Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837863/suppl/GSM837863_SNP6.0_WE084.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.54206454228344SNP_A-1780271	7.4262647547021SNP_A-1780272	8.80574387215162SNP_A-1780274	8.55842071326866SNP_A-1780277	9.9243176673667SNP_A-1780278	7.23481743111732SNP_A-1780283	8.22098285108178SNP_A-1780285	8.50050995846013SNP_A-1780286	7.75488750216347SNP_A-1780287	8.12670447284319SNP_A-1780289	8.55522820247068SNP_A-1780290	8.50117372430615SNP_A-1780292	8.0741414627525SNP_A-1780293	9.56858953098696SNP_A-1780294	8.90638957284228SNP_A-1780295	9.76044274599664SNP_A-1780299	10.2041635457041SNP_A-1780300	7.83394423053675SNP_A-1780301	7.58777751632821SNP_A-1780302	7.71938882094208!sample_table_end
