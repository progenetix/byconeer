Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837720/suppl/GSM837720_SNP6.0_EA133.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.868822554775SNP_A-1780271	7.32418054661874SNP_A-1780272	7.55458885167764SNP_A-1780274	8.26990588253908SNP_A-1780277	8.15059352319038SNP_A-1780278	6.98868468677217SNP_A-1780283	7.4335854411505SNP_A-1780285	8.12412131182919SNP_A-1780286	6.44570463552579SNP_A-1780287	7.70274987882829SNP_A-1780289	7.92283213947754SNP_A-1780290	7.63178335747415SNP_A-1780292	7.75600026353055SNP_A-1780293	8.75377388185276SNP_A-1780294	8.43114933749936SNP_A-1780295	8.7873584541461SNP_A-1780299	9.42905796959378SNP_A-1780300	7.28386005405384SNP_A-1780301	7.23481743111732SNP_A-1780302	6.70908381255034!sample_table_end
