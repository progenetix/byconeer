Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837684/suppl/GSM837684_SNP6.0_EA064.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.89671081572611SNP_A-1780271	7.64295422348033SNP_A-1780272	9.39339045744399SNP_A-1780274	9.20008121405857SNP_A-1780277	9.43114933749935SNP_A-1780278	7.86805085374516SNP_A-1780283	8.30263892378755SNP_A-1780285	9.20620038783386SNP_A-1780286	7.80842795672283SNP_A-1780287	8.80789153915172SNP_A-1780289	9.64144969206763SNP_A-1780290	9.27301849440642SNP_A-1780292	8.90438373999794SNP_A-1780293	9.75460917766354SNP_A-1780294	9.3779335046161SNP_A-1780295	9.74875192537281SNP_A-1780299	10.7209567354816SNP_A-1780300	8.69174351917128SNP_A-1780301	8.15228484230658SNP_A-1780302	7.82972273508606!sample_table_end
