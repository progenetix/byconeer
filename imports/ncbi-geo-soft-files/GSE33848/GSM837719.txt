Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837719/suppl/GSM837719_SNP6.0_EA132.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.80976812871041SNP_A-1780271	7.42101285577923SNP_A-1780272	8.05618609669008SNP_A-1780274	8.5104345220714SNP_A-1780277	8.81804952285384SNP_A-1780278	6.97441458980553SNP_A-1780283	7.72706955802371SNP_A-1780285	8.08657856599073SNP_A-1780286	6.86005234514727SNP_A-1780287	7.91786930334559SNP_A-1780289	8.23122118071119SNP_A-1780290	7.86933679289874SNP_A-1780292	7.7998212493722SNP_A-1780293	8.58558853459555SNP_A-1780294	8.33687843635333SNP_A-1780295	9.13485410229697SNP_A-1780299	9.226010719281SNP_A-1780300	6.944468053425SNP_A-1780301	7.48884434645734SNP_A-1780302	6.98584193700334!sample_table_end
