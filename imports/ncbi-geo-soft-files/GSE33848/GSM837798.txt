Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837798/suppl/GSM837798_SNP6.0_WE014.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.81698362325538SNP_A-1780271	7.12023787734196SNP_A-1780272	8.75042785397277SNP_A-1780274	8.80950019388916SNP_A-1780277	9.0887882387169SNP_A-1780278	7.02790599656988SNP_A-1780283	8.28193002695544SNP_A-1780285	8.1232592293172SNP_A-1780286	7.23840473932508SNP_A-1780287	7.82230526352357SNP_A-1780289	8.21512848690384SNP_A-1780290	7.7369655941662SNP_A-1780292	8.12412131182919SNP_A-1780293	8.76652890859886SNP_A-1780294	8.44363427634595SNP_A-1780295	9.35755200461808SNP_A-1780299	9.35974956032233SNP_A-1780300	6.95225589981744SNP_A-1780301	7.26912667914942SNP_A-1780302	7.33203654836165!sample_table_end
