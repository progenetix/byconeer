Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837815/suppl/GSM837815_SNP6.0_WE031.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.94836723158468SNP_A-1780271	7.20823435833979SNP_A-1780272	8.32493058304889SNP_A-1780274	8.92876509523128SNP_A-1780277	9.23082104340703SNP_A-1780278	7.410451351504SNP_A-1780283	7.88950396341148SNP_A-1780285	8.34872815423108SNP_A-1780286	7.24317398347295SNP_A-1780287	8.17326071400557SNP_A-1780289	8.53786549408651SNP_A-1780290	8.10328780841202SNP_A-1780292	7.98299357469431SNP_A-1780293	9.45669665091606SNP_A-1780294	8.90789211945359SNP_A-1780295	9.25424128737579SNP_A-1780299	9.55969574211073SNP_A-1780300	7.42766203814391SNP_A-1780301	7.8462739113499SNP_A-1780302	6.94544383637791!sample_table_end
