Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837950/suppl/GSM837950_SNP6.0_WE143.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.24079133216196SNP_A-1780271	7.01820017881323SNP_A-1780272	7.51438530968203SNP_A-1780274	8.12928301694497SNP_A-1780277	8.54303182025524SNP_A-1780278	6.7797193551434SNP_A-1780283	7.37612538927617SNP_A-1780285	7.6558288314408SNP_A-1780286	6.47031993478003SNP_A-1780287	7.43879185257826SNP_A-1780289	7.67006606909758SNP_A-1780290	7.43462822763672SNP_A-1780292	7.4931883070135SNP_A-1780293	8.49385544924082SNP_A-1780294	7.98299357469431SNP_A-1780295	8.68474862042163SNP_A-1780299	9.27999741442144SNP_A-1780300	6.70043971814109SNP_A-1780301	7.3094763538411SNP_A-1780302	6.70390357344466!sample_table_end
