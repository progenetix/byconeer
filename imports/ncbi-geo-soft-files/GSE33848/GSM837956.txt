Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837956/suppl/GSM837956_SNP6.0_WE151.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.38262402657492SNP_A-1780271	6.70735913208088SNP_A-1780272	7.65344223860392SNP_A-1780274	8.27612440527424SNP_A-1780277	8.48381577726426SNP_A-1780278	6.60362634498619SNP_A-1780283	7.2749604721406SNP_A-1780285	7.75377388185276SNP_A-1780286	6.57742882803575SNP_A-1780287	7.41362792902417SNP_A-1780289	7.58996318177952SNP_A-1780290	7.49718654063272SNP_A-1780292	7.4484605008163SNP_A-1780293	8.30985526258678SNP_A-1780294	7.84025340257823SNP_A-1780295	8.34725225124723SNP_A-1780299	8.70735913208088SNP_A-1780300	6.48917896203135SNP_A-1780301	6.94836723158468SNP_A-1780302	7.31741261376487!sample_table_end
