Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837647/suppl/GSM837647_SNP6.0_EA006.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.6693280043959SNP_A-1780271	7.49884920653172SNP_A-1780272	9.04120281918334SNP_A-1780274	8.65642486327778SNP_A-1780277	9.05754052805936SNP_A-1780278	7.21553299974566SNP_A-1780283	7.53624721568813SNP_A-1780285	8.66651990989905SNP_A-1780286	7.60115173882049SNP_A-1780287	8.43393312040049SNP_A-1780289	8.67006606909757SNP_A-1780290	8.59556830662332SNP_A-1780292	8.17824986609325SNP_A-1780293	9.23641289165138SNP_A-1780294	9.10241318271631SNP_A-1780295	9.39909986896528SNP_A-1780299	9.64535821493996SNP_A-1780300	7.99435343685886SNP_A-1780301	7.48079020109582SNP_A-1780302	7.39339045744399!sample_table_end
