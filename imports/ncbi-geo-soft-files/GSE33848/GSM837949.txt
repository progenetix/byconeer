Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837949/suppl/GSM837949_SNP6.0_WE142.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.38154295118458SNP_A-1780271	6.89481776330794SNP_A-1780272	8.28694273693803SNP_A-1780274	8.1232592293172SNP_A-1780277	8.47640869193866SNP_A-1780278	6.84077792359505SNP_A-1780283	7.02513956227851SNP_A-1780285	7.3279268355088SNP_A-1780286	6.2667865406949SNP_A-1780287	7.35901741362259SNP_A-1780289	7.73809225962049SNP_A-1780290	7.59867288075206SNP_A-1780292	7.24792751344359SNP_A-1780293	8.22801697053032SNP_A-1780294	7.8212425046977SNP_A-1780295	8.53397857200235SNP_A-1780299	8.90036368851937SNP_A-1780300	6.54689445988764SNP_A-1780301	6.97584796800678SNP_A-1780302	6.53332973230583!sample_table_end
