Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837880/suppl/GSM837880_SNP6.0_WE115.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.90237511448603SNP_A-1780271	7.0042204663182SNP_A-1780272	8.48179943166575SNP_A-1780274	8.55074678538324SNP_A-1780277	9.51372759595244SNP_A-1780278	7.29920801838728SNP_A-1780283	7.54978466794786SNP_A-1780285	8.07859560349612SNP_A-1780286	6.82654848729092SNP_A-1780287	7.96866679319521SNP_A-1780289	8.29385478389307SNP_A-1780290	8.28154371150505SNP_A-1780292	7.96000193206808SNP_A-1780293	8.98773772576614SNP_A-1780294	8.35608510561943SNP_A-1780295	8.8538293518571SNP_A-1780299	9.37540150815668SNP_A-1780300	7.6060967138105SNP_A-1780301	7.40726776424473SNP_A-1780302	7.1611318829843!sample_table_end
