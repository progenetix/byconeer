Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837961/suppl/GSM837961_SNP6.0_WE156.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.03342300153745SNP_A-1780271	6.38801728534513SNP_A-1780272	7.15987133677839SNP_A-1780274	7.90388184573618SNP_A-1780277	8.32042450429698SNP_A-1780278	6.79116288855502SNP_A-1780283	6.83447104998422SNP_A-1780285	7.18982455888002SNP_A-1780286	6.33687843635333SNP_A-1780287	7.25108785433691SNP_A-1780289	7.620830748676SNP_A-1780290	7.1682542484578SNP_A-1780292	6.60238957247934SNP_A-1780293	7.36486421003795SNP_A-1780294	7.6888330984931SNP_A-1780295	8.21107710810861SNP_A-1780299	8.26912667914942SNP_A-1780300	6.4648860487294SNP_A-1780301	6.6183855022586SNP_A-1780302	6.73978060977326!sample_table_end
