Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837657/suppl/GSM837657_SNP6.0_EA017.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.31118066005335SNP_A-1780271	7.29920801838728SNP_A-1780272	8.86676376735335SNP_A-1780274	8.81431542378781SNP_A-1780277	9.8654755316745SNP_A-1780278	7.35974956032233SNP_A-1780283	7.99435343685886SNP_A-1780285	8.37937836707126SNP_A-1780286	7.55458885167764SNP_A-1780287	8.32418054661874SNP_A-1780289	8.65224746003386SNP_A-1780290	8.64445718750926SNP_A-1780292	8.20782779357991SNP_A-1780293	9.85330955540367SNP_A-1780294	9.10895998735986SNP_A-1780295	9.31401670390136SNP_A-1780299	10.0890090199616SNP_A-1780300	7.87241837835138SNP_A-1780301	7.88417051910843SNP_A-1780302	8.02790599656988!sample_table_end
