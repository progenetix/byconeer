Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837785/suppl/GSM837785_SNP6.0_WE001.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.13891171814274SNP_A-1780271	7.76071994746562SNP_A-1780272	8.87907265146876SNP_A-1780274	9.29385478389307SNP_A-1780277	9.89910512171104SNP_A-1780278	7.99647348873323SNP_A-1780283	8.60177078840771SNP_A-1780285	8.85330955540367SNP_A-1780286	7.82548885078284SNP_A-1780287	8.59121064838634SNP_A-1780289	8.98394365378093SNP_A-1780290	8.80574387215162SNP_A-1780292	8.64205169292798SNP_A-1780293	9.6235767060172SNP_A-1780294	9.4196091144465SNP_A-1780295	9.33203654836165SNP_A-1780299	10.4401770615573SNP_A-1780300	7.66770293172909SNP_A-1780301	8.01889562112165SNP_A-1780302	7.77231457392165!sample_table_end
