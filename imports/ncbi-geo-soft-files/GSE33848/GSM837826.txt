Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837826/suppl/GSM837826_SNP6.0_WE042.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.02444712404065SNP_A-1780271	7.5077946401987SNP_A-1780272	8.59058704991503SNP_A-1780274	9.19147053172358SNP_A-1780277	9.62601317700524SNP_A-1780278	7.44811630540946SNP_A-1780283	8.12605911607068SNP_A-1780285	8.7643187280963SNP_A-1780286	7.55330929945106SNP_A-1780287	8.3582848951804SNP_A-1780289	8.81003601378051SNP_A-1780290	8.68999797141945SNP_A-1780292	8.41574176829009SNP_A-1780293	9.78545246815854SNP_A-1780294	8.94349161004363SNP_A-1780295	9.27883660300769SNP_A-1780299	10.0336524195297SNP_A-1780300	7.81057163474115SNP_A-1780301	7.79522796602868SNP_A-1780302	7.65642486327778!sample_table_end
