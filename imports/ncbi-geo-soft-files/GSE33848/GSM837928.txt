Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837928/suppl/GSM837928_SNP6.0_WE131.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.0993478104032SNP_A-1780271	6.63662462054365SNP_A-1780272	8.1189410727235SNP_A-1780274	7.93467375212206SNP_A-1780277	8.73358030898157SNP_A-1780278	6.95274124718649SNP_A-1780283	7.27029532647204SNP_A-1780285	7.56605403817109SNP_A-1780286	6.85382935185711SNP_A-1780287	7.5352753766208SNP_A-1780289	7.38370429247405SNP_A-1780290	7.32042450429697SNP_A-1780292	7.34429590791582SNP_A-1780293	8.29232163280204SNP_A-1780294	8.10503547069829SNP_A-1780295	8.25187685902756SNP_A-1780299	9.51471405413849SNP_A-1780300	6.90086680798075SNP_A-1780301	6.94104760634058SNP_A-1780302	7.03754695396218!sample_table_end
