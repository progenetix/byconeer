Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837668/suppl/GSM837668_SNP6.0_EA033.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.36139553316589SNP_A-1780271	7.68999797141945SNP_A-1780272	9.1006623390052SNP_A-1780274	8.88060390408824SNP_A-1780277	9.88722061546838SNP_A-1780278	7.20212382383046SNP_A-1780283	8.10000522442272SNP_A-1780285	8.39945595807998SNP_A-1780286	7.60115173882049SNP_A-1780287	8.28386005405384SNP_A-1780289	8.78844645950754SNP_A-1780290	8.93957921431469SNP_A-1780292	8.4374053123073SNP_A-1780293	9.41256984680521SNP_A-1780294	8.79279029430106SNP_A-1780295	8.899860393541SNP_A-1780299	9.85200924432792SNP_A-1780300	7.95516553786095SNP_A-1780301	7.70390357344466SNP_A-1780302	8.01471792986001!sample_table_end
