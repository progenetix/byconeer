Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837959/suppl/GSM837959_SNP6.0_WE154.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.03066713624694SNP_A-1780271	6.65999589242998SNP_A-1780272	7.11721018464439SNP_A-1780274	8.03617361255349SNP_A-1780277	8.3234301200526SNP_A-1780278	6.33315535031062SNP_A-1780283	6.98726401207254SNP_A-1780285	7.35167543828141SNP_A-1780286	6.07681559705083SNP_A-1780287	7.27612440527424SNP_A-1780289	7.50647288560245SNP_A-1780290	6.86624861111118SNP_A-1780292	6.95225589981744SNP_A-1780293	7.76818432477693SNP_A-1780294	7.54946381949977SNP_A-1780295	8.1890008677124SNP_A-1780299	8.9834686924463SNP_A-1780300	6.36340473086352SNP_A-1780301	6.66888498426625SNP_A-1780302	6.74651432113846!sample_table_end
