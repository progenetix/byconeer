Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837822/suppl/GSM837822_SNP6.0_WE038.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.8073549220576SNP_A-1780271	6.7279204545632SNP_A-1780272	7.87446911791614SNP_A-1780274	8.29308841200738SNP_A-1780277	8.91488338636205SNP_A-1780278	6.85798099512757SNP_A-1780283	7.40407713624123SNP_A-1780285	7.87139191438713SNP_A-1780286	6.39803107397315SNP_A-1780287	7.70274987882829SNP_A-1780289	8.01680828768655SNP_A-1780290	7.9078921194536SNP_A-1780292	7.38801728534513SNP_A-1780293	8.68240943054412SNP_A-1780294	8.51438530968204SNP_A-1780295	8.72508217892635SNP_A-1780299	9.14338321398982SNP_A-1780300	6.83077926756893SNP_A-1780301	7.31174831500496SNP_A-1780302	6.33539035469393!sample_table_end
