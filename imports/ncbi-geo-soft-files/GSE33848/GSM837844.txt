Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837844/suppl/GSM837844_SNP6.0_WE060.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.20273604325017SNP_A-1780271	7.33985000288462SNP_A-1780272	8.97823377149558SNP_A-1780274	8.59058704991503SNP_A-1780277	8.92134508037915SNP_A-1780278	7.39767463294827SNP_A-1780283	7.90764180366553SNP_A-1780285	8.77862474580342SNP_A-1780286	7.55330929945106SNP_A-1780287	8.17824986609325SNP_A-1780289	8.54432051622381SNP_A-1780290	8.50448798039475SNP_A-1780292	7.99906043953638SNP_A-1780293	9.22761594341422SNP_A-1780294	8.59494658929378SNP_A-1780295	9.34022101871305SNP_A-1780299	9.80305478462398SNP_A-1780300	7.98773772576613SNP_A-1780301	7.54206454228344SNP_A-1780302	7.05528243550119!sample_table_end
