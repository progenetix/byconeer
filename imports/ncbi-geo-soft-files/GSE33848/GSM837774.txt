Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837774/suppl/GSM837774_SNP6.0_EA140.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.97799536861296SNP_A-1780271	7.47167521439204SNP_A-1780272	8.7369655941662SNP_A-1780274	8.65105169117893SNP_A-1780277	9.4998458870832SNP_A-1780278	7.42206476617281SNP_A-1780283	8.319672120947SNP_A-1780285	8.59121064838634SNP_A-1780286	7.35167543828141SNP_A-1780287	8.12239663135973SNP_A-1780289	8.46692615518422SNP_A-1780290	8.25345357507618SNP_A-1780292	8.03066713624694SNP_A-1780293	9.02652344251977SNP_A-1780294	8.81804952285384SNP_A-1780295	9.77313920671969SNP_A-1780299	9.79495731692538SNP_A-1780300	7.4262647547021SNP_A-1780301	7.85096815098244SNP_A-1780302	7.61010206299966!sample_table_end
