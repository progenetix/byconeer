Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837689/suppl/GSM837689_SNP6.0_EA073.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.04712391211403SNP_A-1780271	7.31061278165953SNP_A-1780272	8.84549005094438SNP_A-1780274	8.8475793996671SNP_A-1780277	9.47235237706155SNP_A-1780278	7.1357092861044SNP_A-1780283	7.77478705960117SNP_A-1780285	8.60917873814198SNP_A-1780286	7.64024493622235SNP_A-1780287	8.34207466799914SNP_A-1780289	8.71138018397173SNP_A-1780290	8.41925796559704SNP_A-1780292	8.03800444406935SNP_A-1780293	8.68708402366878SNP_A-1780294	8.83605035505807SNP_A-1780295	9.66533591718518SNP_A-1780299	10.4684543440363SNP_A-1780300	7.47167521439204SNP_A-1780301	7.52160043972373SNP_A-1780302	7.19229281447077!sample_table_end
