Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837876/suppl/GSM837876_SNP6.0_WE108.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.23122118071119SNP_A-1780271	6.5980525001616SNP_A-1780272	7.82866542830301SNP_A-1780274	8.16071182328098SNP_A-1780277	8.69696752623429SNP_A-1780278	6.61102479730735SNP_A-1780283	6.98156728190301SNP_A-1780285	7.77038859570365SNP_A-1780286	6.51306958223937SNP_A-1780287	7.39660478118186SNP_A-1780289	7.89077093024524SNP_A-1780290	7.55714455658139SNP_A-1780292	7.0945175987843SNP_A-1780293	8.58996318177952SNP_A-1780294	7.83920378809694SNP_A-1780295	8.21350930038046SNP_A-1780299	8.90638957284228SNP_A-1780300	6.62205181945638SNP_A-1780301	6.93369065495223SNP_A-1780302	6.62388149001346!sample_table_end
