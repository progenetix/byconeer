Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837687/suppl/GSM837687_SNP6.0_EA068.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.4542992936199SNP_A-1780271	7.69870466677034SNP_A-1780272	8.88823588295637SNP_A-1780274	8.73245011304371SNP_A-1780277	8.83710226545166SNP_A-1780278	6.79928162152192SNP_A-1780283	7.83526091862749SNP_A-1780285	8.5274770060604SNP_A-1780286	7.78026634853039SNP_A-1780287	8.2823162389885SNP_A-1780289	8.61102479730735SNP_A-1780290	8.3279268355088SNP_A-1780292	8.16741814583174SNP_A-1780293	9.30149619498255SNP_A-1780294	9.09495737779726SNP_A-1780295	9.47235237706155SNP_A-1780299	10.1450830021580SNP_A-1780300	7.58996318177952SNP_A-1780301	7.52845411076479SNP_A-1780302	7.2167458581953!sample_table_end
