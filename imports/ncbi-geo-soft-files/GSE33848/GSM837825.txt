Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837825/suppl/GSM837825_SNP6.0_WE041.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.49785183695112SNP_A-1780271	7.35865120089289SNP_A-1780272	8.90237511448603SNP_A-1780274	9.0692259723384SNP_A-1780277	9.67301455784282SNP_A-1780278	7.91513244895065SNP_A-1780283	8.24614677463586SNP_A-1780285	8.98631611779344SNP_A-1780286	7.43601743818306SNP_A-1780287	8.51766938813381SNP_A-1780289	8.81057163474115SNP_A-1780290	8.97441458980553SNP_A-1780292	8.19967234483636SNP_A-1780293	9.4241662888181SNP_A-1780294	8.98679014278239SNP_A-1780295	9.40726776424473SNP_A-1780299	9.84496724063212SNP_A-1780300	7.96096726836431SNP_A-1780301	7.94763693795183SNP_A-1780302	7.4093909361377!sample_table_end
