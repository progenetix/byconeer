Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837962/suppl/GSM837962_SNP6.0_WE157.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	6.25738784269265SNP_A-1780271	6.0741414627525SNP_A-1780272	6.5571445565814SNP_A-1780274	6.96962635095648SNP_A-1780277	7.50382573799575SNP_A-1780278	5.85174904141606SNP_A-1780283	6.4241662888181SNP_A-1780285	6.90488545971814SNP_A-1780286	5.7944158663501SNP_A-1780287	6.52617316951355SNP_A-1780289	6.64625867999003SNP_A-1780290	6.61470984411521SNP_A-1780292	6.55969574211073SNP_A-1780293	7.42346612134943SNP_A-1780294	6.81804952285384SNP_A-1780295	7.57868717529467SNP_A-1780299	8.53008114944056SNP_A-1780300	6.15650448567999SNP_A-1780301	6.50977500432694SNP_A-1780302	5.81698362325538!sample_table_end
