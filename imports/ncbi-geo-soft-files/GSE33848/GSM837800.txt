Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837800/suppl/GSM837800_SNP6.0_WE016.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.22761594341422SNP_A-1780271	7.80332391904149SNP_A-1780272	8.58370961741108SNP_A-1780274	9.26522433692462SNP_A-1780277	9.85772186714468SNP_A-1780278	7.82336724004623SNP_A-1780283	8.44914864537544SNP_A-1780285	9.07101536176578SNP_A-1780286	7.37359021470985SNP_A-1780287	8.49585502688717SNP_A-1780289	8.79658045046343SNP_A-1780290	8.6244908649078SNP_A-1780292	8.81591693556103SNP_A-1780293	9.61930295541569SNP_A-1780294	8.98204286952588SNP_A-1780295	9.50614225765534SNP_A-1780299	10.0876838254035SNP_A-1780300	7.71995916886051SNP_A-1780301	7.9270371687203SNP_A-1780302	7.28771237954945!sample_table_end
