Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837717/suppl/GSM837717_SNP6.0_EA127.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.1611318829843SNP_A-1780271	7.51076416791789SNP_A-1780272	8.12928301694497SNP_A-1780274	8.58308276750293SNP_A-1780277	8.79007693062577SNP_A-1780278	7.08214904135387SNP_A-1780283	7.84862294042934SNP_A-1780285	8.20945336562895SNP_A-1780286	6.91288933622996SNP_A-1780287	7.91488338636205SNP_A-1780289	8.33613458738564SNP_A-1780290	7.72109918870719SNP_A-1780292	7.63783240214696SNP_A-1780293	8.7758845834585SNP_A-1780294	8.57175264350355SNP_A-1780295	9.09803208296053SNP_A-1780299	9.43114933749935SNP_A-1780300	7.20130712692731SNP_A-1780301	7.57553924683453SNP_A-1780302	7.00982861736811!sample_table_end
