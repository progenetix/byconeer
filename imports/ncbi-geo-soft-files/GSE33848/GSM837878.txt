Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837878/suppl/GSM837878_SNP6.0_WE112.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	7.50878516206451SNP_A-1780271	7.16364967601583SNP_A-1780272	8.40087943628218SNP_A-1780274	8.1623913287569SNP_A-1780277	9.03112681286096SNP_A-1780278	6.8008998999203SNP_A-1780283	7.44190670454224SNP_A-1780285	8.05799172275918SNP_A-1780286	6.77478705960117SNP_A-1780287	7.63541582697407SNP_A-1780289	8.14210705730255SNP_A-1780290	7.76708092507427SNP_A-1780292	7.43323767809207SNP_A-1780293	8.96289600533726SNP_A-1780294	8.24396732693033SNP_A-1780295	8.7176764230664SNP_A-1780299	9.7936033092794SNP_A-1780300	6.88467931651836SNP_A-1780301	7.20334800297976SNP_A-1780302	6.4655664048094!sample_table_end
