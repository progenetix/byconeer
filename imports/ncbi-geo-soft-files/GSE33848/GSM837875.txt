Systematic sources of variation (GC content, fragment length) were removed by subtracting for each log-ratio its estimated predicted values inferred from the least squares estimates of the parameters. Data from the sex chromosomes were not considered. To reduce measurement variability while keeping a sufficient level of resolution, we averaged the intensities over fifty consecutive probes leading to a total of 17,769 genomic segments (average size of 150kb) providing tiling coverage of the human genome.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Cyril,,Dalmasso!Sample_contact_email = cyril.dalmasso@genopole.cnrs.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = Statistique et GÃ©nome!Sample_contact_department = MathÃ©matiques!Sample_contact_institute = UniversitÃ© d'Evry Val d'Essonne!Sample_contact_address = 23 bd de France!Sample_contact_city = Evry!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM837nnn/GSM837875/suppl/GSM837875_SNP6.0_WE107.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33848!Sample_data_row_count = 1852426#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log-ratio between the signal and a reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	8.46709603390575SNP_A-1780271	7.4178525148859SNP_A-1780272	8.27612440527424SNP_A-1780274	8.97871045910636SNP_A-1780277	9.62540444491144SNP_A-1780278	7.28540221886225SNP_A-1780283	8.13442632022093SNP_A-1780285	8.53786549408651SNP_A-1780286	7.70735913208088SNP_A-1780287	8.06519171295394SNP_A-1780289	8.62570884306447SNP_A-1780290	8.43879185257826SNP_A-1780292	8.12756449971867SNP_A-1780293	9.3121266275916SNP_A-1780294	8.6134825407312SNP_A-1780295	9.73358030898157SNP_A-1780299	9.6949382150816SNP_A-1780300	7.30985526258679SNP_A-1780301	7.77807712953536SNP_A-1780302	7.50283180406674!sample_table_end
