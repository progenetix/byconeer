DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to 250K_Nsp!Sample_data_processing = CEL files and TXT files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by dChip and model-based expression performed using the PM/MM model. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758. The data matrix contains the normalized expression values produced by that algorithm.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Qiyuan,,Li!Sample_contact_email = qiyuan_li@dfci.harvard.edu!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Dana Farber Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 44 Binney Street!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM854nnn/GSM854620/suppl/GSM854620.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM854nnn/GSM854620/suppl/GSM854620_57N_HCC1143-BL_rehybe.TXT.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34754!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#Signal = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SignalSNP_A-1780270	BB	8.806404734SNP_A-1780272	BB	7.583727951SNP_A-1780285	AB	8.881835177SNP_A-1780286	AA	8.178423792SNP_A-1780287	BB	9.151125195SNP_A-1780289	BB	9.126573183SNP_A-1780292	AB	9.313033352SNP_A-1780294	AB	9.525870778SNP_A-1780295	NoCall	9.927779762SNP_A-1780300	AB	7.622159043SNP_A-1780302	AB	8.784418105SNP_A-1780303	NoCall	9.181174886SNP_A-1780304	AB	9.741929098SNP_A-1780305	AB	9.461946082SNP_A-1780311	AA	8.42343648SNP_A-1780312	BB	8.441027507SNP_A-1780313	AB	9.334675796SNP_A-1780316	AA	9.658918383SNP_A-1780318	AB	8.138414001SNP_A-1780320	AA	NA!sample_table_end
