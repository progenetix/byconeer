Medulloblastoma cell lines ONS76, UW228, and MED8A were grown as a monolayer in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. DAOY and D283 cell lines were grown as monolayers in AMEM with 10% FBS. The RES256 cell line was grown adherent in DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 2% FBS. D425, D458, and D556 were grown as suspension cultures in IMEM with 20% FBS, 10mM HEPES, and 0.225% Sodium Bicarbonate. MHH-MED-1 and D341 were grown in suspension in DMEM and AMEM with 10% FBS, respectively!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Fresh-frozen medulloblastoma specimens were stored at -80Â°C prior to being processed for extraction of nucleic acid. Tissue samples were pulverized under liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle.  For genomic DNA isolation, approximately 25-50mg of crushed tissue was subjected to digestion using SDS/Proteinase K (Roche) for 3 hours at 50Â°C. Homogenates were extracted 3 times with buffer-saturated phenol (Invitrogen) prior to precipitation of DNA with two volumes of anhydrous ethanol and 10% (vol/vol) 10M ammonium acetate.  Precipitated DNA was washed 3 times with 70% ethanol and re-suspended in reduced EDTA-TE (10mM Tris, 0.1mM EDTA; pH=8.0). Samples were quantitated by Nanodrop and integrity of isolated DNA was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis prior to submission for SNP array.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = MB samples were processed and hybridized to Affymetrix SNP arrays at The Centre for Applied Genomics (TCAG) at the Hospital for Sick Children. Genomic DNA samples isolated from primary medulloblastomas and cell lines were genotyped using the Affymetrix 50K Hind 240 and 50K Xba 240, or the 250K Nsp and 250K Sty GeneChip Mapping arrays as directed by the manufacturer. Briefly, 250ng of DNA was digested with HindIII, XbaI, NspI, or StyI (NEB), adapter-ligated and PCR amplified using a single primer with AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems). Amplified PCR products were pooled, concentrated, and fragmented with DNAase I. Products were subsequently labeled, denatured, and hybridized overnight to the respective arrays. Arrays were washed using an Affymetrix fluidics station and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000. CEL files were generated using the Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS) 3.0.!Sample_hyb_protocol = See label protocol above!Sample_scan_protocol = See label protocol above!Sample_description = MDT-MB-207_Sty!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix CEL files were extracted using the Affymetrix Data Transfer Tool (Version 1.1.0). For SNP genotyping, the BRLMM Analysis Tool (Version 1.0) was employed for individual array platforms using default parameters. Copy number and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses were performed using dChip 2006. Arrays were normalized by invariant set normalization and signal intensities computed using PM/MM model-based expression. Raw copy number data was computed using 100 normal control samples as a reference (provided by SWS) and inferred copy numbers were predicted using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Paul,A.,Northcott!Sample_contact_email = panorthcott@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = HEIDELBERG!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM360nnn/GSM360776/suppl/GSM360776.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14437!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #VALUE = MBEI (dChip) signal intensity#GENOTYPE = BRLMM (BRLMM Analysis Tool) SNP genotype!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	GENOTYPESNP_A-1780358	831.669	ASNP_A-1780551	1025.243	BSNP_A-1780357	461.32	BSNP_A-1780550	968.335	ASNP_A-1780352	810.734	ASNP_A-1780351	1653.423	ABSNP_A-1780350	1803.567	ABSNP_A-1780748	1916.681	ASNP_A-1780747	1830.822	ASNP_A-1780746	681.864	BSNP_A-1780745	2148.961	ABSNP_A-1780743	1380.181	ABSNP_A-1780549	1026.395	ASNP_A-1780547	1177.853	BSNP_A-1780541	515.892	BSNP_A-1780346	500.328	ASNP_A-1780345	914.743	BSNP_A-1780342	1560.216	ASNP_A-1780341	976.194	ASNP_A-1780340	585.303	AB!sample_table_end
