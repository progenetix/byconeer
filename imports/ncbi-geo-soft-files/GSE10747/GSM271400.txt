MCFDCIS cells were injected subcutaneously into 6-9 week old female nude mice alone or together with 2-3 fold excess of HME, RASF, PBS, or PBTS cells in 50% Matrigel. Tumors were allowed to grow for 3-8 weeks.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = We use the guanidinium thiocyanate/cesium chloride centrifugation method to isolate RNA/DNA from large amounts of tissue/cells and the mMACS mRNA isolation kit for small amounts (less than 1 million cells). The DNA fraction was extracted with PC8, treated with proteinase K and isopropanol precipitated.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = standard Affymetrix protocol!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Standard Affymetrix protocol!Sample_hyb_protocol = SNP array hybridizations were performed by the Dana-Farber Microarray Core using Affymetrix 11K XbaI or 250K StyI SNP arrays and protocols recommended by Affymetrix!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned using a confocal laser scanner, and Affymetrix genotyping software (Affymetrix GeneChip 5.0) was used to make allele calls for all loci.!Sample_description = MUC1+ cells isolated from 25-day xenograft!Sample_data_processing = Data were then analyzed using dChip or genepattern software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Kornelia,,Polyak!Sample_contact_email = kornelia_polyak@dfci.harvard.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 617-632-2106!Sample_contact_laboratory = Polyak!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Dana-Farber Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 450 Brookline Ave!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02215!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM271nnn/GSM271400/suppl/GSM271400.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM271nnn/GSM271400/suppl/GSM271400.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE10747!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number (GenePattern)#Call = genotype (GenePattern)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CallSNP_A-1909444	2.087	BBSNP_A-2237149	1.419	BBSNP_A-4303947	2.035	AASNP_A-2236359	1.234	BBSNP_A-2205441	1.693	AASNP_A-2116190	1.207	ABSNP_A-4291020	1.283	AASNP_A-2109914	0.995	ABSNP_A-2291997	1.828	AASNP_A-4277872	2.142	AASNP_A-2118217	1.507	ABSNP_A-1866065	1.854	ABSNP_A-2288244	2.040	ABSNP_A-1783407	2.896	ABSNP_A-2169457	1.672	BBSNP_A-4271011	1.020	BBSNP_A-2082515	1.566	BBSNP_A-1910751	1.749	AASNP_A-2081399	1.645	AASNP_A-2223642	1.880	BB!sample_table_end
