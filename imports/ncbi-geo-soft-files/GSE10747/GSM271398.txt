MCFDCIS cells were injected subcutaneously into 6-9 week old female nude mice alone or together with 2-3 fold excess of HME, RASF, PBS, or PBTS cells in 50% Matrigel. Tumors were allowed to grow for 3-8 weeks.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = We use the guanidinium thiocyanate/cesium chloride centrifugation method to isolate RNA/DNA from large amounts of tissue/cells and the mMACS mRNA isolation kit for small amounts (less than 1 million cells).
