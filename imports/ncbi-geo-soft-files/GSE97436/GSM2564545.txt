DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, Qubit fluorometer or PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Molecular Diagnostic Software (AMDS version 1.1).  Copy number values for individual probes is extracted and converted to an intensity data (CEL) file by and subsequently converted graphical, tabular and segmental data files (CYCHP for CytoScan, OSCHP for OncoScan) using Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS 3.0) software. Estimation of ploidy and aberrant call percentage in OSCHP files is calculated using the TuScan algorithm.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Carrie,A,Fitzpatrick!Sample_contact_institute = University of Chicago!Sample_contact_address = 5841 S Maryland Ave!Sample_contact_city = Chicago!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60637!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2564nnn/GSM2564545/suppl/GSM2564545_20150629_132804_002_CL011B.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2564nnn/GSM2564545/suppl/GSM2564545_CLL011B_20150629_132804_002_CL011B.cyhd.ND.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE97436!Sample_data_row_count = 0
