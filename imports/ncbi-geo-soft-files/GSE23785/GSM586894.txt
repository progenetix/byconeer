After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48Â¡C, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium HumanHap610 Quod Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium HumanHap610 Quod Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio genotyping version 3.2.32 (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8887!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Yau!Sample_contact_department = Department of Statistics!Sample_contact_institute = University of Oxford!Sample_contact_address = 1 South Parks Road!Sample_contact_city = Oxford!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = OX1 3TG!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE23785!Sample_data_row_count = 592530#ID_REF = #VALUE = BeadStudio normalized Log R ratio#B Allele Freq = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	B Allele Freq200047	-0.0630	0.0149200050	0.4527	1.0000200052	0.0137	1.0000200053	0.1310	0.0000200070	0.0008	0.2412200078	0.3466	1.0000200087	0.2872	0.7579200091	0.6271	0.2918200096	0.0935	0.7111200124	0.1842	1.0000200199	-1.2491	1.0000200240	-0.0786	0.7012200251	0.1354	0.0000200258	0.4608	0.0000200260	0.2186	0.9914200261	0.2001	0.0000200262	-0.4403	0.3376200519	0.5819	0.0000200521	-0.0888	1.0000200623	0.3362	0.8088!sample_table_end
