After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48Â¡C, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium HumanHap610 Quod Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium HumanHap610 Quod Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio genotyping version 3.2.32 (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8887!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Yau!Sample_contact_department = Department of Statistics!Sample_contact_institute = University of Oxford!Sample_contact_address = 1 South Parks Road!Sample_contact_city = Oxford!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = OX1 3TG!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE23785!Sample_data_row_count = 592530#ID_REF = #VALUE = BeadStudio normalized Log R ratio#B Allele Freq = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	B Allele Freq200047	0.2730	0.0260200050	0.3013	1.0000200052	0.1042	0.9993200053	0.1873	0.0000200070	-0.2187	0.4685200078	0.2054	0.9956200087	-0.0005	0.5833200091	0.1774	0.4272200096	-0.1737	0.5138200124	0.0551	1.0000200199	-0.2524	0.9985200240	0.0258	0.5533200251	0.0470	0.0095200258	0.1041	0.0000200260	0.0294	1.0000200261	0.0680	0.0000200262	-0.2389	0.4568200519	0.2108	0.0000200521	-0.1377	1.0000200623	0.0109	0.5372!sample_table_end
