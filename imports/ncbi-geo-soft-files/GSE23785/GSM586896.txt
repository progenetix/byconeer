After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48Â¡C, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium HumanHap610 Quod Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium HumanHap610 Quod Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio genotyping version 3.2.32 (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8887!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Yau!Sample_contact_department = Department of Statistics!Sample_contact_institute = University of Oxford!Sample_contact_address = 1 South Parks Road!Sample_contact_city = Oxford!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = OX1 3TG!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE23785!Sample_data_row_count = 592530#ID_REF = #VALUE = BeadStudio normalized Log R ratio#B Allele Freq = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	B Allele Freq200047	-0.0911	0.0149200050	0.2916	1.0000200052	0.0094	0.9897200053	0.1145	0.0000200070	0.4759	0.2879200078	0.3422	1.0000200087	0.4021	0.7531200091	0.4013	0.3449200096	0.1572	0.6491200124	0.0215	1.0000200199	-0.6933	1.0000200240	0.0384	0.6048200251	0.1908	0.0000200258	0.1589	0.0000200260	0.1335	1.0000200261	0.1199	0.0000200262	-0.2150	0.3072200519	0.2264	0.0000200521	-0.2735	0.9854200623	0.0144	0.7653!sample_table_end
