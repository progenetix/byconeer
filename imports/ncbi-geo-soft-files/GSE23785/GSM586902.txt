After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48Â¡C, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium HumanHap610 Quod Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium HumanHap610 Quod Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio genotyping version 3.2.32 (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8887!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Yau!Sample_contact_department = Department of Statistics!Sample_contact_institute = University of Oxford!Sample_contact_address = 1 South Parks Road!Sample_contact_city = Oxford!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = OX1 3TG!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE23785!Sample_data_row_count = 592530#ID_REF = #VALUE = BeadStudio normalized Log R ratio#B Allele Freq = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	B Allele Freq200047	0.0290	0.0000200050	0.0318	0.9970200052	0.0673	0.9958200053	-0.1089	0.0008200070	-0.0541	0.9969200078	-0.0779	0.9773200087	-0.0396	0.0113200091	0.0217	0.9923200096	-0.1598	1.0000200124	0.0505	0.5817200199	-0.4271	0.9956200240	-0.1621	0.0000200251	-0.0260	0.0000200258	-0.1862	0.3497200260	-0.1487	0.7233200261	-0.0242	0.3615200262	-0.2399	0.6306200519	0.0120	0.5123200521	0.1594	0.5245200623	0.1360	0.4185!sample_table_end
