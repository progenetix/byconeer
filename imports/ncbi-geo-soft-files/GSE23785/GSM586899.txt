After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48Â¡C, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium HumanHap610 Quod Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Genomic DNA extracted from breast tumors was genotyped using Infinium HumanHap610 Quod Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio genotyping version 3.2.32 (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8887!Sample_contact_name = Christopher,,Yau!Sample_contact_department = Department of Statistics!Sample_contact_institute = University of Oxford!Sample_contact_address = 1 South Parks Road!Sample_contact_city = Oxford!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = OX1 3TG!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE23785!Sample_data_row_count = 592530#ID_REF = #VALUE = BeadStudio normalized Log R ratio#B Allele Freq = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	B Allele Freq200047	0.2644	0.0000200050	0.0867	1.0000200052	0.1609	0.9933200053	0.3023	0.0004200070	0.0582	0.0000200078	-0.0273	0.9794200087	-0.1386	0.0201200091	0.0156	0.0020200096	-0.3520	0.9921200124	0.0915	0.5234200199	-0.2193	0.9985200240	-0.0369	0.0000200251	0.1679	0.0021200258	0.0729	0.0004200260	-0.0597	1.0000200261	0.0817	0.0048200262	-0.0163	0.9992200519	0.1300	0.0000200521	0.1561	0.9962200623	0.0825	0.5696!sample_table_end
