Some of the normal breast tissue samples were preserved in ethanol prior to extraction.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 1ug of genomic DNA from tumor and reference was digested using AluI and RsaI for 2 hrs on 37ÂºC folowed by a 20 min incubation on 65ÂºC for inactivation of enzymes. The samples were labeled using Agilent DNA Labeling Kit PLUS (containing random primers, 10X dNTPs, exo-Klenow-polymerase, buffer and Cy3- and Cy5-dUTPs). Samples were labeled with Cy5 and reference DNA with Cy3. Standard protocol provided by manufacturer was followed.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Reference genomic DNA, Promega!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: Female!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = DNA was isolated from snap frozen tumor tissue using chloroform/phenol extraction followed by ethanol precipitation (Nucler Acid Extractor 340A; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
