DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Operating Software (GCOS version 1.4). Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using the Birdseed algorithum and Genotyping Console and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in Partek Genomics Suite.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Nicola,Emma,Potter!Sample_contact_email = nicola.potter@icr.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = 02087224179!Sample_contact_laboratory = Haemto-oncology Unit!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Cancer Research!Sample_contact_address = 15 Cotswold Rd!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_state = Sutton, Surrey!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SM25NG!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1195nnn/GSM1195447/suppl/GSM1195447_DS-ALL.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1195nnn/GSM1195447/suppl/GSM1195447_DS_ALL.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE49215!Sample_data_row_count = 909622
