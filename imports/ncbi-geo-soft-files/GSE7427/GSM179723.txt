After overnight incubation at 37Â°C, the labelled DNA were purified using a G-50 spin column (GE Healthcare).!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Pooled genomic DNA from 20 normal human female blood labeled with Cyanine-3 (green).!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Blood!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Female!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Proteinase K digestion followed by phenol:chloroform extraction!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = 400ng of tumour and reference genomic DNA were labelled with Cy5-dCTP and Cy3-dCTP (GE Healthcare), respectively, using BioPrime kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerâs instruction, except that custom-prepared dNTP (dCTP 1mM, dATP 2mM, dGTP 2mM and dTTP 2mM) was used. After overnight incubation at 37Â°C, the labelled DNA were purified using a G-50 spin column (GE Healthcare).!Sample_hyb_protocol = The purified DNA from test and reference were pooled and mixed with 45Âµg of Cot1 DNA and ethanol precipitated. The precipitated DNA was dissolved in 30Âµl of hybridisation buffer, incubated at 37ËC for 2 hours and applied to the prehybridised microarray. Hybridisation was performed in a humidified Micro Array Hybridisation Chamber (Camlab, Cambridge, UK) at 37ËC for 48 hours under a coverslip. The arrays were then washed successively in 1x PBS/0.05% Tween20 at room temperature for 15 min twice, 50% formamide/2xSSC at 42ËC for 30 min once, 1x PBS/0.05% Tween20 at room temperature for 15min and 1x PBS for 5min twice.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4100A personal scanner.!Sample_scan_protocol = Images were quantified using GenePix Pro version 5.1.!Sample_description = Normalised aginst median of the 5Mb clones!Sample_data_processing = The median of the ratio of test/reference spot intensity, after subtraction of local background, of the 5Mb-clones in each subarray was used as the normalization factor. The chromosomal arm on which most microsatellite markers showed allelic balance was chosen for normalization. The test/reference ratio of each clone was divided by the normalization factor for each subarray, an average of the duplicate calculated and log2-transformed.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5056!Sample_contact_name = Koichi,,Ichimura!Sample_contact_email = ki212@cam.ac.uk!Sample_contact_phone = +441223762084!Sample_contact_fax = +441223586670!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Histopathology!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Cambridge!Sample_contact_address = Addenbrooke's Hospital Box 231!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB2 2QQ!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_contact_web_link = http://www.path.cam.ac.uk/pages/collins-ichimura/!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM179nnn/GSM179723/suppl/GSM179723.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE7427!Sample_series_id = GSE7428!Sample_data_row_count = 2765#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 ratio (Cy5/Cy3)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	0.0698596472	3	-0.0925736214	0.1440483975	0.1394410486	0.1695449237	0.1884880788	0.1426161669	0.07111507510	-0.31685868411	-0.4757173112	-0.412165313	-0.25910194814	-0.4872502415	-0.23652628816	-0.22903214517	18	-0.30288022119	-0.18483195920	-0.207465581!sample_table_end
