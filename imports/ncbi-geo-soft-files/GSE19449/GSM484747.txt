PCR-amplified product was then fragmented by DNaseI, denatured to generate single stranded product and end-labeled by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The sample was hybridized to the array as specified by the manufacturer. The probe array was then stained and washed on station.!Sample_scan_protocol = The probe array was scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = This tumor has been characterized previously to determine which telomere maintenance mechanism is active and interrogated for copy number changes using whole genome profiling (Johnson, J.
