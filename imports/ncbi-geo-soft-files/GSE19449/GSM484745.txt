DNA was also checked for excessive shearing by agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 250 ng of purified DNA was digested with XbaI and the resulting fragments were ligated to adaptor sequences using T4 DNA ligase.  PCR-amplified product was then fragmented by DNaseI, denatured to generate single stranded product and end-labeled by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The sample was hybridized to the array as specified by the manufacturer. The probe array was then stained and washed on station.!Sample_scan_protocol = The probe array was scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Passage 2.!Sample_data_processing = standard Affymetrix protocol!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Jay,,Johnson!Sample_contact_email = johe@mail.med.upenn.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 215-573-6529!Sample_contact_laboratory = F.
