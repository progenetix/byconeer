Nexus Copy Numberâ¢ software was used to analyze the DNA copy number variations (BioDiscovery, Hawthorne, CA, USA), while computational analysis to compare the samples was performed in R v.2.10.1. Furthermore, breakpoints, gains, losses and amplifications were detected also using the algorithm CGH call. This algorithm converts raw log2ratios to absolute measures of ââlossââ, âânormalââ, ââgainââ or ââamplificationââ by applying a segmentation algorithm.!Sample_data_processing = Normalized log2 ratio (sample/references) data is available on Series records ('normalized_data.txt')!Sample_platform_id = GPL16694!Sample_contact_name = Amir,,Avan!Sample_contact_email = amir_avan@yahoo.com!Sample_contact_institute = VU University Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = DE BOELELAAN 1118!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1088nnn/GSM1088670/suppl/GSM1088670_US22502676_252252210209_S01_CGH_107_Sep09_1_6.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE44587!Sample_data_row_count = 0
