After deparaffination and rehydration, sections were haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained and tumoral areas were delimited by a pathologist and macrodissected with a surgical blade to ensure at least 80% of tumor content. DNA extraction was performed by standard protocols of proteinase-K overnight digestion and using a column-based commercially available kit following manufacturerÂ´s instructions (QIAamp DNA mini kit; Qiagen, Westburg, Leusden, The Netherlands) DNA isolation protocol available via www.vumc.nl/microarrays.
