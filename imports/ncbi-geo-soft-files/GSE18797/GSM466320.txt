DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to 250K_Sty!Sample_data_processing = CEL files and TXT files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by dChip and model-based expression performed using the PM/MM model. Normalization was performed using the invariant set probe selection method and the running median smoothing method. The data matrix contains the normalized expression values produced by that algorithm.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description: Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Pasi,,Janne!Sample_contact_email = pasi_janne@dfci.harvard.edu!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Dana-Farber Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 44 Binney Street Dana 820!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM466nnn/GSM466320/suppl/GSM466320.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18797!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #Signal_A = #VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall#Signal_B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal_A	VALUE	Signal_BSNP_A-1855402	1737.34	B	87.05SNP_A-4249904	1221.73	B	51.02SNP_A-2174835	1798.75	A	65.37SNP_A-1880271	2111.61	B	71.97SNP_A-2313232	3219.96	B	106.65SNP_A-1790918	1744.63	A	97.08SNP_A-1812820	1173.62	A	60.88SNP_A-1825137	4456.34	A	155.06SNP_A-1855057	892	B	83.06SNP_A-1855068	2233.21	A	45.51SNP_A-4249854	1436.8	B	40.36SNP_A-4249855	1509.41	A	94.12SNP_A-1855365	1099.99	B	106.77SNP_A-1856257	2301.65	A	87.01SNP_A-1862900	2211.61	B	87.37SNP_A-1894450	2702.79	B	61.04SNP_A-1900543	2148.83	A	118.67SNP_A-1905760	4124.68	AB	156.83SNP_A-1907304	1239.01	B	27.28SNP_A-1941504	896.87	B	99.28!sample_table_end
