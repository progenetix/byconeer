DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to 250K_Sty!Sample_data_processing = CEL files and TXT files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by dChip and model-based expression performed using the PM/MM model. Normalization was performed using the invariant set probe selection method and the running median smoothing method. The data matrix contains the normalized expression values produced by that algorithm.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description: Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Pasi,,Janne!Sample_contact_email = pasi_janne@dfci.harvard.edu!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Dana-Farber Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 44 Binney Street Dana 820!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM466nnn/GSM466322/suppl/GSM466322.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18797!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #Signal_A = #VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall#Signal_B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal_A	VALUE	Signal_BSNP_A-1855402	1122.27	B	54.64SNP_A-4249904	929.72	B	73.21SNP_A-2174835	1955.94	A	132.61SNP_A-1880271	2168.9	B	108.27SNP_A-2313232	2826.42	B	149.27SNP_A-1790918	1016.94	A	119.33SNP_A-1812820	812.75	A	40.82SNP_A-1825137	3431.65	A	143.14SNP_A-1855057	613.73	B	41.96SNP_A-1855068	1164.58	A	67.36SNP_A-4249854	1097.39	B	67.58SNP_A-4249855	1768.94	A	181.6SNP_A-1855365	1052.32	B	72.69SNP_A-1856257	2249.62	A	140.19SNP_A-1862900	2056.48	B	63.42SNP_A-1894450	2665.4	B	134.09SNP_A-1900543	2340.98	A	131.07SNP_A-1905760	3551.6	A	124.1SNP_A-1907304	723.6	B	57.63SNP_A-1941504	995.9	B	82.26!sample_table_end
