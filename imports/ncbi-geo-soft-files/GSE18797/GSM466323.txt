DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to 250K_Sty!Sample_data_processing = CEL files and TXT files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by dChip and model-based expression performed using the PM/MM model. Normalization was performed using the invariant set probe selection method and the running median smoothing method. The data matrix contains the normalized expression values produced by that algorithm.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description: Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Pasi,,Janne!Sample_contact_email = pasi_janne@dfci.harvard.edu!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Dana-Farber Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 44 Binney Street Dana 820!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM466nnn/GSM466323/suppl/GSM466323.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18797!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #Signal_A = #VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall#Signal_B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal_A	VALUE	Signal_BSNP_A-1855402	1555.86	B	67.05SNP_A-4249904	1087.88	B	73.81SNP_A-2174835	1929.28	A	54.29SNP_A-1880271	2033.78	B	111.39SNP_A-2313232	3253.4	B	135.45SNP_A-1790918	1185.49	A	171.42SNP_A-1812820	1086.99	A	90.14SNP_A-1825137	3423.98	A	75.86SNP_A-1855057	849.22	B	55.6SNP_A-1855068	1601.81	A	63.06SNP_A-4249854	1392.52	B	74.18SNP_A-4249855	1714.77	A	50.15SNP_A-1855365	1015.98	B	115.56SNP_A-1856257	2272.86	A	111.15SNP_A-1862900	2284.75	B	101.19SNP_A-1894450	2733.09	B	131.31SNP_A-1900543	2111.38	A	30.19SNP_A-1905760	3736.77	A	103.63SNP_A-1907304	872.29	B	79.5SNP_A-1941504	893.16	B	42.54!sample_table_end
