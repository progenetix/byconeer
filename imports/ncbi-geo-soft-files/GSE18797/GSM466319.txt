DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to 250K_Sty!Sample_data_processing = CEL files and TXT files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by dChip and model-based expression performed using the PM/MM model. Normalization was performed using the invariant set probe selection method and the running median smoothing method. The data matrix contains the normalized expression values produced by that algorithm.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description: Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Pasi,,Janne!Sample_contact_email = pasi_janne@dfci.harvard.edu!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Dana-Farber Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 44 Binney Street Dana 820!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM466nnn/GSM466319/suppl/GSM466319.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18797!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #Signal_A = #VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall#Signal_B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal_A	VALUE	Signal_BSNP_A-1855402	1454.41	B	126.04SNP_A-4249904	1003.98	B	60.09SNP_A-2174835	1856.82	A	118.94SNP_A-1880271	2038.45	B	90SNP_A-2313232	2900.65	B	100.16SNP_A-1790918	1440.99	A	88.31SNP_A-1812820	945.96	A	48.36SNP_A-1825137	3569.52	A	60.6SNP_A-1855057	795.27	B	54.88SNP_A-1855068	1420.59	A	39.92SNP_A-4249854	829.5	B	48.72SNP_A-4249855	1406.7	A	63.25SNP_A-1855365	1030.3	B	71.88SNP_A-1856257	1836.89	A	131.76SNP_A-1862900	2074.62	B	76.8SNP_A-1894450	2465.23	B	94.8SNP_A-1900543	1869.98	A	103.31SNP_A-1905760	3490.5	AB	47.39SNP_A-1907304	675.56	B	43.19SNP_A-1941504	971.37	B	56.09!sample_table_end
