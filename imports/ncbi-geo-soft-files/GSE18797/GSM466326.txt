DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to 250K_Sty!Sample_data_processing = CEL files and TXT files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by dChip and model-based expression performed using the PM/MM model. Normalization was performed using the invariant set probe selection method and the running median smoothing method. The data matrix contains the normalized expression values produced by that algorithm.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description: Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Pasi,,Janne!Sample_contact_email = pasi_janne@dfci.harvard.edu!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Dana-Farber Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 44 Binney Street Dana 820!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM466nnn/GSM466326/suppl/GSM466326.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18797!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #Signal_A = #VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall#Signal_B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal_A	VALUE	Signal_BSNP_A-1855402	1603.14	B	162.22SNP_A-4249904	948.65	B	114.41SNP_A-2174835	2035.03	A	105.71SNP_A-1880271	2179.22	B	50.31SNP_A-2313232	3122.23	B	49.62SNP_A-1790918	1532.52	A	85.89SNP_A-1812820	1006.79	A	54.05SNP_A-1825137	3405.31	A	139.38SNP_A-1855057	998.96	B	41.42SNP_A-1855068	1874.51	A	141.74SNP_A-4249854	909.72	B	73.14SNP_A-4249855	1324.04	A	64.22SNP_A-1855365	1092.44	B	62.49SNP_A-1856257	1787.98	A	89.18SNP_A-1862900	2329.64	B	157.57SNP_A-1894450	2930.81	B	90.46SNP_A-1900543	2062.34	A	71.64SNP_A-1905760	3267.25	A	97.31SNP_A-1907304	976.17	B	41.9SNP_A-1941504	1096.98	B	71.5!sample_table_end
