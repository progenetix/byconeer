DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to 250K_Sty!Sample_data_processing = CEL files and TXT files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by dChip and model-based expression performed using the PM/MM model. Normalization was performed using the invariant set probe selection method and the running median smoothing method. The data matrix contains the normalized expression values produced by that algorithm.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description: Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Pasi,,Janne!Sample_contact_email = pasi_janne@dfci.harvard.edu!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Dana-Farber Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 44 Binney Street Dana 820!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM466nnn/GSM466327/suppl/GSM466327.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18797!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #Signal_A = #VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall#Signal_B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal_A	VALUE	Signal_BSNP_A-1855402	1677.5	B	110.3SNP_A-4249904	960.37	B	59.18SNP_A-2174835	1930.13	A	133.86SNP_A-1880271	2200.09	B	80.38SNP_A-2313232	3097.3	B	129.73SNP_A-1790918	1450.96	A	52.8SNP_A-1812820	909.69	A	32.86SNP_A-1825137	3624.22	A	134.53SNP_A-1855057	803.25	B	53.76SNP_A-1855068	1776.82	A	102.68SNP_A-4249854	837.74	B	36.99SNP_A-4249855	1408.34	A	78.21SNP_A-1855365	1141.64	B	56.76SNP_A-1856257	1790.98	A	135.26SNP_A-1862900	1842.24	B	103.12SNP_A-1894450	2902.55	B	141.76SNP_A-1900543	2064.07	A	95.01SNP_A-1905760	3212.28	A	87.58SNP_A-1907304	846.75	B	100.11SNP_A-1941504	1163.01	B	33.67!sample_table_end
