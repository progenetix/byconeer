DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to 250K_Sty!Sample_data_processing = CEL files and TXT files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by dChip and model-based expression performed using the PM/MM model. Normalization was performed using the invariant set probe selection method and the running median smoothing method. The data matrix contains the normalized expression values produced by that algorithm.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description: Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Pasi,,Janne!Sample_contact_email = pasi_janne@dfci.harvard.edu!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Dana-Farber Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 44 Binney Street Dana 820!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM466nnn/GSM466330/suppl/GSM466330.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18797!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #Signal_A = #VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall#Signal_B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal_A	VALUE	Signal_BSNP_A-1855402	1648.01	B	117.68SNP_A-4249904	962.04	B	64.48SNP_A-2174835	1769.72	A	79.44SNP_A-1880271	2109.48	B	45.66SNP_A-2313232	2888.52	B	160.02SNP_A-1790918	1270.27	A	80.88SNP_A-1812820	950.42	A	62.97SNP_A-1825137	3715.72	A	185.88SNP_A-1855057	740.9	B	80.54SNP_A-1855068	1914	A	63.99SNP_A-4249854	749.38	B	75.08SNP_A-4249855	1470.49	A	37.57SNP_A-1855365	1133.96	B	70.82SNP_A-1856257	1882.9	A	156.84SNP_A-1862900	2024.34	B	48.26SNP_A-1894450	2740.39	B	116.6SNP_A-1900543	1916.22	A	71.45SNP_A-1905760	3378.6	A	85.64SNP_A-1907304	640.03	B	25.85SNP_A-1941504	1254.9	B	127.39!sample_table_end
