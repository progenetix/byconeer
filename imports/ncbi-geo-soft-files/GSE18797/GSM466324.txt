DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to 250K_Sty!Sample_data_processing = CEL files and TXT files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by dChip and model-based expression performed using the PM/MM model. Normalization was performed using the invariant set probe selection method and the running median smoothing method. The data matrix contains the normalized expression values produced by that algorithm.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description: Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Pasi,,Janne!Sample_contact_email = pasi_janne@dfci.harvard.edu!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Dana-Farber Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 44 Binney Street Dana 820!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM466nnn/GSM466324/suppl/GSM466324.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18797!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #Signal_A = #VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall#Signal_B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal_A	VALUE	Signal_BSNP_A-1855402	1597.8	B	132.08SNP_A-4249904	1345.02	B	99.4SNP_A-2174835	1832.03	A	122.71SNP_A-1880271	2148.45	B	37.35SNP_A-2313232	2938.22	B	116.87SNP_A-1790918	1749.43	A	194.07SNP_A-1812820	994.72	A	54.46SNP_A-1825137	3869.34	A	172.38SNP_A-1855057	807.29	B	52.23SNP_A-1855068	1743.05	A	85.69SNP_A-4249854	1479.35	B	53.28SNP_A-4249855	1551.71	A	65SNP_A-1855365	1168.78	B	93.52SNP_A-1856257	2017.79	A	78.86SNP_A-1862900	2187.13	B	141.03SNP_A-1894450	2660.24	B	119.9SNP_A-1900543	2165.96	A	111.68SNP_A-1905760	3838.65	A	158.13SNP_A-1907304	995.8	B	37.36SNP_A-1941504	1135	B	128.19!sample_table_end
