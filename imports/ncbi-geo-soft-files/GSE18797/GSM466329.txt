DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to 250K_Sty!Sample_data_processing = CEL files and TXT files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by dChip and model-based expression performed using the PM/MM model. Normalization was performed using the invariant set probe selection method and the running median smoothing method. The data matrix contains the normalized expression values produced by that algorithm.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description: Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Pasi,,Janne!Sample_contact_email = pasi_janne@dfci.harvard.edu!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Dana-Farber Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 44 Binney Street Dana 820!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM466nnn/GSM466329/suppl/GSM466329.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18797!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #Signal_A = #VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall#Signal_B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal_A	VALUE	Signal_BSNP_A-1855402	1686.65	B	78.08SNP_A-4249904	1096.1	B	47.7SNP_A-2174835	1988.93	A	101.56SNP_A-1880271	2189.17	B	64.82SNP_A-2313232	2866.84	B	90.77SNP_A-1790918	1490.21	A	88.74SNP_A-1812820	897.46	A	86.66SNP_A-1825137	3496.43	A	73.7SNP_A-1855057	931.59	B	51.83SNP_A-1855068	1710.53	A	94.63SNP_A-4249854	898.27	B	65.46SNP_A-4249855	1560.96	A	48.44SNP_A-1855365	855.41	B	82.12SNP_A-1856257	1657.3	A	127.89SNP_A-1862900	2026.51	B	83.01SNP_A-1894450	2610.95	B	112.8SNP_A-1900543	2135.94	A	79.43SNP_A-1905760	3433.39	A	117.92SNP_A-1907304	792.78	B	44.72SNP_A-1941504	912.67	B	69.27!sample_table_end
