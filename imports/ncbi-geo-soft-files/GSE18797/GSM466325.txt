DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to 250K_Sty!Sample_data_processing = CEL files and TXT files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by dChip and model-based expression performed using the PM/MM model. Normalization was performed using the invariant set probe selection method and the running median smoothing method. The data matrix contains the normalized expression values produced by that algorithm.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description: Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Pasi,,Janne!Sample_contact_email = pasi_janne@dfci.harvard.edu!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Dana-Farber Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 44 Binney Street Dana 820!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM466nnn/GSM466325/suppl/GSM466325.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18797!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #Signal_A = #VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall#Signal_B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal_A	VALUE	Signal_BSNP_A-1855402	934.28	B	71.12SNP_A-4249904	826.21	B	59.01SNP_A-2174835	2113.89	A	111.51SNP_A-1880271	2009.5	B	94.07SNP_A-2313232	3033.39	B	67.74SNP_A-1790918	1048.54	A	93.51SNP_A-1812820	787.54	A	49.94SNP_A-1825137	4141.36	A	72.56SNP_A-1855057	560.22	B	73.89SNP_A-1855068	1434.86	A	44.22SNP_A-4249854	1388.62	B	30.43SNP_A-4249855	1733.42	A	66.24SNP_A-1855365	1094.19	B	47.73SNP_A-1856257	2392.92	A	131.24SNP_A-1862900	2238.97	B	147.41SNP_A-1894450	2881.57	B	120.54SNP_A-1900543	2404.44	A	108.53SNP_A-1905760	4154.68	AB	129.44SNP_A-1907304	688.55	B	56.04SNP_A-1941504	920.18	B	82.4!sample_table_end
