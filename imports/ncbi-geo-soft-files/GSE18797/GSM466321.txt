DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to 250K_Sty!Sample_data_processing = CEL files and TXT files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by dChip and model-based expression performed using the PM/MM model. Normalization was performed using the invariant set probe selection method and the running median smoothing method. The data matrix contains the normalized expression values produced by that algorithm.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description: Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Pasi,,Janne!Sample_contact_email = pasi_janne@dfci.harvard.edu!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Dana-Farber Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 44 Binney Street Dana 820!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM466nnn/GSM466321/suppl/GSM466321.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18797!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #Signal_A = #VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall#Signal_B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal_A	VALUE	Signal_BSNP_A-1855402	1225.79	B	152.73SNP_A-4249904	899.51	B	55.65SNP_A-2174835	1928.86	A	105.21SNP_A-1880271	2152.68	B	109SNP_A-2313232	3046.18	B	140.11SNP_A-1790918	1175.85	A	47.22SNP_A-1812820	856.77	A	60.69SNP_A-1825137	4097.05	A	140.88SNP_A-1855057	717.32	B	42.84SNP_A-1855068	1340.28	A	65.74SNP_A-4249854	1488.23	B	69.42SNP_A-4249855	1420.17	A	64.99SNP_A-1855365	1223.4	B	47SNP_A-1856257	2195.19	A	121.98SNP_A-1862900	2276.56	B	120.86SNP_A-1894450	2721.23	B	100.04SNP_A-1900543	2143.16	A	117.36SNP_A-1905760	3721.89	A	118.51SNP_A-1907304	695.38	B	32.13SNP_A-1941504	1074.54	B	113.65!sample_table_end
