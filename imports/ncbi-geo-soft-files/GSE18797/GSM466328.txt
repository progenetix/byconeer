DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to 250K_Sty!Sample_data_processing = CEL files and TXT files (generated by Affymetrix GTYPE using the DM algorithm) were processed by dChip and model-based expression performed using the PM/MM model. Normalization was performed using the invariant set probe selection method and the running median smoothing method. The data matrix contains the normalized expression values produced by that algorithm.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description: Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Pasi,,Janne!Sample_contact_email = pasi_janne@dfci.harvard.edu!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Dana-Farber Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 44 Binney Street Dana 820!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM466nnn/GSM466328/suppl/GSM466328.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE18797!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #Signal_A = #VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): A, AB, B, and NoCall#Signal_B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	Signal_A	VALUE	Signal_BSNP_A-1855402	1636.32	B	110.72SNP_A-4249904	1046.45	B	55.38SNP_A-2174835	1978.62	A	136.9SNP_A-1880271	2407.41	B	72.9SNP_A-2313232	3181.99	B	119.73SNP_A-1790918	1412.38	A	163.06SNP_A-1812820	894.68	A	38.22SNP_A-1825137	3593.63	A	312.02SNP_A-1855057	811.77	B	20.22SNP_A-1855068	1902.98	A	85.84SNP_A-4249854	1086.79	B	68.5SNP_A-4249855	1626.1	A	138.99SNP_A-1855365	1086.31	B	62.26SNP_A-1856257	1852.37	A	93.92SNP_A-1862900	2030.28	B	77.9SNP_A-1894450	2699.32	B	109.33SNP_A-1900543	2195.51	A	171.91SNP_A-1905760	3635.66	A	251.37SNP_A-1907304	944.67	B	36.97SNP_A-1941504	1199.85	B	76.55!sample_table_end
