To identify regions of similar genomic status within the array-CGH data, we applied the segmentation software GLAD. Imbalances with log2 ratios of less than -1.0 were scored as putative homozygous deletions, because this threshold corresponds to an average copy number of less than 1, suggesting the presence of at least one subpopulation of cells with homozygous deletions. Gains with log2 ratios higher than 1.0 were scored as amplifications.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8175!Sample_contact_name = Aurelie,,Ernst!Sample_contact_institute = DKFZ!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM371nnn/GSM371093/suppl/GSM371093_309978.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14822!Sample_series_id = GSE14824!Sample_data_row_count = 7733#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (glioblastoma/reference DNA)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEG007563	-0.220532027G007109	-0.000822926G007107	0.129320147G007641	-0.287390359G000001	-0.051298006G003128	0.008127115G007091	0.256913944G003295	0.060849204G007108	-0.055503117G007087	0.042566571G007105	-0.027580042G004205	0.005583074G008027	-0.193658976G006935	-0.12049522G003545	-0.003830924G004383	-0.062889296G007635	0.21425675G007004	0.004440979G004055	-0.011761454G004626	-0.045117861!sample_table_end
