To identify regions of similar genomic status within the array-CGH data, we applied the segmentation software GLAD. Imbalances with log2 ratios of less than -1.0 were scored as putative homozygous deletions, because this threshold corresponds to an average copy number of less than 1, suggesting the presence of at least one subpopulation of cells with homozygous deletions. Gains with log2 ratios higher than 1.0 were scored as amplifications.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8175!Sample_contact_name = Aurelie,,Ernst!Sample_contact_institute = DKFZ!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM371nnn/GSM371088/suppl/GSM371088_167539.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14822!Sample_series_id = GSE14824!Sample_data_row_count = 7733#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (glioblastoma/reference DNA)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEG007563	-0.117894736G007109	0.063844218G007107	0.131907422G007641	0.003894012G000001	-0.004915696G003128	0.044528576G007091	0.424834493G003295	-0.020852275G007108	-0.081352531G007087	-0.054724856G007105	0.049007274G004205	-0.009716507G008027	-0.297967115G006935	-0.143729457G003545	-0.103470215G004383	-0.607512799G007635	-0.229179407G007004	-0.22229424G004055	-0.562258868G004626	-0.335044253!sample_table_end
