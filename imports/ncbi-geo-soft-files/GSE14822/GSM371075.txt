To identify regions of similar genomic status within the array-CGH data, we applied the segmentation software GLAD. Imbalances with log2 ratios of less than -1.0 were scored as putative homozygous deletions, because this threshold corresponds to an average copy number of less than 1, suggesting the presence of at least one subpopulation of cells with homozygous deletions. Gains with log2 ratios higher than 1.0 were scored as amplifications.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8175!Sample_contact_name = Aurelie,,Ernst!Sample_contact_institute = DKFZ!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM371nnn/GSM371075/suppl/GSM371075_167540.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14822!Sample_series_id = GSE14824!Sample_data_row_count = 7733#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (glioblastoma/reference DNA)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEG007563	-0.104255905G007109	-0.164821137G007107	0.266122267G007641	-0.082068847G000001	-0.041140538G003128	-0.066199203G007091	0.203943205G003295	0.248411639G007108	0.076306034G007087	0.039024676G007105	0.126321609G004205	0.297619508G008027	0.035786926G006935	-0.046470423G003545	0.100947489G004383	0.160936427G007635	-0.19561165G007004	0.215548471G004055	-0.02541205G004626	0.289415439!sample_table_end
