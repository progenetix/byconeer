To identify regions of similar genomic status within the array-CGH data, we applied the segmentation software GLAD. Imbalances with log2 ratios of less than -1.0 were scored as putative homozygous deletions, because this threshold corresponds to an average copy number of less than 1, suggesting the presence of at least one subpopulation of cells with homozygous deletions. Gains with log2 ratios higher than 1.0 were scored as amplifications.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8175!Sample_contact_name = Aurelie,,Ernst!Sample_contact_institute = DKFZ!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM371nnn/GSM371089/suppl/GSM371089_167518.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14822!Sample_series_id = GSE14824!Sample_data_row_count = 7733#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (glioblastoma/reference DNA)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEG007563	-0.042631887G007109	0.168379213G007107	0.46444186G007641	0.027775144G000001	-0.014619196G003128	-0.027854858G007091	0.545271837G003295	0.046774842G007108	-0.019159437G007087	-0.037607088G007105	0.037407251G004205	0.159934019G008027	0.011251587G006935	0.026541274G003545	0.036442711G004383	0.048336332G007635	0.13970607G007004	0.029679034G004055	-0.021487314G004626	0.045167938!sample_table_end
