To identify regions of similar genomic status within the array-CGH data, we applied the segmentation software GLAD. Imbalances with log2 ratios of less than -1.0 were scored as putative homozygous deletions, because this threshold corresponds to an average copy number of less than 1, suggesting the presence of at least one subpopulation of cells with homozygous deletions. Gains with log2 ratios higher than 1.0 were scored as amplifications.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8175!Sample_contact_name = Aurelie,,Ernst!Sample_contact_institute = DKFZ!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM371nnn/GSM371091/suppl/GSM371091_167915.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14822!Sample_series_id = GSE14824!Sample_data_row_count = 7733#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (glioblastoma/reference DNA)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEG007563	0.121740084G007109	0.181856111G007107	0.426760199G007641	0.009714839G000001	0.002160521G003128	-0.008442615G007091	0.058635506G003295	0.03230306G007108	-0.046148052G007087	-0.070640517G007105	0.015970499G004205	0.174174104G008027	-0.003051149G006935	-0.011978258G003545	0.068234307G004383	0.104122452G007635	-0.057452288G007004	0.018452638G004055	0.010508526G004626	0.113841843!sample_table_end
