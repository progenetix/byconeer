Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805444/suppl/GSM805444.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805444/suppl/GSM805444.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.007505	AB	1619.452881	1955.227173SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.319194	BB	357.877899	412.827179SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004299	BB	1413.818604	5433.786133SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.003784	AB	1731.315186	970.989258SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.006975	AA	928.869629	261.999237SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.004936	AB	1897.771729	1227.750366SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.004573	BB	354.117767	1600.841675SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.003149	AA	3413.713867	780.075806SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.001587	AA	2398.267090	437.703766SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.000305	AB	1535.009399	1237.407104SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.003067	AB	1381.107056	2023.366699SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.009815	BB	454.206146	2240.933594SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.002074	AA	1446.707153	253.681870SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.008969	AA	2376.468994	651.602356SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.007789	AB	510.379944	495.100525SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.004229	AA	1988.640869	726.180847SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.013124	AA	4291.809082	778.696289SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.007043	AA	1263.655640	331.545074SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.008970	AA	3382.401855	880.000061SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.000534	AA	1779.112793	309.113617!sample_table_end
