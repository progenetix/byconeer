Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805481/suppl/GSM805481.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805481/suppl/GSM805481.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.056856	AB	2008.823120	1273.479492SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.151014	BB	243.142731	699.844421SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004452	BB	1034.609253	3639.578857SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.015446	AB	1128.307129	1172.921143SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.006219	AA	1002.877441	292.116211SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.001832	AA	2354.591797	429.410980SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.002304	BB	262.497131	1346.422729SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.001941	AA	2687.586182	712.200012SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.012868	AB	918.846375	1500.603394SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.022691	AB	960.125000	1202.553223SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.010875	AB	858.929565	1554.176025SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.008016	BB	583.757874	2227.364746SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.018831	AA	904.922974	214.447906SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.001959	AA	1740.434326	428.433441SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.092060	AB	544.128235	777.859192SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.004718	AA	1865.380981	753.474609SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.020888	AB	2762.602783	1718.080200SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.012006	AA	1049.599243	240.955597SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.005370	AA	3613.539551	906.820190SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.015060	AB	563.894531	1007.633362!sample_table_end
