Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805485/suppl/GSM805485.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805485/suppl/GSM805485.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.010048	BB	566.064087	2919.081055SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.175108	BB	255.199615	619.914429SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.000259	BB	1297.190918	4400.904297SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.005258	AB	1473.125977	939.960022SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.006512	AA	943.152405	259.554169SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.001774	AA	2601.214111	417.908417SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.010083	BB	305.266541	1716.709717SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.002253	AA	2855.876221	878.513367SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.002237	AB	1383.793213	1421.154297SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.003659	AA	2069.258789	473.474823SNP_A-1995893	AA	0.002195	AA	2546.691650	976.330994SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.007613	BB	647.842529	2339.511230SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.001445	AA	1496.602539	243.655991SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.002746	AA	2051.261475	519.597534SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.004394	AA	912.344971	240.035767SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.003785	AA	2016.410645	801.838257SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.007921	AA	3756.403564	446.970245SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.002588	AA	1443.758789	287.409058SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.006059	AA	3685.754883	797.737244SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.004335	AA	2007.885742	287.409058!sample_table_end
