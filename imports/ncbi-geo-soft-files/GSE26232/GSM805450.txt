Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805450/suppl/GSM805450.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805450/suppl/GSM805450.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.024350	AA	1893.316040	492.934570SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.148817	BB	278.349884	732.771790SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.007181	BB	1017.191895	2976.153076SNP_A-4263484	NC	0.311403	AB	1950.485352	445.343842SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.012658	AA	742.296387	249.565231SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.010071	AA	1749.767090	343.529663SNP_A-1980898	AA	0.058878	AA	1203.824707	370.763824SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.009778	AA	1926.632812	588.373840SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.011461	AA	1601.927856	438.310272SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.001780	BB	540.610474	1842.154053SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.028892	BB	503.145172	1968.119507SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.009443	BB	621.314819	2142.759521SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.069948	AA	770.817383	233.302917SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.011997	AA	1278.737305	640.281128SNP_A-1997922	NC	0.551610	AB	526.768250	827.816223SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.086024	AB	447.370300	1885.348389SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.010402	BB	1261.037964	3062.247803SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.050571	AA	864.900696	327.277466SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.080827	AA	3092.245850	1091.977539SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.004448	AA	1355.822876	263.967834!sample_table_end
