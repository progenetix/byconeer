Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805438/suppl/GSM805438.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805438/suppl/GSM805438.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.008077	BB	705.133118	3206.405762SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.251929	BB	274.455383	455.702057SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.007539	BB	1053.230713	2933.486084SNP_A-4263484	NC	0.316982	AB	2223.948486	687.544250SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.007532	AA	966.466309	298.378296SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.006391	AA	1898.820801	348.503448SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.079295	BB	457.094727	965.130737SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.004468	AA	2708.348389	900.807312SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.003062	AA	2038.045288	502.493134SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.000658	BB	534.208862	2103.242676SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.003810	BB	469.164642	2436.240723SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.007912	BB	592.654053	2243.215332SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.012465	AA	938.437317	191.740875SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.047459	AB	754.050842	1901.479126SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.043898	AB	632.738037	316.310822SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.007319	AA	1644.861206	814.812927SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.029264	AA	3189.226074	1456.051270SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.009932	AA	1164.841309	322.458130SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.523528	AA	2849.152344	902.901917SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.002440	AA	1513.684937	306.344727!sample_table_end
