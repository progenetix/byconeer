Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805455/suppl/GSM805455.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805455/suppl/GSM805455.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.006513	AB	1837.494385	2799.918701SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.130133	BB	263.173218	821.635254SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001736	BB	1183.417969	4037.887695SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.007460	AB	1496.023071	1436.354736SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.004398	AA	1073.500732	287.311005SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.003990	AB	1188.104614	1218.118408SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.007317	AB	918.215271	1097.194458SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.018374	AA	1636.555542	524.266785SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.005767	AB	1601.801147	1225.340454SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.005412	AB	1250.592896	1306.956299SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.006969	AB	1196.683960	2057.710449SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.003485	BB	610.870544	2981.177002SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.002348	AA	1449.798340	268.962524SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.026204	AB	893.865906	1979.821167SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.004942	AA	884.958374	223.164780SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.003426	AA	2079.572021	826.105896SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.003715	AA	3689.311035	631.390015SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.004469	AA	1367.665405	325.592804SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.007978	AA	3444.005615	868.689697SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.010983	AB	738.241943	1150.877197!sample_table_end
