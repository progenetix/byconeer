Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805483/suppl/GSM805483.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805483/suppl/GSM805483.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.007014	BB	642.780090	3228.883057SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.140969	BB	306.863007	791.553345SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.000983	BB	1370.402588	4801.713379SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.008594	AB	2060.225586	943.080994SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.003016	AA	1122.915649	248.834152SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.008568	AA	2969.738770	372.696869SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.011024	AB	847.687195	1132.986084SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.000535	AA	3041.513672	839.425049SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.002598	AA	2047.968750	453.598053SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.006264	AB	1155.843140	1228.681396SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.005150	AB	1178.439819	1845.153076SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.005032	BB	566.987061	2715.986084SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.005384	AA	1199.169922	232.596527SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.001046	AA	1618.521484	478.621887SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.050939	AB	504.499664	706.251465SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.002269	AA	2419.010254	895.889282SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.005033	AB	2117.924316	2741.465332SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.002970	AA	1515.384644	229.841187SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.002292	AA	3879.399902	993.703491SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.002173	AA	1505.142212	265.083130!sample_table_end
