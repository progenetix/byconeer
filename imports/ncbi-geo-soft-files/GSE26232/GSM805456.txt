Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805456/suppl/GSM805456.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805456/suppl/GSM805456.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.009733	BB	709.902893	3103.978516SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.129867	BB	248.157440	812.699463SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.003565	BB	1566.044067	5179.696777SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.017552	AB	1205.601929	1405.188477SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.003577	AA	1075.311768	231.053726SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.043110	AB	1156.050659	1674.611572SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.011571	BB	309.446472	1756.982178SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.002851	AA	3181.998535	704.068298SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.000820	AA	2508.760010	526.044434SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.000700	BB	541.075562	2143.713379SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.005391	BB	447.737671	2299.192627SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.008875	BB	569.711365	2135.938721SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.005666	AA	1156.050659	214.165741SNP_A-1997896	BB	0.004197	BB	707.381897	3036.612793SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.035368	AA	780.740662	246.359680SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.004561	AA	1897.815430	733.678711SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.015097	AA	4315.604492	660.421387SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.005426	AA	1352.518921	207.529968SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.001871	AA	4002.245117	946.346436SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.002856	AA	1870.317627	263.847748!sample_table_end
