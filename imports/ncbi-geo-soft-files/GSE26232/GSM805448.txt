Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805448/suppl/GSM805448.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805448/suppl/GSM805448.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.002386	AB	2316.125244	2523.283936SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.132727	BB	278.326447	816.469299SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.005608	BB	1231.070312	5077.603027SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.001471	BB	523.119507	2086.227295SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.010555	AA	950.661682	337.510620SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.009126	AA	2946.563965	344.618317SNP_A-1980898	AA	0.013559	AA	2017.697632	272.912292SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.005875	AA	3653.202393	774.623474SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.004092	AA	2785.569824	490.236755SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.001669	BB	538.233887	2299.493408SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.001908	BB	437.544189	2612.536621SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.006409	BB	628.404236	3879.122559SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.006254	AA	1176.686401	240.614349SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.011013	AA	2457.255371	495.242798SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.001458	BB	423.726959	1124.962402SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.002191	AA	2351.838867	910.491638SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.002095	BB	1240.412476	4596.052246SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.001605	AA	1560.247192	262.172363SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.008498	AA	4654.818848	813.398132SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.002454	AB	1021.060547	1133.171631!sample_table_end
