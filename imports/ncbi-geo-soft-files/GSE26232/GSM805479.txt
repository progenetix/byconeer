Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805479/suppl/GSM805479.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805479/suppl/GSM805479.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.027253	BB	2304.187744	7463.457031SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.527647	AB	3401.352295	3076.941162SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.014213	AB	3614.131348	6461.870117SNP_A-4263484	AA	0.032107	AA	4754.032227	1617.605835SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.001326	AB	819.182678	1309.454590SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.050370	AB	2574.078857	2234.806641SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.002450	BB	346.346222	1493.432495SNP_A-1983139	AB	0.043334	AB	6044.838379	3421.877686SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.026312	AA	3429.270508	1476.252930SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.066202	BB	2471.644775	5003.337891SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.036890	BB	1843.799805	4561.802734SNP_A-1997689	NC	0.117929	BB	1600.333740	4017.305664SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.072220	AB	2307.116943	2557.299316SNP_A-1997896	NC	0.119719	AA	3670.571777	1125.399048SNP_A-1997922	NC	0.128209	AB	2308.011475	2227.860596SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.009101	AB	1224.509766	1379.192505SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.061907	BB	1262.698730	2384.010742SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.014835	AA	1075.064087	322.712372SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.008253	AB	2189.083252	1117.908203SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.024906	AA	925.644348	231.239960!sample_table_end
