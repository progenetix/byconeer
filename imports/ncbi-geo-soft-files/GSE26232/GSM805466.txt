Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805466/suppl/GSM805466.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805466/suppl/GSM805466.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.007052	AB	2365.139160	1938.473022SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.270676	BB	625.963196	718.987244SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.003996	BB	1572.007568	5414.236816SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.011216	AB	1751.456909	1885.519897SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.008914	AB	1005.150879	1158.387817SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.014872	AB	2070.934570	989.213623SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.006208	BB	401.537720	1681.969116SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.006516	AA	4223.234863	1065.278931SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.001913	AA	2146.925049	495.483276SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.001347	BB	564.083740	2304.782715SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.005505	BB	390.101044	2245.216309SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.002445	BB	648.991394	3272.705322SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.008318	AA	1264.303711	317.494324SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.001925	AA	1946.442627	485.945435SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.029954	BB	598.714539	1052.212036SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.002329	AA	2447.697021	893.243469SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.004245	BB	1121.694580	4743.802246SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.001471	AA	1839.090942	314.134827SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.001958	AA	4095.052734	1177.286011SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.007846	AB	1342.893555	896.570496!sample_table_end
