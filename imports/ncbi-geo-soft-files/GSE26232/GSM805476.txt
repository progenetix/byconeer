Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805476/suppl/GSM805476.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805476/suppl/GSM805476.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.003244	BB	589.966064	3728.843994SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.201034	BB	281.393463	564.759216SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001845	BB	1360.274292	4961.282715SNP_A-4263484	AA	0.006197	AA	2678.899170	446.990082SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.005490	AA	980.531067	255.210770SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.002745	AA	2438.218262	301.813568SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.008245	BB	292.338318	1649.579590SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.002333	AA	3239.518066	750.610413SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.000518	AA	2445.429443	522.728882SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.000798	BB	533.143921	2144.625244SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.004280	BB	353.680756	2320.800781SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.009016	BB	462.494934	2774.761719SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.006205	AA	1245.847412	275.996063SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.010580	AA	2345.940430	432.801392SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.003587	BB	334.240265	1049.167236SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.007828	AB	1316.830566	1467.791626SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.009135	BB	912.502258	4705.366699SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.002168	AB	946.968384	1200.893311SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.002092	AA	4298.807129	944.744202SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.000340	AA	1744.454590	303.190155!sample_table_end
