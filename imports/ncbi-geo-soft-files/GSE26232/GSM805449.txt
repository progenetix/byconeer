Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805449/suppl/GSM805449.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805449/suppl/GSM805449.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.003922	BB	765.664490	3721.587402SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.142082	BB	252.069031	746.556335SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001811	BB	1211.872925	4422.845703SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.004157	BB	547.472290	1759.116943SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.005384	AA	1053.869385	303.023285SNP_A-4264431	BB	0.000690	BB	474.749908	1866.257202SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.006519	AB	770.198730	943.416260SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.001177	AA	2892.417480	811.267883SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.376545	AA	1858.965332	915.203125SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.026014	AB	1718.864746	830.209595SNP_A-1995893	AA	0.015158	AA	1885.987183	1193.883545SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.004466	BB	644.101135	2684.130615SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.004434	AA	1343.187012	284.173553SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.004918	AA	2007.058105	412.354095SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.007696	AB	831.145996	520.975464SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.002960	AA	2161.858398	900.056580SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.023668	AB	2168.085693	3660.496582SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.004959	AA	1301.272217	282.849945SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.003024	AA	3814.777100	953.673889SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.025894	AB	1436.411499	720.347290!sample_table_end
