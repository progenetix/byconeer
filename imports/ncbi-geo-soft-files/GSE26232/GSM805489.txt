Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805489/suppl/GSM805489.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805489/suppl/GSM805489.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.008064	BB	913.991516	3494.589111SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.144868	BB	368.921692	823.448975SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004686	BB	1023.872986	3652.825928SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.006926	BB	576.174683	1607.427490SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.001281	AA	1310.354736	292.771240SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.003003	AA	2187.882812	289.809052SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.001221	AB	1052.378784	885.040100SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.003131	AA	2595.973877	774.647949SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.005653	AB	1100.211060	1124.665283SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.017678	AA	1762.712158	449.432922SNP_A-1995893	AA	0.003335	AA	2126.643066	910.253479SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.003093	BB	751.787048	3052.280762SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.002164	AA	1485.096191	279.503571SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.002356	AA	1499.074341	444.055389SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.001674	AA	1108.159424	324.238464SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.000338	AB	1548.344238	2103.894287SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.007830	BB	1116.330200	3241.101807SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.006458	AA	1255.068481	309.075714SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.008048	AA	3421.124023	956.782959SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.005225	AB	841.578491	743.158203!sample_table_end
