Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805490/suppl/GSM805490.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805490/suppl/GSM805490.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.003717	AB	2209.052002	3015.389160SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.006487	BB	218.659378	872.708374SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.003010	BB	1608.459839	4802.524414SNP_A-4263484	AA	0.000563	AA	3214.416504	422.840912SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.003534	AB	652.181519	875.729919SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.001594	AA	2354.880615	422.840912SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.002774	BB	284.985321	1086.401123SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.007164	AA	4103.404297	1288.545532SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.000888	AA	2598.968262	592.585144SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.018408	BB	682.994629	3604.604736SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.000303	BB	597.459961	3099.928467SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.004024	BB	721.450256	2937.581787SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.007861	AA	997.948059	217.224762SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.013825	AB	1057.570190	1218.161133SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.005163	AB	647.468506	660.237488SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.005697	AA	1766.301392	856.075256SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.003288	BB	1444.868530	4171.645996SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.003900	AA	1371.089478	254.251251SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.003264	AA	3851.044189	1159.562622SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.008171	AB	801.953186	650.552307!sample_table_end
