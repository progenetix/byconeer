Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805452/suppl/GSM805452.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805452/suppl/GSM805452.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.081108	BB	1076.027466	8668.353516SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.684369	BB	1303.276489	1346.773926SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.016881	BB	1898.699219	5563.180664SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.039795	AB	3055.234131	2842.351807SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.003315	AA	1384.023926	413.426483SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.008103	AA	2843.549316	315.196564SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.002707	BB	347.804565	1508.570679SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.009442	AA	4661.888672	1254.463989SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.017178	AA	3586.767334	642.789307SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.051779	AB	3140.970459	3119.810791SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.014569	AB	2747.766113	2755.149902SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.008899	BB	1035.832520	5206.337402SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.012783	AA	2689.932373	384.621857SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.004651	AA	2178.443115	588.591797SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.010204	AB	1139.047974	1234.360840SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.002451	AB	1719.917358	2038.107178SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.003478	AB	2211.657471	2734.781006SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.005574	AA	1358.668945	349.824402SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.002526	AA	3900.617920	1109.722168SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.006651	AA	1226.864502	206.093719!sample_table_end
