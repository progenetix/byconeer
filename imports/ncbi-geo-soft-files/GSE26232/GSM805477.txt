Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805477/suppl/GSM805477.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805477/suppl/GSM805477.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.002677	AB	2227.911621	2793.488770SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.132854	BB	290.900116	825.315186SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.002734	BB	1120.505005	3918.650146SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.001918	AB	2066.624023	1335.094727SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.001474	AA	1347.088379	351.939453SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.003255	AA	2370.497070	282.185577SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.007606	BB	316.303314	1665.958008SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.000816	AA	3254.324707	847.865662SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.003175	AA	1968.962280	382.643433SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.001666	BB	446.818298	1810.212646SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.006367	BB	397.558197	2195.174316SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.005881	BB	756.287231	4431.230957SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.001873	AA	1433.119873	195.362732SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.001236	AB	1130.448120	1760.619873SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.000819	AB	976.688599	870.536316SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.001577	AA	2454.127441	1001.026367SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.004125	AA	3850.230713	912.090942SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.002023	AA	1499.193237	307.871429SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.014106	AA	5228.369629	1060.669800SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.000493	AA	1692.596924	321.078491!sample_table_end
