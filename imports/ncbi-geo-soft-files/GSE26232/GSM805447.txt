Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805447/suppl/GSM805447.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805447/suppl/GSM805447.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.007958	AA	4398.899902	1002.566162SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.156065	BB	355.104370	1745.763794SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.017875	AB	2503.838623	6763.876953SNP_A-4263484	AA	0.003641	AA	3767.915527	581.082520SNP_A-1978185	BB	0.005981	BB	993.627441	2922.324219SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.025450	AB	2309.661621	1971.952271SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.087798	AB	2026.550293	1915.871704SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.014461	AA	5165.077148	1687.750122SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.013192	AA	3636.028809	846.637024SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.038781	BB	807.038208	4123.903809SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.005577	BB	656.634155	3619.349609SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.005450	BB	944.334656	3670.338379SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.001501	AA	2007.163574	349.689270SNP_A-1997896	BB	0.005879	BB	954.833435	3102.881104SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.040182	BB	567.128540	1792.728149SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.009783	AA	1650.463257	938.294128SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.012532	AB	1923.529175	1902.853760SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.003194	AA	1432.178589	319.109924SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.066508	AB	2547.426514	827.585571SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.001651	AB	1214.008545	1051.534912!sample_table_end
