Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805464/suppl/GSM805464.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805464/suppl/GSM805464.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.017742	BB	933.086304	6616.627441SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.659817	BB	1045.151367	842.570984SNP_A-1969580	NC	0.323195	BB	2181.611572	6249.863770SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.017147	BB	1082.808594	3529.808594SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.010792	AA	898.573364	313.665741SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.006847	AB	1984.564575	1540.575684SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.005949	AB	1276.011230	933.399902SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.020145	AA	5411.677734	1464.468384SNP_A-4265735	BB	0.010358	BB	1098.749756	3906.600342SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.082723	AA	4579.958984	597.786133SNP_A-1995893	AA	0.061054	AA	5165.194336	1654.286133SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.003793	BB	871.857666	3454.602051SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.022761	AA	3131.001709	486.324615SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.001672	AA	1563.119385	500.523438SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.002266	AA	1015.867310	285.007385SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.004827	AA	1870.122314	817.525696SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.006213	AB	2750.492676	3038.392578SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.002125	AA	1852.844849	349.239166SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.001138	AA	4129.362305	1134.731079SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.006930	AB	725.134583	730.742371!sample_table_end
