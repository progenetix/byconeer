Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805437/suppl/GSM805437.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805437/suppl/GSM805437.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.001383	AB	2450.214844	2848.156494SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.148314	BB	279.941498	736.134033SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001249	BB	1397.150269	4885.187988SNP_A-4263484	AA	0.002782	AA	3555.062744	449.037323SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.004671	AB	624.808472	865.258972SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.003715	AB	1359.330933	966.708191SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.000958	BB	281.884918	1222.366943SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.012258	AA	4987.187500	1419.565796SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.001240	AA	2519.477295	502.390320SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.006237	BB	564.430176	2757.954834SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.001537	BB	578.984375	3188.494385SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.003664	BB	671.464722	2820.391113SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.005622	AA	1247.899658	265.028168SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.001725	AA	1674.203247	432.371338SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.045429	BB	444.472260	870.651978SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.002426	AA	2346.164307	878.839233SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.018058	BB	1680.721924	5367.401855SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.000848	AA	1640.745483	321.995728SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.001960	AA	4448.836426	1033.235229SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.005374	AB	752.797363	892.235657!sample_table_end
