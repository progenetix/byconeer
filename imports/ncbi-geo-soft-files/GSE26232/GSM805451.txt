Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805451/suppl/GSM805451.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805451/suppl/GSM805451.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.003702	BB	664.778015	4939.359375SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.133950	BB	299.537720	825.403687SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.003961	BB	1362.635864	5282.056641SNP_A-4263484	AA	0.001128	AA	3207.106445	402.524567SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.007601	AA	872.206360	236.741791SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.004469	AA	2764.532227	366.678040SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.021907	BB	326.772278	1958.164307SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.001664	AA	3419.310303	864.937195SNP_A-4265735	BB	0.002107	BB	640.157227	2488.205811SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.004869	AB	1944.547852	1791.045532SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.000781	AB	1836.544067	2182.121826SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.002993	BB	652.127808	2945.354492SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.001205	AA	1587.098511	286.657806SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.006839	AA	2296.659912	508.396240SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.009905	AB	685.907166	842.055176SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.003934	AA	2032.636841	750.782227SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.009853	AA	4127.480957	684.647278SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.002902	AA	1465.333252	326.772278SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.002307	AA	4431.230957	1210.055420SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.003478	AA	2019.895020	326.772278!sample_table_end
