Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805453/suppl/GSM805453.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805453/suppl/GSM805453.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.061810	AB	5123.130371	6753.444824SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.233887	BB	434.236053	2006.335083SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.012576	AB	2955.634033	7795.266113SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.028901	BB	1227.084717	3878.002197SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.007776	AA	900.158142	261.892731SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.005948	AA	2465.782715	525.973267SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.011355	AB	702.635132	1002.877441SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.030106	AA	5492.699707	2125.132812SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.007223	AA	3297.361084	773.035034SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.077682	BB	1291.536865	5282.910156SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.081435	BB	1240.023560	5752.482910SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.005352	BB	999.850586	4179.007324SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.002689	AA	2039.536621	304.352539SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.012795	AA	2559.477539	645.929565SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.008854	BB	723.871826	1534.702881SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.004430	AA	1912.380859	798.991455SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.000958	AA	3501.860596	753.097778SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.001686	AA	1649.970215	251.518845SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.015786	AA	3300.687500	1140.413330SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.007769	AA	1209.351074	260.575897!sample_table_end
