Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805439/suppl/GSM805439.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805439/suppl/GSM805439.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.001557	AA	2851.275635	527.753723SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.166095	BB	254.211807	649.033630SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.003272	BB	1520.448853	5339.075195SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.002821	BB	553.852600	1875.855591SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.004046	AB	598.332947	873.174988SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.001343	AA	2337.313721	411.191742SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.001706	BB	333.947723	1441.976074SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.002034	AA	3385.028809	826.057129SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.002347	AA	2080.096191	463.667572SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.000949	BB	508.403229	2104.671387SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.004019	BB	378.435455	2355.869385SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.006594	BB	547.055664	2435.216797SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.007475	AA	1109.731079	226.798508SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.008691	AA	2410.168701	549.820496SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.013716	BB	334.662933	830.028687SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.017404	AB	475.277313	1724.577026SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.005013	BB	992.680542	3888.050049SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.005808	AB	1039.907959	834.323608SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.004332	AB	2728.703125	1578.206665SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.001471	AA	1631.285400	334.950378!sample_table_end
