Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805446/suppl/GSM805446.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805446/suppl/GSM805446.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.015056	AB	1200.178345	2172.025635SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.171154	BB	246.801926	627.317200SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001578	BB	1323.032959	4147.333496SNP_A-4263484	AA	0.028835	AA	2199.030273	382.466797SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.003449	AB	555.325989	886.960938SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.009354	AB	969.274902	1234.573975SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.000436	BB	328.999512	1299.492310SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.004742	AA	2192.929199	527.394775SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.076708	AA	1422.165894	509.153137SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.006496	AB	1937.369629	1189.713745SNP_A-1995893	AA	0.020879	AA	1624.946167	1025.373169SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.010884	BB	541.050049	1943.593872SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.006430	AA	1258.274048	286.288361SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.003237	AA	1413.286377	446.401276SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.012601	AB	449.589417	335.022705SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.067873	AA	1153.362061	834.205383SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.093874	AB	2400.533203	1387.915283SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.009895	AB	970.894470	691.465637SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.008888	AB	2101.251953	1165.701050SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.015315	AB	511.477417	913.197327!sample_table_end
