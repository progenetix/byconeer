Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805445/suppl/GSM805445.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805445/suppl/GSM805445.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.002414	BB	674.671753	4716.948242SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.244557	AA	937.690918	223.343567SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.002824	BB	1170.332642	4426.227539SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.002436	BB	669.328430	2581.032227SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.002819	AA	1153.943848	279.819183SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.002920	AA	2626.520752	348.078308SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.000470	BB	307.315765	1326.518311SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.001038	AA	3475.857666	953.247620SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.001888	AA	2138.481934	473.495209SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.001981	AA	2019.991089	288.918823SNP_A-1995893	AA	0.002218	AA	2610.991943	994.091675SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.005882	BB	553.407166	3235.780273SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.004412	AA	2125.844971	288.936798SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.003354	AA	1569.742920	387.543762SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.002417	AA	1148.561035	238.423798SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.001576	AA	2464.460938	988.474243SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.005840	AB	2880.950195	2588.571045SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.003903	AA	1362.562256	293.561401SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.004581	AA	4660.463379	993.298157SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.000296	AA	1720.760254	299.663605!sample_table_end
