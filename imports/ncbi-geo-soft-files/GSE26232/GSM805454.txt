Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805454/suppl/GSM805454.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805454/suppl/GSM805454.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.001449	BB	1092.554321	5121.424316SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.108718	BB	297.967377	1080.095459SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.019005	BB	1978.754517	6272.694336SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.001893	BB	795.022400	2471.727539SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.000619	AA	1395.809448	322.337585SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.016321	AB	2192.795654	1809.132080SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.015999	BB	457.564606	1957.139282SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.001957	AA	3196.315674	1016.092041SNP_A-4265735	BB	0.001914	BB	896.869995	3181.850098SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.023235	AB	2868.729736	2498.025635SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.016263	AB	2803.691895	2927.740234SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.009418	BB	858.706909	2856.434326SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.001171	AA	1820.349731	271.066162SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.002462	AB	1240.446655	1733.922363SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.005536	AA	985.760681	310.023163SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.001120	AA	2626.797119	1034.356812SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.004809	BB	1476.686157	4646.762695SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.001084	AA	1722.515381	336.184021SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.006712	AA	3805.921875	1284.002075SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.002346	AA	1961.732178	340.777618!sample_table_end
