Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805469/suppl/GSM805469.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805469/suppl/GSM805469.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.004984	AB	3457.457764	3066.829590SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.115453	BB	311.443970	989.621948SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.002625	BB	1280.028809	4864.831055SNP_A-4263484	AA	0.007458	AA	3964.078369	525.799438SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.000705	AA	1377.776001	319.994171SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.001526	AA	2359.095215	421.694275SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.002941	BB	277.296753	1424.190552SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.006923	AA	4275.479980	1080.898193SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.001363	AA	2680.481689	598.780640SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.010540	AB	1768.810181	1931.049683SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.004072	AB	1624.300659	2370.636719SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.001486	BB	866.933167	3996.955078SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.002466	AA	1969.439331	281.606750SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.012422	AB	969.487000	1973.855713SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.002382	AB	740.591797	749.233887SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.000534	AA	2815.263428	1128.896973SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.000989	BB	1221.781372	4006.198242SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.000516	AA	1731.786621	294.381348SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.000654	AA	4310.638672	1077.454102SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.003720	AA	1390.531006	239.792801!sample_table_end
