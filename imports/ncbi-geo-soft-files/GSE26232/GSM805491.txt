Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805491/suppl/GSM805491.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805491/suppl/GSM805491.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.000431	AB	2811.261475	3193.158691SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.006056	BB	317.489716	1179.913696SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.004773	AB	3219.658936	3557.618408SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.006428	AB	1894.346802	1799.761475SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.008478	AA	864.189392	240.886688SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.001702	AA	2525.482910	436.048737SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.002405	BB	358.042542	1495.247437SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.011319	AA	4534.604004	1424.447632SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.000608	AA	2555.190918	586.297302SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.022099	BB	885.079651	4059.010498SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.007875	BB	816.353943	4113.574707SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.007548	BB	540.535706	2300.027344SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.010481	AA	992.652588	265.614990SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.009791	AA	1554.749146	660.548096SNP_A-1997922	NC	0.762642	AB	455.323242	762.627136SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.009277	AB	1227.792725	1411.396118SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.005876	BB	1433.638306	4867.259277SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.003401	AA	1435.252441	333.687103SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.000893	AA	4050.294434	1098.411743SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.004030	AA	1399.414185	254.726364!sample_table_end
