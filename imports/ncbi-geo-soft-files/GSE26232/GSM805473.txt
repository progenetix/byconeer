Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805473/suppl/GSM805473.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805473/suppl/GSM805473.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.002035	AA	3361.431152	498.460541SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.133510	BB	208.275085	764.888184SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.028288	AB	2362.567627	1005.186096SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.001386	BB	679.508057	2146.451904SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.003791	AA	1304.776733	216.235794SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.008903	AA	2881.301025	316.923798SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.007960	AB	1335.438477	942.271118SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.001728	AA	3392.858398	848.149231SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.001197	AA	2619.400635	563.037598SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.000280	BB	582.247986	2134.825684SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.001033	BB	447.778229	2785.142334SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.009359	BB	461.206085	2863.010254SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.013595	AA	1129.445068	301.379822SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.003130	AB	1257.513672	1668.933105SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.004386	BB	437.891357	1263.500854SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.000503	AB	1513.495972	2067.218750SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.002890	BB	1163.724731	4631.028809SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.016475	AB	1359.546631	1776.393188SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.005871	AB	2312.195557	2363.383789SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.000913	AA	1625.022339	297.491180!sample_table_end
