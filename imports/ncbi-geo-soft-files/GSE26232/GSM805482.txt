Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805482/suppl/GSM805482.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805482/suppl/GSM805482.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.008536	AB	1561.861938	2490.584961SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.336683	BB	588.340942	580.606140SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004815	BB	1587.633301	4847.842773SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.001959	BB	593.762878	1985.498291SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.005789	AA	1018.584290	291.401825SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.006487	AA	2859.743164	359.642090SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.013675	BB	336.845612	1835.231689SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.000900	AA	3114.311768	794.624512SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.001536	AA	2204.151611	514.511353SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.004974	AB	1470.925293	1510.564209SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.005298	AB	1261.798340	2043.435059SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.001590	BB	687.200989	3369.223145SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.005209	AA	1344.070557	302.663513SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.002977	AA	2005.152100	468.699829SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.005282	AB	691.641785	795.429626SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.004316	AA	2539.748291	796.018738SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.009227	AA	4014.206299	569.847778SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.001720	AA	1530.600464	267.515594SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.001931	AA	4448.836426	1036.509888SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.009842	AB	1073.277588	1394.029175!sample_table_end
