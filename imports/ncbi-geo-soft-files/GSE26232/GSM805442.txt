Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805442/suppl/GSM805442.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805442/suppl/GSM805442.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.002696	AB	3121.106445	3709.889648SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.120116	BB	293.384491	922.741333SNP_A-1969580	AB	0.003431	AB	2660.983154	3096.781982SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.005989	AB	2377.380615	1488.234131SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.018238	AA	811.406433	348.805603SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.001478	AA	2548.848145	368.527618SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.001119	BB	314.811035	1385.966553SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.041074	AA	6005.123535	1466.435425SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.007398	AA	3318.650391	791.552734SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.010668	BB	826.735535	3353.869385SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.008755	BB	880.500671	3979.666748SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.004766	BB	736.078430	2809.943115SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.005717	AA	1187.539062	234.411835SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.004570	AA	1319.492920	472.041077SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.052560	BB	348.506256	770.395142SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.004777	AB	1394.988892	1648.154785SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.004629	BB	1321.436157	4909.801758SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.002166	AA	1475.703735	291.018982SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.001706	AA	3957.233154	1068.782715SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.011680	AA	1120.433716	274.674622!sample_table_end
