Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805484/suppl/GSM805484.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805484/suppl/GSM805484.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.001641	BB	664.511536	4174.756836SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.118402	BB	279.161438	926.257568SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.000627	BB	1347.927124	4686.962891SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.001421	AB	2046.802002	1568.241577SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.001689	AA	1313.524292	272.011902SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.003750	AB	1863.297729	1339.391357SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.007420	BB	334.421844	1682.298340SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.007885	AA	4170.145996	971.231201SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.000909	AA	2288.687256	514.220642SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.001425	AB	1684.726685	1224.649292SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.003949	AB	1338.810181	1715.247314SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.005613	BB	619.676819	3731.744141SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.002581	AA	1431.507568	268.971344SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.003965	AA	2102.411133	483.215820SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.001305	AB	993.244812	833.225220SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.001932	AA	2450.676025	932.923523SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.007039	AA	3945.887695	630.007019SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.003259	AA	1429.222046	244.976761SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.007397	AA	4910.626465	1059.019897SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.002540	AA	1481.800171	279.161438!sample_table_end
