Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805458/suppl/GSM805458.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805458/suppl/GSM805458.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.001846	BB	694.073425	4062.622070SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.133354	BB	280.118561	813.993835SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.006779	BB	1678.859985	5153.847168SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.004010	BB	565.420898	1783.207642SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.007985	AA	894.379761	262.772766SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.003541	AA	2722.421387	377.291107SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.001579	BB	369.214478	1398.590820SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.000505	AA	3087.878174	874.852966SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.002129	AB	1440.507446	1423.617920SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.000600	AA	2298.978760	356.222229SNP_A-1995893	AA	0.002563	AA	2520.125244	944.141296SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.009429	BB	456.938263	2320.598877SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.000622	AA	1679.230103	300.100616SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.002885	AA	1794.697266	410.274200SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.022717	AA	822.291321	259.300110SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.003996	AA	2031.005249	742.474060SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.003343	AA	3664.137207	641.937134SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.002956	AA	1449.029175	248.179733SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.008001	AA	3460.170166	840.898804SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.002840	AB	981.303833	1118.486084!sample_table_end
