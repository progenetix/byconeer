Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805441/suppl/GSM805441.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805441/suppl/GSM805441.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.006737	AB	2305.783447	3503.484131SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.160371	BB	353.972778	741.614197SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001363	BB	1388.554688	4428.193848SNP_A-4263484	AA	0.000855	AA	3192.687012	517.735352SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.004240	AB	476.466827	855.009338SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.002873	AA	2117.858887	320.882660SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.002537	BB	377.281891	1274.231812SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.016232	AA	5314.314941	1584.219604SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.015941	AA	3684.817627	778.674194SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.013978	BB	819.112000	3490.394287SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.003074	BB	561.975159	2593.191895SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.012622	BB	740.133362	2223.209717SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.020629	AA	918.002869	229.178329SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.019376	AB	1067.479126	1125.742554SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.007800	AB	506.391907	516.124756SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.009325	AA	1700.040405	962.020630SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.008713	BB	1583.505859	4838.513672SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.004403	AA	1351.904785	239.999664SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.010806	AA	3308.929932	966.200989SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.010855	AB	809.339966	565.107910!sample_table_end
