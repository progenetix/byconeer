Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805457/suppl/GSM805457.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805457/suppl/GSM805457.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.001000	BB	975.017273	4563.952637SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.155413	BB	320.194031	734.996521SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.006412	BB	966.454041	3251.799561SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.002308	BB	813.874878	2558.929688SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.004595	AA	1171.561401	349.015930SNP_A-4264431	BB	0.006703	BB	483.182251	1545.322632SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.001625	BB	308.372894	1174.876221SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.003554	AA	3155.835938	1071.478882SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.002132	AA	2128.928223	504.021515SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.001214	AB	1670.148438	1227.932617SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.009196	AB	1634.723755	1619.691772SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.003071	BB	848.894470	3435.414307SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.000981	AA	1726.608765	330.678467SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.003207	AA	1450.587646	417.522766SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.001586	AB	802.095886	795.807007SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.000926	AB	1569.207275	2050.002930SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.003974	BB	1390.815674	3734.012939SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.001995	AB	1158.007080	1340.247070SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.006786	AB	2726.019775	2663.092041SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.005674	AA	1275.682495	213.549133!sample_table_end
