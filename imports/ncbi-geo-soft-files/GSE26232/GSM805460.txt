Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805460/suppl/GSM805460.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805460/suppl/GSM805460.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.057622	BB	1715.691528	4235.665039SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.115635	BB	331.087555	1009.903137SNP_A-1969580	NC	0.433886	AB	2112.040283	5401.229492SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.003570	BB	830.939758	2747.863770SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.002798	AA	1176.576172	231.341690SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.006953	AA	2790.141602	537.732361SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.004485	BB	373.822906	1606.122437SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.006692	AA	4150.463379	1443.989868SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.019442	AA	2669.500732	1211.488525SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.008555	BB	774.965881	3183.930176SNP_A-1995893	AA	0.011351	AA	3191.045166	1929.675049SNP_A-1997689	AB	0.018914	AB	2746.560059	1418.640503SNP_A-1997709	NC	0.805435	BB	524.499084	1282.453613SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.000933	AA	1657.514648	465.768005SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.016269	BB	420.773621	895.935852SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.001985	AA	2371.922363	944.065002SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.008892	BB	1622.085083	4648.930664SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.003614	AA	1995.293213	312.395966SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.004904	AA	3832.966797	1220.160400SNP_A-4268173	BB	0.010452	BB	283.592468	1278.172729!sample_table_end
