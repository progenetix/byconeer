Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805443/suppl/GSM805443.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805443/suppl/GSM805443.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.008730	BB	600.160583	3041.793457SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.151814	BB	238.034714	693.263123SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.003206	BB	1262.141479	4889.771973SNP_A-4263484	AA	0.004424	AA	2743.608643	344.857056SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.011929	AA	814.120911	282.517548SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.004119	AA	2706.506592	346.706543SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.002201	AB	1115.716553	914.608276SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.002647	AA	3413.061523	804.818420SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.001296	AA	2276.329346	443.218872SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.001702	BB	413.704163	1835.531494SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.002418	BB	412.014801	2538.835693SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.008825	BB	534.258118	2143.029297SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.007533	AA	1107.416504	226.512405SNP_A-1997896	BB	0.002906	BB	554.504456	2638.331543SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.007131	AA	859.766113	228.637009SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.007660	AA	2373.723633	607.794739SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.008731	AB	2979.041504	2820.265869SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.002138	AA	1519.993286	253.516495SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.004624	AA	4156.179199	800.710938SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.004162	AA	2044.938599	316.795135!sample_table_end
