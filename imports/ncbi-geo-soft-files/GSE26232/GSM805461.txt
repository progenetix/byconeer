Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805461/suppl/GSM805461.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805461/suppl/GSM805461.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.013690	BB	736.709473	2980.273682SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.281072	BB	391.720917	489.376862SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.007015	BB	949.500244	3728.224854SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.005127	AB	1949.174927	1002.926819SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.002262	AA	1199.666016	259.020111SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.002104	AA	2190.869385	377.789398SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.001419	BB	332.210968	1225.340454SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.001353	AA	2914.802734	723.121033SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.007410	AB	1434.586182	1047.995239SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.014073	AB	978.069214	1160.890869SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.012023	AB	912.566956	1789.058472SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.003644	BB	702.319946	2864.953857SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.005017	AA	1220.209839	234.769928SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.002050	AA	1512.466064	471.436676SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.021794	AB	550.649231	720.254456SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.003476	AA	2066.911865	852.358215SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.001484	AA	3620.279785	814.078125SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.009773	AA	1124.530762	282.505554SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.001719	AA	4020.050537	952.966797SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.002509	AA	1478.522583	253.990723!sample_table_end
