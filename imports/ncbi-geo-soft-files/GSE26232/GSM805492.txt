Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805492/suppl/GSM805492.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805492/suppl/GSM805492.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.005561	AA	4477.334961	1000.038818SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.025434	BB	441.133331	1635.636108SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.020127	BB	2358.834961	6858.022949SNP_A-4263484	AA	0.010991	AA	4227.684570	686.443848SNP_A-1978185	BB	0.009697	BB	993.827332	3335.282471SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.024379	AB	2303.292725	1840.594849SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.033880	AB	1620.829712	1736.804443SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.016549	AA	4418.645508	1505.847534SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.006706	AA	3227.056152	813.653748SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.021466	BB	836.132935	3963.760986SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.006655	BB	771.664124	3989.061523SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.004108	BB	953.278137	4430.239746SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.003604	AA	1885.515991	344.121246SNP_A-1997896	BB	0.002925	BB	797.922058	2539.862549SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.007321	BB	602.887451	1519.347900SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.022135	AA	1389.654419	939.937744SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.014678	AB	1840.232056	1863.302979SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.018795	AA	1062.854980	344.121246SNP_A-2000342	NC	0.221598	AA	2610.394775	773.635559SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.001260	AB	1189.832397	1115.771240!sample_table_end
