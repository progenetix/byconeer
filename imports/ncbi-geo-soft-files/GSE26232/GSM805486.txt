Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805486/suppl/GSM805486.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805486/suppl/GSM805486.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.001587	BB	664.022400	4216.020508SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.261520	BB	470.111389	583.855286SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.003738	BB	1078.972290	3999.535645SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.005575	BB	464.175598	1615.441772SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.010954	AA	850.872681	289.563904SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.003651	AA	2064.135254	364.508331SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.013124	AB	1179.446533	622.063721SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.002010	AA	2844.703857	661.585083SNP_A-4265735	BB	0.003240	BB	541.352600	2337.158691SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.002470	BB	398.150909	2089.642334SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.000593	BB	542.487854	3019.212891SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.004247	BB	581.433716	2972.995117SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.014431	AA	1037.006226	260.611908SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.020315	AB	859.111572	1931.298462SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.004526	AB	877.878662	617.557251SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.004336	AA	1941.864990	737.649597SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.003465	AA	3797.739746	788.788513SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.001957	AA	1493.141235	280.429535SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.003190	AA	3805.921875	940.281372SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.002527	AA	1480.150513	274.380768!sample_table_end
