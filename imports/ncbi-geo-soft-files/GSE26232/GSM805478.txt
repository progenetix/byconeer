Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805478/suppl/GSM805478.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805478/suppl/GSM805478.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.007929	BB	678.337952	3186.797363SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.161979	BB	251.836044	662.192627SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001360	BB	1281.584229	4649.145020SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.004544	BB	481.816956	1698.677490SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.010160	AA	847.592773	275.092102SNP_A-4264431	BB	0.008063	BB	547.711731	2290.302734SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.001683	BB	304.382355	1406.198120SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.001822	AA	3146.578369	745.789185SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.004885	AA	1925.009644	523.885742SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.003226	AB	1173.415283	997.702515SNP_A-1995893	NC	0.132826	AB	1357.464355	1207.644043SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.004240	BB	606.184082	2753.279541SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.001942	AA	1431.068848	232.376984SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.001979	AA	1897.526489	461.258209SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.003645	AB	726.770874	591.343567SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.003666	AB	1330.602051	1679.150024SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.004256	BB	1093.607178	3650.211426SNP_A-2000337	AB	0.003421	AB	879.945740	1087.753906SNP_A-2000342	AB	0.003996	AB	2542.815186	2426.088867SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.001869	AA	1559.121094	310.498718!sample_table_end
