Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805459/suppl/GSM805459.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805459/suppl/GSM805459.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.010438	AB	2316.900635	1752.090332SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.612116	BB	656.458374	440.140930SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.003353	BB	1219.999023	4752.186523SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.007748	AB	2249.242676	1172.054321SNP_A-1978185	BB	0.011437	BB	576.995239	1816.269043SNP_A-4264431	BB	0.003623	BB	426.233582	2047.379272SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.002398	BB	369.160889	1489.592651SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.005882	AA	3615.987061	757.437866SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.002569	AA	2052.902588	457.452637SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.002091	BB	376.434906	1764.609741SNP_A-1995893	NC	0.114472	AB	1769.591187	1487.796143SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.004119	BB	620.635498	2749.674561SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.007633	AB	844.996643	615.201477SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.005311	AA	1823.441406	361.919434SNP_A-1997922	NC	0.164832	AB	588.115906	852.295227SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.005129	AA	2391.426025	712.673340SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.001047	BB	1207.780396	4010.443115SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.002538	AA	1476.245361	253.629883SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.000167	AA	4225.924316	1062.150024SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.009019	AB	1176.210083	729.169861!sample_table_end
