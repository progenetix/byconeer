Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805488/suppl/GSM805488.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805488/suppl/GSM805488.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.006343	BB	546.371582	3222.020508SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.181449	BB	307.332977	635.347046SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004168	BB	1378.248169	5344.049805SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.005601	AB	1432.221313	1096.922974SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.007317	AA	933.206299	273.331879SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.011470	AA	3135.688232	437.962524SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.004926	BB	443.410553	1548.757446SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.001023	AA	3192.923584	960.685730SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.004146	AB	1199.582764	1571.397461SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.004781	AA	1909.358643	399.279816SNP_A-1995893	AA	0.001636	AA	2566.545654	1023.200195SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.008333	BB	552.662170	2189.527344SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.000869	AA	1716.588623	323.447296SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.001064	AA	1726.106934	456.047791SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.001267	AA	1008.332581	245.199066SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.003822	AA	2057.543457	757.256897SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.008983	AA	4090.047852	1048.427124SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.004983	AA	1343.938110	222.876511SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.001643	AA	3958.832275	1004.591980SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.001637	AB	1025.296143	907.876770!sample_table_end
