Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805493/suppl/GSM805493.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805493/suppl/GSM805493.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.032392	AB	4772.296387	6222.714355SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.068222	BB	373.954376	1929.647949SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.036817	BB	2650.640625	7098.512695SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.019723	BB	1142.239868	3645.018555SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.015492	AA	854.483032	339.992554SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.000879	AA	2302.004883	373.954376SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.007791	AB	619.831299	798.653015SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.022962	AA	5416.724609	1583.073120SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.004512	AA	3027.921143	700.417175SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.054325	BB	1045.707397	4966.645020SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.073603	BB	1355.927002	6233.395996SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.011629	BB	1107.949951	5337.422363SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.002193	AA	2034.332275	332.881470SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.025008	AA	2669.093994	649.267517SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.011095	BB	813.681274	1571.546509SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.009651	AA	1583.342407	916.694397SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.002981	AA	3766.565186	872.064026SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.005832	AA	1389.403076	372.163147SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.004541	AA	3634.547607	1089.900513SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.008954	AA	1166.758789	212.791504!sample_table_end
