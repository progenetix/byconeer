Data quality control and data analysis was performed using Partek GS 6.4.  SNP calls were made using Birdseed V-2.  The following criteria were applied for quality control parameters:  Contrast QC>0.4, QC call rate >86%, SNP call rate >97% and MAPD<0.4.  Copy number calls of SNP 6.0 data were determined using a Hidden Markov Model and a minimum criterion of 50 markers was used to identify significant CNAs.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The CNA data are available as supplementary files of the GSE26232 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Theresa ,V,Strong!Sample_contact_email = tvstrong@uab.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 205-975-9878!Sample_contact_fax = 205-934-9511!Sample_contact_laboratory = Strong!Sample_contact_department = Medicine !Sample_contact_institute = University of Alabama at Birmingham!Sample_contact_address = 1530 3rd Avenue South!Sample_contact_city = Birmingham !Sample_contact_state = AL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 35294!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805480/suppl/GSM805480.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM805nnn/GSM805480/suppl/GSM805480.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE26232!Sample_series_id = GSE26233!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = Probe set name#VALUE = Genotype call: AA, AB, BB or No call#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.085926	AB	1258.431396	2761.494141SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.220398	BB	451.675385	649.209412SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.002507	BB	1166.449707	3769.270508SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.025810	BB	1095.550415	1958.226685SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.003041	AA	1314.104614	380.173615SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.006803	AA	1941.995361	399.039917SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.001823	BB	332.789490	1448.511963SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.001324	AA	2831.879150	743.836731SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.008023	AA	1759.241699	504.060089SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.003320	BB	640.456543	1805.995605SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.004790	BB	411.769379	2312.825684SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.009405	BB	845.170898	2800.517822SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.008880	AA	1063.422852	222.870575SNP_A-1997896	BB	0.013476	BB	927.695984	2387.884277SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.000835	BB	499.956543	1123.861450SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.004189	AA	2150.245117	1046.628906SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.002534	BB	1228.551880	3746.731445SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.010543	AA	1194.725342	348.817413SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.013608	AA	3226.024658	863.202087SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.000967	AA	1622.468628	301.420837!sample_table_end
