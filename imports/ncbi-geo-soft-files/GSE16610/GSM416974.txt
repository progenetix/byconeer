DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416974/suppl/GSM416974_KC0147.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416974/suppl/GSM416974_KC0148.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16610!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2683.115287776853	5059.854636800367	2915.205820030118	4683.587514966835	1.064179670973025	1.623182593424022	.6556130377964388	-0.6542	.63543824522326852	2220.944689738436	2498.405449493794	2440.244319212843	2299.100497153997	.8584899757510875	.8395701889150199	1.022535086507202	-0.2192	.85905012359279453	3105.623364135262	4725.392127221033	3347.926562333914	4371.04515460795	1.196155054312844	1.581297823576478	.7564388165712244	-0.3127	.80513322178601934	9308.414015461312	14957.24680970444	9148.897633352324	14004.43567891009	3.23670677632402	4.948722005927809	.654049019614952	-0.5921	.66335864572723215	8521.3000340913	11972.8113458408	8457.57754550809	11083.51934720552	3.009850500250342	3.994426148176988	.753512616981041	-0.4133	.75090759440956836	6188.560002076799	10021.92386726529	6352.331903305163	9294.500708749612	2.350807107974466	3.320474569314881	.707973230603453	-0.4389	.73767475206533187	1789.863929635537	3024.580444513112	1993.15834400708	2786.25254437577	.7004919948054725	.9681827437559793	.7235121668126161	-0.2551	.83794469957793248	1264.452264236621	1990.830499092522	1440.046291792068	1833.879824285127	.5095908251367834	.6650492784659371	.7662452116514611	-0.3717	.77288603566571439	2018.694613124786	3437.22795688355	2230.662799846234	3173.010509747326	.7845664910315442	1.120706591717758	.7000641352782653	-0.2124	.863087906648810710	14185.59171741944	18801.13143445278	13490.77091947891	17964.1395584682	4.425155465180168	6.253352548714403	.7076452879807511	-0.3683	.77470369370831611	5916.886411886584	11658.81002734175	6099.11374689878	10795.47046419547	2.278371713604491	3.908208809773729	.5829708248716631	-0.7158	.608854107664755912	14638.27696975931	23341.16167464289	13929.14918430244	22660.43800950074	5.205999346123164	8.45207457607238	.6159433757081632	-0.6883	.620570767861893113	3741.13755094577	5452.508854021124	4001.223196404167	5044.1733074971	1.394827181884104	1.734157683420631	.8043254631451989	-0.3286	.796330575235401814	6736.108905300182	9477.058399597208	6855.608276956266	8792.629495400686	2.28223795506423	3.110546036070841	.7337097501849199	-0.4335	.740452203188457115	2121.627452720816	2771.944073471938	2337.588862692898	2551.883133192801	.8125807097437094	.9243996580397182	.8790361427295073	-0.0531	.963840540971956416	3574.276968358002	6133.001333879685	3829.844939426888	5662.065894459691	1.337347036363904	1.970384378003275	.6787239339154371	-0.4166	.749182473566375917	599.977186198859	646.5066304724775	715.5292543756705	605.1884337387019	.255490432883181	.2215370224652844	1.153262917593006	0.2105	1.157128213423418	3646.441372879666	7402.555553819186	3898.297849834756	6851.846680214668	1.352667516432247	2.472290321884208	.5471313398991658	-0.7062	.612952849745651719	1452.030974870495	2126.660072354902	1639.0895895053	1958.675513863146	.5585275645596592	.679805843702833	.8215986516347323	-0.1820	.881458540680838720	1765.979004476416	2807.923610049172	1968.039386387692	2584.189618435116	.6949947622355328	.9142513770725426	.7601790707288018	-0.4493	.7324139977419677!sample_table_end
