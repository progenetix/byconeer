DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416973/suppl/GSM416973_KC0143.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416973/suppl/GSM416973_KC0144.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16610!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1496.859270048196	2227.624623809939	1657.466524624086	1979.438116879653	1.47390311889312	1.725606238517449	.854136410725671	-0.2264	.85474628822886332	621.7339871042684	630.8831102729054	714.270345017631	571.3815218193755	.6379087414836861	.5119093176968571	1.246136218722714	-0.0915	.93857247451499083	1307.617223716256	2303.083019518266	1454.150225359396	2044.629772134704	1.149314670358489	1.5600502980544	.7367164198435427	-0.3959	.7600208488826464	4305.64126853222	7634.684288757786	4523.422314638104	6642.307485489604	3.714164858310503	5.438802012085683	.682901280476321	-0.4307	.74187885181447915	4627.79793038462	6496.531641526024	4840.892868997976	5657.508976044536	3.972343878598448	4.783746943346651	.8303833638447948	-0.2526	.83940782727017496	4274.163195787394	7087.468672720469	4496.343554823258	6159.274087809978	3.558187436191595	4.800283000480081	.7412453465422222	-0.3252	.79819109500523937	890.6880388115347	1660.349868181844	1005.39355059392	1479.881869266476	.8419791269135942	1.286303827278575	.6545725116086798	-0.3266	.79743580461159478	524.8713245164997	850.155222199101	608.3132420216253	764.102297399135	.5152058618467426	.668743824090527	.7704084034681115	-0.1908	.87611654886539989	1156.342035641272	1972.071463224953	1291.946022629422	1756.222654806924	1.016068204028875	1.374568857072786	.7391904732896711	-0.2774	.825080442243485210	5476.659504989846	7260.698171032392	5665.278316729979	6329.518949957335	4.395759736899952	4.946395615309036	.8886793695383216	-0.0808	.945501494555830511	2721.894741568084	5442.53393609557	2940.020174582603	4751.784228577766	2.610824364130888	4.001576292673696	.6524489783965701	-0.5431	.686272609016445512	6914.62681975363	13321.73038751132	7055.037387970458	12076.09887530442	6.35482475918976	10.84980259198215	.5857087910415889	-0.6473	.638476285665183113	1812.529866809157	2543.42867636503	1993.583698739916	2255.024042137794	1.674223889377329	1.861132363031747	.8995727131680483	-0.1322	.912427207492557614	3502.169847937456	4495.474732739732	3729.824884934332	3936.186701697401	3.081047038352888	3.398109075890608	.9066945673441574	-0.2099	.864622920014910515	850.4604992232249	1010.320046924948	962.1455880650632	906.359767197102	.7721958872037071	.7514248710577295	1.027642172818608	0.1040	1.07478336117572716	1674.494881931816	2651.695055646208	1846.867417199328	2348.59398205576	1.488326741858705	1.930499418745439	.7709542553635753	-0.2102	.864424530941986517	291.6715708579981	323.9459977050298	348.9529004482168	298.4316492810572	.2397575023034162	.2035155269602882	1.178079657530012	0.1777	1.1310604607396218	1633.959155868822	3804.496625413016	1803.062226669654	3347.193887669825	1.367545192158576	2.683729918983802	.5095688588054342	-0.7287	.603454716413994719	628.062421908268	838.6781450682954	720.2786301806957	754.3478027529634	.5853535567805648	.6374640848323547	.9182533898117659	-0.0955	.935935327894793620	622.9261464517538	1089.416006156565	715.908161902236	975.948887207989	.6977498490343321	.9105757257504554	.7662732810709162	-0.3139	.8044804909459151!sample_table_end
