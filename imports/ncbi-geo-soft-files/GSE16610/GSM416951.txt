DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416951/suppl/GSM416951_KC0133.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416951/suppl/GSM416951_KC0134.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16610!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1915.080104149678	3932.218074992156	2129.210193283326	3519.824973648464	1.141380518369476	1.816944463734758	.6281867944512458	-0.5088	.70282063426252352	1056.020208113114	1488.429245487798	1197.049018077887	1344.027047929649	.6522392744601794	.7331588620564545	.8896288488291585	-0.3266	.7974039120303193	2616.424467564358	2967.526368225098	2869.46512077688	2661.572460253469	1.454973702506084	1.363391876290249	1.067172049216713	0.1089	1.0784407240986424	5503.938314405799	8330.97196880058	5790.924566839286	7417.718549701975	2.864279622696354	3.823647833798477	.7490960849945558	-0.4014	.75711656233621275	6415.309030797013	10475.0089864369	6678.285318435524	9305.866774711072	3.396682156737735	4.793365632182451	.7086215443137817	-0.3646	.77666634421528616	4076.012725094122	7396.001961217822	4373.919274612512	6587.694621142654	2.2726063276693	3.40204301742817	.6680122256029889	-0.5270	.69401692434137027	1352.139052888094	2993.897031390196	1518.931477168924	2683.673400427768	.7768436789180141	1.414560263698587	.5491767999242647	-0.7724	.58542377909548448	688.434187351503	1095.613469853572	796.5662078144416	993.6789394698937	.413630576290175	.5175731680690804	.7991731446073878	-0.1805	.88242131830762549	1416.018993341037	2235.502581187612	1588.288389014376	2008.844280393746	.7785300785945937	1.01445791082639	.7674345779021954	-0.1810	.882121149068979310	9598.168884140527	12458.28538931157	9771.23051328551	11100.34908959508	5.116499545929671	5.579899242217777	.9169519598522498	-0.1571	.89680741686942111	10433.92104257494	13899.68167994169	10598.24377152872	12530.6762943855	5.453644371013053	6.343722191880864	.8596915511200989	-0.1990	.871144477767879112	8262.735868740923	17141.8166598318	8475.892540580142	15709.67631654794	4.645000330205515	8.799867743852285	.527848879711923	-0.6457	.63918513218997113	3464.297166001552	4308.432984662122	3752.546813380234	3856.969397594007	1.947795122670422	1.937489012525642	1.005319312820952	-0.0424	.97101606153950714	4298.479791232246	5852.915520589333	4598.538674801205	5225.485025200411	2.370124487545114	2.7988856108347	.8468100583925904	-0.2563	.837216562517857615	2452.090293906818	2882.656779958392	2702.260450033322	2584.010334078808	1.378936350907099	1.325767590601985	1.040104133395636	0.0953	1.06831501657241216	3397.800877384788	5024.917984600161	3681.868622573028	4494.436850147027	1.932463411959204	2.353177728202758	.8212143897159545	-0.1985	.871428238113917217	786.5560117847174	779.9620254977657	903.3406930437106	714.4989179029633	.4422123755743866	.344835225045256	1.282387480908746	0.2780	1.21254387945666618	2443.864873389194	5053.935312501195	2693.547579656992	4517.261990602125	1.411822045842084	2.310489441583788	.6110489061029043	-0.6233	.649175414651444119	1533.538155266338	1874.977957320099	1716.12418049322	1688.820412584759	.8539339120424818	.8321297066314693	1.026202892694791	0.0424	1.02981243695883620	744.0431239808494	1501.548344091503	857.3678275087577	1355.491054205898	.4514415084776234	.693044621927245	.651388805560943	-0.4598	.7270946301595207!sample_table_end
