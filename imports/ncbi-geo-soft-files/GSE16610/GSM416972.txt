DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416972/suppl/GSM416972_KC0141.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416972/suppl/GSM416972_KC0142.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16610!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2123.045450218958	3686.022672979221	2370.029446124184	3287.369341768411	1.256988359932896	1.682554752417481	.7470712962694765	-0.4592	.7273803284639652	1702.863065433774	2068.29832515655	1923.847354786878	1837.471473198883	1.007150169004899	.9690607881023232	1.039305460885653	-0.1625	.89349395982301073	2344.514752337215	3393.491250152099	2602.570351154758	3025.578675340669	1.397708791485368	1.643501252379921	.850445832920038	-0.2686	.83010748854771424	6371.918401369477	12205.81966720697	6544.212969333283	11090.42903939837	3.352120336298124	5.639842355742732	.5943641904963619	-0.7670	.58762829872172575	5837.544543517609	9536.061739581299	6051.224448516396	8550.047371418588	3.162331187102196	4.51780245596891	.6999711071749344	-0.4780	.71799648701401666	3552.654451965526	7628.099495774625	3845.42399911601	6829.432752299092	2.090526458347771	3.617722166355086	.5778571051668155	-0.5821	.66801348884641957	1383.465549207378	2585.135720831295	1580.477554951926	2301.602235636372	.7769195331244496	1.139085372900678	.6820555786314999	-0.2031	.86866427022700678	644.1478760578116	1209.995841496297	772.3915020894719	1072.231574455265	.4150297774784169	.5559133500451535	.7465727841303081	-0.4285	.74302847386140369	1166.344982547672	2113.8204723747	1346.877184109695	1877.864813121237	.6931750622626066	.940001875237135	.737418807901568	-0.2753	.826281125988649610	9555.852880159511	13233.78770461588	9395.858824503266	12133.6056350409	4.727381056483725	6.067414732161801	.7791425615633454	-0.1943	.873979992981396211	5469.062725609185	9453.71754985934	5706.124382308024	8483.138219785415	3.017715075684794	4.2970405586135	.7022775406752274	-0.6524	.636225207977840412	10057.31573320314	18452.39919815105	9884.089211733837	17542.27825052897	5.440316061794038	9.45133414271567	.575613556736537	-0.6824	.623131080237294413	2531.337120853548	3389.25679593084	2798.434689167585	3018.304281923836	1.440636737662042	1.528111218581118	.9427564696499656	-0.1767	.88470041866274714	4783.010567922606	6658.21624618645	5055.415926691338	5957.158931502948	2.406982205498776	3.114496687049434	.7728318400553731	-0.4153	.749886652550180815	1849.887340100494	2244.828532736399	2080.513735747564	1995.169717101651	1.097474772511579	1.065251430235131	1.03024951796529	0.0618	1.04376690062772916	2849.950320245728	4328.754830163716	3129.668762472846	3867.296210717814	1.5073859536582	1.946020131844301	.7745993625613753	-0.2153	.861395874987439917	387.5937028669378	454.1623188087635	479.8451577235454	410.6715125496665	.2367614740942055	.2088563116056008	1.133609380890056	0.1981	1.14717862426621218	2416.28910258255	6084.543014919601	2678.353631601709	5445.060786680907	1.299870251911204	2.887052973699002	.4502412195941665	-0.9355	.522855161131025319	1040.114335263228	1523.49063354612	1209.707125189741	1353.612613949713	.6111477909414073	.6915572879439025	.883726918356158	-0.0950	.936253251035921220	883.5083545236113	1698.785728452881	1037.974273250036	1508.661617011916	.5553350270192018	.7816002658017259	.7105102842430169	-0.4862	.7139272564278385!sample_table_end
