DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416971/suppl/GSM416971_KC0137.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416971/suppl/GSM416971_KC0138.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16610!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2647.925708392056	4557.985801826344	2817.998977349958	4206.711087879933	1.16322412992038	1.676053881233838	.6940254981922566	-0.4730	.72046194677735432	1673.037183616866	1485.047653893884	1793.576522820059	1411.807814188816	.7537440679427581	.6002032963360172	1.2558146090567	-0.0005	.99965941746651183	3603.122677774636	4871.680481638706	3816.402097049464	4487.976792392234	1.526336793099004	1.784871628696496	.8551521401086412	-0.2908	.81743141721218244	5072.539514921114	9736.208210598112	5329.953757669201	8775.155136529078	2.105984150917199	3.631662124264339	.5798953974397618	-0.7602	.59040056139002775	6022.355722534904	8477.699220397226	6293.170506483775	7660.398496621235	2.592103651430179	3.148810990338186	.8232007762243565	-0.3347	.79297004417660936	6477.738265861612	8737.285659632182	6749.305830549983	7888.928343682342	2.814100679615805	3.318502222752604	.8480032528896694	-0.2387	.84748245359760327	2137.653734255702	2299.339518795476	2281.36975005484	2165.233887234913	.9064423766620632	.8914681869966085	1.016797222698326	0.0259	1.018095137109758	1003.075410961061	1356.68950376933	1094.919858467744	1292.324793570414	.4603499724562998	.542077412439792	.8492328990140875	-0.1751	.88570311020183099	2730.964167279272	3880.251699202399	2905.07103984179	3600.180635719578	1.20023263713294	1.536089636348012	.7813558588849296	-0.2184	.859499653212220210	11610.04816325403	16724.82665653309	12073.7266752696	15275.29286535731	4.807346966918056	6.342784268101977	.7579237703376303	-0.2875	.819299530927595611	11461.64251837757	16766.64617653112	11912.5795685408	15325.8277023486	5.046688939503804	6.566752101772448	.7685213117975993	-0.3257	.797912539171338212	6700.994271659511	17409.45732049594	6981.021135268104	15962.15509687809	3.071919720168	7.219732923151824	.4254893848382044	-1.0239	.491791190933326813	4025.382075877202	5908.792020618701	4250.104697870462	5402.933020346486	1.733148331831705	2.225865603413166	.7786401520262842	-0.2871	.819575294414713114	4095.105793898088	6852.231649687641	4320.641115923044	6226.597896826474	1.701340179616929	2.542605729108512	.669132520287938	-0.5302	.692451930317092415	3084.718909541346	3703.59887809268	3276.411730595375	3441.599247153314	1.324195674398868	1.436157157489135	.922040925321842	-0.0333	.977195555659903316	5082.683966510429	6448.48005901497	5340.470763753518	5871.10436791242	2.124453804701623	2.319605173146638	.9158687130446924	-0.1641	.892485320970984217	1260.006960480241	1208.377437504598	1363.637939130957	1152.911325263572	.5358915005846205	.4566804394518583	1.173449647258458	0.1990	1.14793197772075518	2901.456246088122	5421.725962341936	3083.982044434514	4975.024496886617	1.263268914725176	2.036166177722914	.6204154300106859	-0.6167	.652176034116777419	2191.059765506193	3191.329933828332	2337.204061721506	2981.114348611318	.878446325101283	1.137586930659524	.7722014919703738	-0.2584	.836012047117801220	1052.167129278253	1704.396748978764	1145.838982613504	1616.043571511114	.4957873035194	.6973205058516694	.7109891353530071	-0.4071	.7541299628576442!sample_table_end
