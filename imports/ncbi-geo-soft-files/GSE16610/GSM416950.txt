DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416950/suppl/GSM416950_KC0121.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416950/suppl/GSM416950_KC0122.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16610!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	4028.322387195665	6579.372718900034	4507.858818189403	5728.786681887086	1.707853460280908	2.074994354980223	.8230641477080962	-0.4558	.72911169647026772	1881.338622493727	2021.114208653554	2193.836634457728	1750.594308644216	.7833476003286396	.6409197201490419	1.222224212646284	0.3192	1.247671588008063	3361.547446465784	5043.302826802383	3803.28299516245	4395.357870551858	1.266419542706558	1.475800318737584	.8581239119055531	-0.0638	.95671456686335544	5928.785370080806	11445.60661715268	6474.946100996524	10015.47468482786	2.116304153569981	3.386580686460228	.6249088238266709	-0.3500	.78456216496262015	11060.75908272925	14045.83850076004	11675.83748911114	12367.98235860289	4.153127867594187	4.378188782410952	.9485949724870408	-0.4065	.75444152826530326	7979.678613253565	12367.63669656021	8543.648907715235	10843.56137587214	3.153699664913022	3.996505006437222	.7891144036685346	-0.2357	.84927850644899747	1701.254300411419	3453.450159868992	1998.733163883369	3003.173826527588	.7150321487135048	1.058448847641733	.6755471937133526	-0.3731	.77210848353063658	788.99355124481	1390.691326127268	976.735444405519	1203.616440688064	.341757532084467	.4281840619727924	.7981556588301572	-0.1777	.88410611493233849	3880.535919804738	5611.570725341331	4350.973939052468	4884.261912292145	1.512855411612347	1.690961794019122	.8946715513994861	-0.0729	.950723464171110210	14905.72829524846	19853.67106174128	15645.3263114742	17760.3717960694	5.357179737552912	6.295152062811804	.8510008470168813	0.1046	1.07520067850282611	20284.96474732304	26969.25214854888	21298.74616228578	24696.24744309229	7.931133612908777	9.111138536604866	.8704876543194571	-0.2482	.841969394608978312	9603.879837590175	18599.95263112871	10180.36527676341	16573.81815647468	3.891988183329256	6.250124924747885	.6227056627170137	-0.4099	.752676166039375613	5319.310654669857	7699.174411295503	5855.710203840647	6713.209475987168	2.019732521893114	2.333542827629432	.8655219428498305	0.1200	1.08676675817943714	6249.576250670259	9002.327640350512	6798.460350838457	7854.212673274575	2.369424879809387	2.745369969502136	.8630621395771566	-0.3163	.803115006104967915	2908.646499136206	3074.879522808624	3313.586586956516	2671.326153088158	1.225926146902933	1.004336352499477	1.22063305171817	0.2698	1.20565628906765716	4703.779658759918	6481.445622712664	5214.423610335102	5645.204629498338	1.783003505392082	1.980727754479313	.9001759587403731	-0.0645	.956258820541391417	1095.815235559344	1302.029588595176	1326.386756088914	1125.101672320863	.4394658037712339	.3867818131852525	1.136211137106253	0.1289	1.09342216028598818	3609.992667916115	7871.483069359192	4067.240208103949	6864.590854621674	1.413380583846848	2.505443862275808	.564123828567051	-0.8376	.559577290649813519	2669.485902536138	4260.191277607185	3055.993503457586	3708.982182096568	1.017679837327452	1.243666795837775	.8182897868893485	-0.1080	.927898731359114820	1156.17537308736	2077.759938560839	1394.936151672482	1801.363053372478	.5022601973003761	.660277448729956	.7606805264460779	-0.4262	.7442402934833491!sample_table_end
