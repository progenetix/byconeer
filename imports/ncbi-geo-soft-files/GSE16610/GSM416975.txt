DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416975/suppl/GSM416975_KC0177.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416975/suppl/GSM416975_KC0178.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16610!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	5055.997947654811	5760.051345268342	5285.347172721038	5466.093256233658	1.768941997007798	1.783226178968167	.9919896970284308	0.1599	1.1171909253728152	2080.794300597858	2320.20831426521	2277.837002075934	2107.828467432064	.7784117643870689	.726785548873642	1.071033629649676	-0.2552	.83787128306195933	3707.350202743716	4398.93224100083	3914.844130191942	4147.899386530489	1.223654698990616	1.320751713522923	.926483521817046	-0.0009	.99938244822518664	13360.26417388779	14736.194050263	13680.37879175573	14095.79804487406	4.524535887530328	4.568706119089478	.9903320042025479	-0.0105	.99275165002726065	14676.23518006639	19920.38065488495	14957.64742638158	18827.54486824435	5.027431395813524	6.448002304550116	.7796882132417746	-0.2153	.8613737463545746	13996.00812187575	16262.5830363381	14312.87344052658	15522.15595641264	4.840811614685419	5.311522293245462	.911379327324177	-0.0232	.98407954123759227	3966.536708051531	5158.286874910881	4183.386008165972	4885.774830481596	1.333908843459068	1.579413590586627	.8445595576796493	-0.0693	.95309404097220368	1580.223493360131	1952.896000954574	1779.252247163222	1746.805318221269	.5947471438197514	.567029531761442	1.048882131363082	0.0325	1.0227684237152599	3165.71840508296	3886.216624037802	3371.256073861874	3650.688471160637	1.047805803992672	1.121813097925457	.934028855546753	0.0255	1.01783908621378710	14703.92606986717	16211.94144186668	14996.63371073163	15440.04287846383	4.976508799734101	5.009640542076808	.9933864032629828	-0.0471	.967860187177413411	9366.304646092072	14291.45970178526	9674.8217596728	13667.52086487463	3.142861687467058	4.436679386847772	.7083815199231778	-0.3673	.775207359797270412	21715.21121914646	28322.27917087776	22032.7264946577	26280.21378843767	8.277213458023372	9.59018714458508	.8630919640287678	-0.0683	.953738811973690113	4617.493248737836	5749.479751991168	4845.003418532951	5456.10540573668	1.66018970721157	1.823929176980263	.9102270681146822	-0.0288	.980206871451967214	11960.39489090574	12718.27345241508	12301.68098643028	12122.15235813602	4.238777242911252	4.025940024995012	1.052866465122392	0.0536	1.03788335531010215	1934.578025050988	2267.49973170281	2133.84824377692	2056.753315100735	.7056670671317166	.7042045200587146	1.002076878280872	-0.0482	.967131849762183816	3480.566786538276	3541.225634371245	3688.386976038758	3311.162505817818	1.096184451663312	1.000323581734412	1.095829861136225	0.2019	1.15017272695459417	325.7116455114338	702.7006249441453	508.1882189275512	414.9282511836061	.160710701595942	.133417272673232	1.204571929674785	0.2403	1.18124292026659718	6446.903393389551	9521.239463553664	6696.466189147674	9038.555028387116	2.078022066997303	2.950341819413746	.7043326482794529	-0.3428	.788492304532624219	1805.639796393122	2048.722483055524	2003.432311911138	1843.139409261161	.646751220119384	.6041715596410828	1.070476108646353	0.1529	1.11178954423168720	2314.798156476382	2848.22936305244	2514.695645913446	2631.823871526872	.7804941114712628	.8431055854660915	.9257370902599164	0.0303	1.021210392988659!sample_table_end
