DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8720!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM417nnn/GSM417475/suppl/GSM417475_MR2287.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM417nnn/GSM417475/suppl/GSM417475_MR2288.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16663!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 346769#ID_REF = #F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	794.956	1012.33	871.499	931.486	.69122	.775787	.890993	0.0285	1.019942	3009.9	4155.96	3122.79	3926.15	2.79892	3.66248	.764213	-0.0388	.9734613	160.644	262.022	208.302	213.995	.173914	.178844	.972435	0.2093	1.156134	4193.23	6436.37	4306.28	6072.46	3.60738	5.16802	.698021	-0.2500	.8408835	201.009	300.089	250.125	249.13	.200954	.196021	1.02517	-0.1283	.9148796	142.311	290.511	189.554	240.192	.170779	.219687	.777375	-0.3985	.7586277	1703.27	1684.62	1801.76	1574.64	1.45807	1.27831	1.14063	0.0830	1.059218	1581	1458.1	1676.49	1357.41	1.30558	1.08956	1.19826	0.1663	1.122189	109.596	218.884	155.546	176.543	.114124	.129416	.881842	-0.1334	.91166410	1330.53	1051.31	1420.65	968.606	1.3182	.868313	1.51812	0.3148	1.2438211	1750.78	2569.22	1850.03	2418.65	1.70758	2.23299	.764705	-0.4359	.73922112	834.124	1069.98	911.727	986.399	.815202	.922932	.883275	-0.0554	.96233713	3419.04	3082.07	3531.33	2907.22	3.75525	3.21774	1.16705	0.2502	1.1893814	1048.29	1306.4	1131.44	1212	.884295	.962903	.918363	-0.1615	.89409315	8791.96	7044.52	8796.97	6644.56	7.29668	5.68484	1.28353	0.2689	1.2049316	383.28	506.813	441.721	446.542	.375081	.386477	.970512	-0.0158	.9891417	299.978	262.067	354.013	214.035	.342416	.216861	1.57897	0.6664	1.5871218	5870.85	7270.47	5968.69	6857.36	5.29053	6.16758	.857796	-0.2830	.82187219	9155.14	8646.97	9146.19	8151.54	7.58676	7.13238	1.06371	0.0099	1.006920	5189.04	5249.36	5299.66	4956.71	4.34789	4.16285	1.04445	-0.0336	.976972!sample_table_end
