Briefly, 2 ug of sample and reference genomic DNAs (for reference were used Human Genomic DNA: male Cat G1471, female Cat G1521, Promega, Madison, WI)  were separately digested with AluI/RsaI restriction enzyme mix (Promega). Fragmented DNA was labeled by direct enzymatic incorporation of fluorescent tags. Genomic DNA was labeled with Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP (Perkin Elmer) using the Random-Primed Bioprime DNA Labeling kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Briefly, 50 ul reaction mix containing dATP, dGTP and dTTP (120 ueach), dUTP (60 uM) and Cy3-dUTP (60 uM) or Cy5-dUTP (60 uM) was incubated with Klenow Fragment (40 units) at 37Â°C for 2 hrs. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed on Microcon YM-30 filters (Millipore) according to the manufacturerâs protocol. Dye incorporations of post-labeling products were measured by NanoDrop 1000 (ThermoScientific) and the parameters that predicted successful hybridization were a minimum Cy3 incorporation of 0.5 pmol/ul and Cy5 incorporation of 0.3 pmol/ul.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = reference!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: Normal Reference DNA!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Genomic DNA was extracted overnight with lysis buffer containing K proteinase (0.2 mg/ml) followed by standard phenol/chloroform extraction.

Briefly, fluorescent-labeled reference and tumor DNAs (3 ug each) were mixed with 50 ug of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and control targets (Agilent Technologies). Slides were hybridized in SureHyb gasket (Agilent Technologies) placed in rotisserie (20 RPM rotation speed) in hybridization oven at 65Â°C for 40 hrs. After hybridization, the slides were washed with Oligo aCGH Wash Buffer 1(Agilent Technologies) at room temperature for 5 min, with Oligo aCGH Wash Buffer 2 (Agilent Technologies) at 37Â°C for 1 min, with the Stabilization solution (Agilent) for 1 minute at room temperature, then dried immediately by rinsing slides into Drying solution (Agilent) for 30 seconds.!Sample_scan_protocol = Slides were scanned immediately after washing on the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2505B) using the following settings: Scan Area 61x21.6 mm, Scan resolution 5um, Dye channel 1 is set to Red & Green, Red PMT is set to 100%, Green PMT is set to 100% . Microarray performance was assessed by QC metric tool.!Sample_description = aCGH analysis!Sample_data_processing = The scanned TIFF images were loaded into the Feature Extraction (v9.5 Agilent technologies), Feature Extraction files were analyzed by CGH Analytics Software (v. 3.5.14 Agilent Technologies) applying Z-Score algorithm.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = Z-score data is not available for GEO submission.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2873!Sample_contact_name = PAOLA,,SCARUFFI!Sample_contact_email = paola.scaruffi@hsanmartino.it!Sample_contact_laboratory = Center of Physiopathology of Human Reproduction!Sample_contact_institute = "San Martino" Hospital!Sample_contact_address = LARGO R.
