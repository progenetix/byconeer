It was part of a set of five LNCaP arrays that were used to verify the compatability of a small number of cells with array CGH. Specifically, this sample represents a sample of a small number of cells.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = LNCaP DNA was amplified in the collection tube by ligation mediated pcr (as per method described in Klein CA, Schmidt-Kittler O, Schardt JA, Pantel K, Speicher MR and Riethmuller G. Comparative genomic hybridization, loss of heterozygosity, and DNA sequence analysis of single cells. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1999;96: 4494-4499).!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Array CGH bioprime kit (Invitrogen)!Sample_source_name_ch2 = normal female reference DNA!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Normal female genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood.

The samples were resuspended in hybridization mix (50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 3x SSC, 1.5% SDS) and heated to 70Â°C for 10 minutes, followed by 1-hour incubation at 37Â°C to allow blocking of repetitive sequences by human Cot-1 DNA. After incubation, samples were applied to the microarray under a coverslip and hybridized at 37Â°C for 18 hours. After hybridization, the arrays were then washed in 50% formamide and 2x SSC (pH 7.0) for 20 minutes at 45Â°C, followed by a 7-minute wash at room temperature in 0.1 mol/L NaPO4 (pH 8.0) and 0.1% NP40. After washing, the arrays were dried by centrifugation at 600 rpm for 5 minutes.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments, Inc., Union City, CA); fluorescence data were processed with GenePix 3.0 image analysis software (Axon Instruments, Inc.). For each spot, log2 ratio = log2(Cy5/Cy3) and average log2 intensity = [log2(Cy5) + log2(Cy3)]/2 were calculated, where Cy5 and Cy3 refer to the median foreground fluorescent signals of the tumor and reference DNA, respectively. Background subtraction was not used because it conferred no benefit in tests run on cell lines with varying numbers of X chromosome copies.!Sample_description = NA!Sample_data_processing = The log2 ratios on each array were normalized and corrected for intensity-based location adjustment with a block-level loess algorithm (as described in Yang YH, Dudoit S, Luu P, Speed TP Normalization for cDNA microarray Bittner ML Chen Y Dorsel AN Dougherty ER eds. .
