Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514161/suppl/GSM514161.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	0.742284AFFX-121907	1.29963AFFX-1258602	43.1892AFFX-1304348	1.77828AFFX-1329481	2.13768AFFX-1375402	3.07065AFFX-157566	1.94263AFFX-1693093	0.91308AFFX-1852733	10.4701AFFX-1944727	3.5453AFFX-1987483	4.36108AFFX-2126602	3.58118AFFX-2147527	3.67195AFFX-2208108	1.05038AFFX-2343975	9.35972AFFX-2389926	6.32633AFFX-2436931	1.16816AFFX-2472766	2.37217AFFX-2557092	0.950363AFFX-2629782	1.25011!sample_table_end
