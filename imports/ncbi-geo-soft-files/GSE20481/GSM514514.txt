Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514514/suppl/GSM514514.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	3.68189AFFX-121907	6.30505AFFX-1258602	6.77962AFFX-1304348	4.64433AFFX-1329481	2.30433AFFX-1375402	4.92894AFFX-157566	7.90894AFFX-1693093	1.7141AFFX-1852733	9.90144AFFX-1944727	5.20856AFFX-1987483	3.25086AFFX-2126602	8.11147AFFX-2147527	13.3143AFFX-2208108	5.15806AFFX-2343975	5.34645AFFX-2389926	2.38651AFFX-2436931	2.43973AFFX-2472766	4.74098AFFX-2557092	3.72258AFFX-2629782	5.69267!sample_table_end
