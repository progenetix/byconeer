Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM513nnn/GSM513865/suppl/GSM513865.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	0.930965AFFX-121907	1.77094AFFX-1258602	14.6529AFFX-1304348	1.25639AFFX-1329481	2.5975AFFX-1375402	6.58471AFFX-157566	4.96375AFFX-1693093	1.04608AFFX-1852733	5.61832AFFX-1944727	1.76036AFFX-1987483	2.06723AFFX-2126602	4.0588AFFX-2147527	6.5754AFFX-2208108	2.49436AFFX-2343975	3.4984AFFX-2389926	2.97238AFFX-2436931	1.10626AFFX-2472766	5.85716AFFX-2557092	3.98709AFFX-2629782	1.02067!sample_table_end
