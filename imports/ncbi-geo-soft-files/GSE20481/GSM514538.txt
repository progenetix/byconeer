Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514538/suppl/GSM514538.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.55765AFFX-121907	1.84906AFFX-1258602	2.86951AFFX-1304348	3.77945AFFX-1329481	2.09245AFFX-1375402	14.3534AFFX-157566	5.09327AFFX-1693093	1.79281AFFX-1852733	3.48227AFFX-1944727	1.76941AFFX-1987483	2.34784AFFX-2126602	2.10797AFFX-2147527	2.86318AFFX-2208108	1.61148AFFX-2343975	2.20355AFFX-2389926	1.86364AFFX-2436931	2.44556AFFX-2472766	2.61737AFFX-2557092	1.05011AFFX-2629782	1.68761!sample_table_end
