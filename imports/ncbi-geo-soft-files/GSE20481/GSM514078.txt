Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514078/suppl/GSM514078.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.63394AFFX-121907	1.72694AFFX-1258602	12.2699AFFX-1304348	1.29163AFFX-1329481	2.67693AFFX-1375402	4.40658AFFX-157566	3.52415AFFX-1693093	3.90431AFFX-1852733	4.08211AFFX-1944727	2.30202AFFX-1987483	2.85071AFFX-2126602	3.92903AFFX-2147527	2.94641AFFX-2208108	2.43211AFFX-2343975	4.81453AFFX-2389926	3.22448AFFX-2436931	2.53053AFFX-2472766	5.69262AFFX-2557092	2.95599AFFX-2629782	3.04009!sample_table_end
