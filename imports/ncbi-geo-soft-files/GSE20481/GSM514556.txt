Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514556/suppl/GSM514556.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	5.92667AFFX-121907	2.47123AFFX-1258602	7.4803AFFX-1304348	3.70741AFFX-1329481	6.17487AFFX-1375402	5.13578AFFX-157566	11.9235AFFX-1693093	2.52574AFFX-1852733	11.3325AFFX-1944727	4.34904AFFX-1987483	6.30961AFFX-2126602	6.63706AFFX-2147527	8.03856AFFX-2208108	4.4866AFFX-2343975	4.7153AFFX-2389926	4.66814AFFX-2436931	2.42747AFFX-2472766	2.61172AFFX-2557092	2.21993AFFX-2629782	4.67428!sample_table_end
