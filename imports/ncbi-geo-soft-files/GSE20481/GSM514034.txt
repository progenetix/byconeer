Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514034/suppl/GSM514034.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.25249AFFX-121907	0.952287AFFX-1258602	22.2332AFFX-1304348	1.17149AFFX-1329481	3.96592AFFX-1375402	10.3299AFFX-157566	3.23539AFFX-1693093	2.38422AFFX-1852733	3.60155AFFX-1944727	0.825638AFFX-1987483	1.64941AFFX-2126602	3.80118AFFX-2147527	5.11971AFFX-2208108	3.64536AFFX-2343975	6.16282AFFX-2389926	0.920573AFFX-2436931	3.91648AFFX-2472766	4.11395AFFX-2557092	4.52213AFFX-2629782	1.16614!sample_table_end
