Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514155/suppl/GSM514155.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	2.03306AFFX-121907	2.42357AFFX-1258602	6.66249AFFX-1304348	1.39795AFFX-1329481	1.22826AFFX-1375402	5.05851AFFX-157566	9.48634AFFX-1693093	4.40895AFFX-1852733	5.34961AFFX-1944727	2.20946AFFX-1987483	1.68489AFFX-2126602	3.27833AFFX-2147527	11.9286AFFX-2208108	2.22072AFFX-2343975	6.05236AFFX-2389926	2.04567AFFX-2436931	2.15208AFFX-2472766	5.05835AFFX-2557092	3.49562AFFX-2629782	2.39087!sample_table_end
