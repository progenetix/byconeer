Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514027/suppl/GSM514027.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.34059AFFX-121907	0.664092AFFX-1258602	15.2759AFFX-1304348	1.12068AFFX-1329481	4.58479AFFX-1375402	8.46987AFFX-157566	2.57115AFFX-1693093	2.89907AFFX-1852733	3.5678AFFX-1944727	1.17496AFFX-1987483	2.2009AFFX-2126602	2.86875AFFX-2147527	4.85256AFFX-2208108	4.54162AFFX-2343975	6.32537AFFX-2389926	1.12234AFFX-2436931	1.31097AFFX-2472766	3.55876AFFX-2557092	3.91389AFFX-2629782	1.24253!sample_table_end
