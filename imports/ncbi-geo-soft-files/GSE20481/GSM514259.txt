Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514259/suppl/GSM514259.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	2.06318AFFX-121907	8.21931AFFX-1258602	5.53892AFFX-1304348	4.25065AFFX-1329481	4.66749AFFX-1375402	11.9883AFFX-157566	3.96929AFFX-1693093	0.836129AFFX-1852733	5.87112AFFX-1944727	8.78338AFFX-1987483	5.12442AFFX-2126602	7.65629AFFX-2147527	9.29544AFFX-2208108	2.07414AFFX-2343975	4.2478AFFX-2389926	6.7333AFFX-2436931	2.73675AFFX-2472766	2.14565AFFX-2557092	1.89011AFFX-2629782	5.87779!sample_table_end
