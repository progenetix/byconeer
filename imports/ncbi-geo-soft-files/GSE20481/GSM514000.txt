Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514000/suppl/GSM514000.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.72974AFFX-121907	1.81377AFFX-1258602	5.51742AFFX-1304348	1.16579AFFX-1329481	1.03685AFFX-1375402	21.1736AFFX-157566	4.16916AFFX-1693093	2.73997AFFX-1852733	1.34195AFFX-1944727	0.846741AFFX-1987483	1.17397AFFX-2126602	5.47891AFFX-2147527	3.3792AFFX-2208108	2.28503AFFX-2343975	13.4726AFFX-2389926	3.23049AFFX-2436931	2.88116AFFX-2472766	1.56858AFFX-2557092	1.5568AFFX-2629782	2.83968!sample_table_end
