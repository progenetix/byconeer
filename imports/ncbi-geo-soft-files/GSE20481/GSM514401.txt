Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514401/suppl/GSM514401.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	2.36315AFFX-121907	5.24355AFFX-1258602	4.56687AFFX-1304348	7.73047AFFX-1329481	5.5856AFFX-1375402	9.66312AFFX-157566	2.96526AFFX-1693093	1.2637AFFX-1852733	8.69395AFFX-1944727	5.18747AFFX-1987483	5.29761AFFX-2126602	12.5138AFFX-2147527	8.40275AFFX-2208108	2.4892AFFX-2343975	4.69357AFFX-2389926	7.31221AFFX-2436931	4.3849AFFX-2472766	3.09154AFFX-2557092	2.0501AFFX-2629782	2.38617!sample_table_end
