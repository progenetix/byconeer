Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM513nnn/GSM513958/suppl/GSM513958.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	0.648478AFFX-121907	0.571195AFFX-1258602	14.9558AFFX-1304348	1.77191AFFX-1329481	3.08072AFFX-1375402	9.63115AFFX-157566	3.54884AFFX-1693093	3.37206AFFX-1852733	3.00602AFFX-1944727	2.32533AFFX-1987483	2.05781AFFX-2126602	9.76795AFFX-2147527	18.5121AFFX-2208108	2.3725AFFX-2343975	5.14965AFFX-2389926	3.50492AFFX-2436931	2.25645AFFX-2472766	2.25174AFFX-2557092	5.61707AFFX-2629782	1.70749!sample_table_end
