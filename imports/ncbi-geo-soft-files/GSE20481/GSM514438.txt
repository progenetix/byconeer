Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514438/suppl/GSM514438.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	3.56539AFFX-121907	1.41876AFFX-1258602	7.14388AFFX-1304348	4.21139AFFX-1329481	3.01896AFFX-1375402	6.4239AFFX-157566	7.30875AFFX-1693093	6.56371AFFX-1852733	7.24261AFFX-1944727	2.42693AFFX-1987483	2.88017AFFX-2126602	9.81237AFFX-2147527	5.37106AFFX-2208108	6.75845AFFX-2343975	2.94138AFFX-2389926	3.16194AFFX-2436931	3.2215AFFX-2472766	3.49008AFFX-2557092	3.58229AFFX-2629782	6.84851!sample_table_end
