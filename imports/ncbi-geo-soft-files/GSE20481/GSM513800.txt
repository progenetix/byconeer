Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM513nnn/GSM513800/suppl/GSM513800.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	0.556773AFFX-121907	1.668AFFX-1258602	11.5751AFFX-1304348	1.50905AFFX-1329481	2.45359AFFX-1375402	7.60363AFFX-157566	4.78034AFFX-1693093	2.45356AFFX-1852733	4.27761AFFX-1944727	2.3626AFFX-1987483	2.10346AFFX-2126602	4.30829AFFX-2147527	5.11222AFFX-2208108	2.27094AFFX-2343975	7.12071AFFX-2389926	2.75313AFFX-2436931	4.97493AFFX-2472766	9.11363AFFX-2557092	3.91956AFFX-2629782	3.47959!sample_table_end
