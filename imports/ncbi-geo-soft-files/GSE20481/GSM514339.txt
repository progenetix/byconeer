Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514339/suppl/GSM514339.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	3.79924AFFX-121907	2.54709AFFX-1258602	7.44611AFFX-1304348	3.11748AFFX-1329481	3.62466AFFX-1375402	5.75919AFFX-157566	4.11386AFFX-1693093	1.13903AFFX-1852733	4.63334AFFX-1944727	3.09962AFFX-1987483	0.884289AFFX-2126602	16.3605AFFX-2147527	4.482AFFX-2208108	2.77568AFFX-2343975	2.16123AFFX-2389926	2.17328AFFX-2436931	1.73394AFFX-2472766	4.69326AFFX-2557092	8.67196AFFX-2629782	2.47687!sample_table_end
