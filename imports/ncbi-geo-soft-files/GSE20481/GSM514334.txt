Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514334/suppl/GSM514334.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.66807AFFX-121907	5.07525AFFX-1258602	5.65601AFFX-1304348	2.98364AFFX-1329481	10.9512AFFX-1375402	3.70996AFFX-157566	27.532AFFX-1693093	3.05387AFFX-1852733	7.33199AFFX-1944727	10.9695AFFX-1987483	3.17244AFFX-2126602	9.77167AFFX-2147527	12.3175AFFX-2208108	2.77445AFFX-2343975	4.31751AFFX-2389926	3.8237AFFX-2436931	2.95443AFFX-2472766	1.78179AFFX-2557092	9.58929AFFX-2629782	2.48324!sample_table_end
