Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514560/suppl/GSM514560.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.54785AFFX-121907	2.42661AFFX-1258602	9.19306AFFX-1304348	5.18801AFFX-1329481	5.52946AFFX-1375402	3.70407AFFX-157566	2.74213AFFX-1693093	2.15996AFFX-1852733	8.07757AFFX-1944727	6.79146AFFX-1987483	5.97086AFFX-2126602	5.63928AFFX-2147527	0.406002AFFX-2208108	1.84151AFFX-2343975	0.346086AFFX-2389926	0.627099AFFX-2436931	0.567478AFFX-2472766	1.6605AFFX-2557092	2.96941AFFX-2629782	4.48121!sample_table_end
