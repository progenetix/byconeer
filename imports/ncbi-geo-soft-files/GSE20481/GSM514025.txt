Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514025/suppl/GSM514025.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.34841AFFX-121907	0.763685AFFX-1258602	16.361AFFX-1304348	0.880293AFFX-1329481	7.65299AFFX-1375402	4.91018AFFX-157566	2.82087AFFX-1693093	4.77392AFFX-1852733	3.46611AFFX-1944727	0.824391AFFX-1987483	2.07635AFFX-2126602	3.49288AFFX-2147527	3.6517AFFX-2208108	4.63553AFFX-2343975	7.81985AFFX-2389926	1.66003AFFX-2436931	1.60659AFFX-2472766	2.99072AFFX-2557092	4.11618AFFX-2629782	0.994186!sample_table_end
