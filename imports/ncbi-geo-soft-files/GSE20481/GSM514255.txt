Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514255/suppl/GSM514255.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	2.29669AFFX-121907	7.57143AFFX-1258602	5.05904AFFX-1304348	6.021AFFX-1329481	3.4235AFFX-1375402	10.1231AFFX-157566	4.58804AFFX-1693093	1.62808AFFX-1852733	7.70773AFFX-1944727	11.1167AFFX-1987483	3.0105AFFX-2126602	7.02164AFFX-2147527	10.4366AFFX-2208108	6.29372AFFX-2343975	4.68536AFFX-2389926	4.50155AFFX-2436931	0.956009AFFX-2472766	2.34243AFFX-2557092	4.47229AFFX-2629782	11.1808!sample_table_end
