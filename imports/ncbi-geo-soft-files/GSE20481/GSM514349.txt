Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514349/suppl/GSM514349.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.12174AFFX-121907	4.44742AFFX-1258602	11.9585AFFX-1304348	5.27928AFFX-1329481	3.91566AFFX-1375402	7.78019AFFX-157566	6.78443AFFX-1693093	2.745AFFX-1852733	7.64195AFFX-1944727	1.23478AFFX-1987483	5.50735AFFX-2126602	10.3378AFFX-2147527	5.38447AFFX-2208108	6.66508AFFX-2343975	1.63274AFFX-2389926	0.810392AFFX-2436931	2.83736AFFX-2472766	4.07887AFFX-2557092	3.80416AFFX-2629782	2.94112!sample_table_end
