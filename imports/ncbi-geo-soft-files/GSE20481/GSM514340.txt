Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514340/suppl/GSM514340.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	2.23046AFFX-121907	2.59803AFFX-1258602	15.808AFFX-1304348	3.80057AFFX-1329481	3.21774AFFX-1375402	3.43036AFFX-157566	3.18098AFFX-1693093	1.65496AFFX-1852733	23.9603AFFX-1944727	2.97044AFFX-1987483	2.45961AFFX-2126602	3.91775AFFX-2147527	9.18074AFFX-2208108	6.00341AFFX-2343975	4.254AFFX-2389926	0.561041AFFX-2436931	1.5863AFFX-2472766	1.81639AFFX-2557092	5.58777AFFX-2629782	6.22629!sample_table_end
