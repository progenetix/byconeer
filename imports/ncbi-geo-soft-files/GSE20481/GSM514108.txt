Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514108/suppl/GSM514108.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.29761AFFX-121907	1.113AFFX-1258602	9.91724AFFX-1304348	1.37728AFFX-1329481	0.991488AFFX-1375402	13.7885AFFX-157566	5.35226AFFX-1693093	1.41932AFFX-1852733	2.71912AFFX-1944727	2.01224AFFX-1987483	1.83473AFFX-2126602	24.3698AFFX-2147527	11.4836AFFX-2208108	4.0965AFFX-2343975	6.49404AFFX-2389926	6.48079AFFX-2436931	1.51876AFFX-2472766	4.88636AFFX-2557092	2.81937AFFX-2629782	1.45877!sample_table_end
