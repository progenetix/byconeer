Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514260/suppl/GSM514260.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	2.15968AFFX-121907	7.4577AFFX-1258602	5.11609AFFX-1304348	3.92249AFFX-1329481	2.30013AFFX-1375402	12.3397AFFX-157566	6.94261AFFX-1693093	1.7023AFFX-1852733	5.02014AFFX-1944727	9.26271AFFX-1987483	4.79253AFFX-2126602	11.1093AFFX-2147527	7.57041AFFX-2208108	7.16596AFFX-2343975	4.16211AFFX-2389926	7.22042AFFX-2436931	2.12395AFFX-2472766	7.10893AFFX-2557092	3.25526AFFX-2629782	3.93684!sample_table_end
