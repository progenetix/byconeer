Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514331/suppl/GSM514331.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.94587AFFX-121907	1.45688AFFX-1258602	11.5472AFFX-1304348	6.53082AFFX-1329481	6.90684AFFX-1375402	5.24408AFFX-157566	12.5102AFFX-1693093	0.3795AFFX-1852733	5.92361AFFX-1944727	0.304795AFFX-1987483	2.75081AFFX-2126602	21.0245AFFX-2147527	17.9801AFFX-2208108	4.30352AFFX-2343975	6.41343AFFX-2389926	3.40075AFFX-2436931	0.974411AFFX-2472766	5.10286AFFX-2557092	8.33413AFFX-2629782	1.55475!sample_table_end
