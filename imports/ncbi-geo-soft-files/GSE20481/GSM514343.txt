Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514343/suppl/GSM514343.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	0.867603AFFX-121907	1.5645AFFX-1258602	5.94237AFFX-1304348	4.36463AFFX-1329481	4.71943AFFX-1375402	7.38303AFFX-157566	8.31906AFFX-1693093	3.06339AFFX-1852733	3.51918AFFX-1944727	4.42015AFFX-1987483	2.96376AFFX-2126602	26.1364AFFX-2147527	10.331AFFX-2208108	5.09557AFFX-2343975	3.3296AFFX-2389926	2.88384AFFX-2436931	1.72531AFFX-2472766	1.9757AFFX-2557092	5.04112AFFX-2629782	3.13525!sample_table_end
