Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514524/suppl/GSM514524.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	3.25414AFFX-121907	1.85162AFFX-1258602	13.0743AFFX-1304348	4.20925AFFX-1329481	7.88738AFFX-1375402	9.69005AFFX-157566	4.12208AFFX-1693093	2.96389AFFX-1852733	9.80567AFFX-1944727	3.50438AFFX-1987483	5.69531AFFX-2126602	12.4551AFFX-2147527	7.67284AFFX-2208108	9.90443AFFX-2343975	7.28354AFFX-2389926	1.37912AFFX-2436931	1.74631AFFX-2472766	2.61064AFFX-2557092	3.73791AFFX-2629782	2.4624!sample_table_end
