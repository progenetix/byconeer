Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514180/suppl/GSM514180.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.16759AFFX-121907	1.61665AFFX-1258602	7.50792AFFX-1304348	2.07015AFFX-1329481	1.69054AFFX-1375402	2.56751AFFX-157566	3.35076AFFX-1693093	1.45777AFFX-1852733	5.57777AFFX-1944727	1.28494AFFX-1987483	2.7519AFFX-2126602	2.54166AFFX-2147527	4.93304AFFX-2208108	2.43718AFFX-2343975	5.6318AFFX-2389926	3.81511AFFX-2436931	2.27589AFFX-2472766	5.00258AFFX-2557092	1.60934AFFX-2629782	2.34854!sample_table_end
