Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514424/suppl/GSM514424.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	2.44367AFFX-121907	1.90926AFFX-1258602	3.69036AFFX-1304348	3.33702AFFX-1329481	2.73092AFFX-1375402	9.55026AFFX-157566	4.80271AFFX-1693093	2.44744AFFX-1852733	5.56309AFFX-1944727	4.33211AFFX-1987483	2.09784AFFX-2126602	4.01914AFFX-2147527	5.55733AFFX-2208108	1.6291AFFX-2343975	5.00522AFFX-2389926	2.77982AFFX-2436931	2.42628AFFX-2472766	2.40766AFFX-2557092	1.71627AFFX-2629782	1.30657!sample_table_end
