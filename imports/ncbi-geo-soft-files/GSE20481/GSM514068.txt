Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514068/suppl/GSM514068.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.1456AFFX-121907	3.25388AFFX-1258602	11.2387AFFX-1304348	2.19294AFFX-1329481	2.90948AFFX-1375402	3.84886AFFX-157566	8.17699AFFX-1693093	1.42083AFFX-1852733	4.88854AFFX-1944727	7.82498AFFX-1987483	1.4543AFFX-2126602	4.35752AFFX-2147527	4.66642AFFX-2208108	2.05715AFFX-2343975	5.84991AFFX-2389926	2.47828AFFX-2436931	0.699135AFFX-2472766	1.30375AFFX-2557092	2.32328AFFX-2629782	1.26653!sample_table_end
