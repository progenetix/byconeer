Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514065/suppl/GSM514065.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.393AFFX-121907	2.27027AFFX-1258602	19.2778AFFX-1304348	1.95129AFFX-1329481	2.88922AFFX-1375402	5.20779AFFX-157566	6.85504AFFX-1693093	3.43033AFFX-1852733	3.24992AFFX-1944727	2.23161AFFX-1987483	1.72236AFFX-2126602	4.10182AFFX-2147527	5.65956AFFX-2208108	2.79115AFFX-2343975	5.48844AFFX-2389926	2.62209AFFX-2436931	1.53958AFFX-2472766	4.25315AFFX-2557092	2.22915AFFX-2629782	3.77373!sample_table_end
