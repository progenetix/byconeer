Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM513nnn/GSM513920/suppl/GSM513920.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	0.69963AFFX-121907	0.578997AFFX-1258602	5.56377AFFX-1304348	2.30164AFFX-1329481	2.10302AFFX-1375402	2.12753AFFX-157566	3.50534AFFX-1693093	0.955111AFFX-1852733	9.88533AFFX-1944727	1.57355AFFX-1987483	1.7501AFFX-2126602	3.75361AFFX-2147527	8.21555AFFX-2208108	3.21861AFFX-2343975	2.60993AFFX-2389926	1.122AFFX-2436931	1.58661AFFX-2472766	6.2126AFFX-2557092	4.5491AFFX-2629782	0.727799!sample_table_end
