Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM513nnn/GSM513889/suppl/GSM513889.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.4226AFFX-121907	0.732057AFFX-1258602	12.6149AFFX-1304348	1.78524AFFX-1329481	2.28926AFFX-1375402	3.53666AFFX-157566	2.75122AFFX-1693093	1.69073AFFX-1852733	3.94545AFFX-1944727	1.30772AFFX-1987483	2.48952AFFX-2126602	1.65511AFFX-2147527	3.45921AFFX-2208108	1.5908AFFX-2343975	4.68588AFFX-2389926	4.20716AFFX-2436931	1.96997AFFX-2472766	4.06232AFFX-2557092	1.84127AFFX-2629782	1.91472!sample_table_end
