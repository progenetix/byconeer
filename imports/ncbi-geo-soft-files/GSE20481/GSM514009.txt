Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514009/suppl/GSM514009.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	2.02381AFFX-121907	1.30766AFFX-1258602	4.34457AFFX-1304348	2.88595AFFX-1329481	1.57601AFFX-1375402	5.97558AFFX-157566	4.37145AFFX-1693093	1.57489AFFX-1852733	4.47154AFFX-1944727	2.55235AFFX-1987483	1.47881AFFX-2126602	4.78532AFFX-2147527	4.95276AFFX-2208108	1.88439AFFX-2343975	2.32449AFFX-2389926	3.24595AFFX-2436931	1.74927AFFX-2472766	3.7656AFFX-2557092	1.13686AFFX-2629782	4.35117!sample_table_end
