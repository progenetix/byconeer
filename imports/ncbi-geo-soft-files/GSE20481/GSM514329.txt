Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514329/suppl/GSM514329.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	0.538682AFFX-121907	1.67685AFFX-1258602	25.1631AFFX-1304348	4.43628AFFX-1329481	6.9432AFFX-1375402	2.22965AFFX-157566	5.9145AFFX-1693093	2.23413AFFX-1852733	17.8482AFFX-1944727	3.22243AFFX-1987483	2.3942AFFX-2126602	2.64985AFFX-2147527	9.08154AFFX-2208108	1.72172AFFX-2343975	1.48883AFFX-2389926	0.850875AFFX-2436931	0.55272AFFX-2472766	3.44741AFFX-2557092	5.30681AFFX-2629782	4.28559!sample_table_end
