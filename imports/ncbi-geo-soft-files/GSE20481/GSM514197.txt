Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514197/suppl/GSM514197.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.5336AFFX-121907	4.61984AFFX-1258602	5.76554AFFX-1304348	4.55389AFFX-1329481	4.72542AFFX-1375402	13.4692AFFX-157566	3.21493AFFX-1693093	1.59626AFFX-1852733	6.10091AFFX-1944727	6.46542AFFX-1987483	5.43141AFFX-2126602	6.18211AFFX-2147527	5.64371AFFX-2208108	4.77641AFFX-2343975	3.13636AFFX-2389926	4.16161AFFX-2436931	1.01271AFFX-2472766	3.29089AFFX-2557092	1.28857AFFX-2629782	6.10555!sample_table_end
