Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514079/suppl/GSM514079.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.02216AFFX-121907	2.4653AFFX-1258602	11.8587AFFX-1304348	0.944176AFFX-1329481	3.19702AFFX-1375402	5.02468AFFX-157566	4.09844AFFX-1693093	1.78976AFFX-1852733	5.08781AFFX-1944727	3.03609AFFX-1987483	2.42377AFFX-2126602	5.80207AFFX-2147527	5.55636AFFX-2208108	2.37568AFFX-2343975	8.21853AFFX-2389926	8.5922AFFX-2436931	3.12631AFFX-2472766	8.07374AFFX-2557092	3.46786AFFX-2629782	1.32077!sample_table_end
