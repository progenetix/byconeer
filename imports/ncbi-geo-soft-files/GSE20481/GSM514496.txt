Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514496/suppl/GSM514496.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	2.46445AFFX-121907	1.39499AFFX-1258602	7.52351AFFX-1304348	6.86867AFFX-1329481	4.7373AFFX-1375402	9.89429AFFX-157566	9.84782AFFX-1693093	2.77712AFFX-1852733	8.87494AFFX-1944727	2.03409AFFX-1987483	4.12956AFFX-2126602	5.4288AFFX-2147527	9.04602AFFX-2208108	2.68943AFFX-2343975	3.31274AFFX-2389926	3.40765AFFX-2436931	2.09753AFFX-2472766	4.23904AFFX-2557092	4.10676AFFX-2629782	3.17931!sample_table_end
