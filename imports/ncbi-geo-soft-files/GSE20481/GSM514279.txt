Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514279/suppl/GSM514279.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.85826AFFX-121907	5.15133AFFX-1258602	8.02043AFFX-1304348	4.05801AFFX-1329481	3.83301AFFX-1375402	5.12178AFFX-157566	7.13017AFFX-1693093	1.18735AFFX-1852733	8.13055AFFX-1944727	5.72429AFFX-1987483	5.84627AFFX-2126602	8.91436AFFX-2147527	5.24863AFFX-2208108	6.76872AFFX-2343975	6.19875AFFX-2389926	3.63183AFFX-2436931	1.85928AFFX-2472766	5.09258AFFX-2557092	4.00674AFFX-2629782	3.88526!sample_table_end
