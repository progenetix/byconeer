Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514546/suppl/GSM514546.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	2.34355AFFX-121907	2.68167AFFX-1258602	2.79724AFFX-1304348	2.08758AFFX-1329481	1.47278AFFX-1375402	9.85005AFFX-157566	4.17824AFFX-1693093	2.36517AFFX-1852733	3.02609AFFX-1944727	3.87588AFFX-1987483	2.19263AFFX-2126602	5.91547AFFX-2147527	3.83919AFFX-2208108	2.5744AFFX-2343975	3.16505AFFX-2389926	2.99263AFFX-2436931	1.45202AFFX-2472766	3.02156AFFX-2557092	1.17278AFFX-2629782	2.31507!sample_table_end
