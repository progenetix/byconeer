Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM513nnn/GSM513996/suppl/GSM513996.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.46296AFFX-121907	1.13786AFFX-1258602	3.94015AFFX-1304348	0.922114AFFX-1329481	0.490074AFFX-1375402	15.8915AFFX-157566	2.91046AFFX-1693093	4.06548AFFX-1852733	2.04535AFFX-1944727	0.579992AFFX-1987483	0.989549AFFX-2126602	11.9833AFFX-2147527	2.71571AFFX-2208108	1.73006AFFX-2343975	19.6941AFFX-2389926	0.788609AFFX-2436931	3.02342AFFX-2472766	3.96461AFFX-2557092	1.61871AFFX-2629782	3.87737!sample_table_end
