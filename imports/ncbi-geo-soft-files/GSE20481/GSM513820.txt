Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM513nnn/GSM513820/suppl/GSM513820.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.64839AFFX-121907	1.13519AFFX-1258602	9.03421AFFX-1304348	1.16381AFFX-1329481	3.82626AFFX-1375402	4.18462AFFX-157566	3.34558AFFX-1693093	1.38125AFFX-1852733	3.94209AFFX-1944727	1.49434AFFX-1987483	1.66158AFFX-2126602	2.38193AFFX-2147527	6.49208AFFX-2208108	2.86597AFFX-2343975	1.57469AFFX-2389926	2.41758AFFX-2436931	3.16308AFFX-2472766	3.15306AFFX-2557092	3.82393AFFX-2629782	1.19001!sample_table_end
