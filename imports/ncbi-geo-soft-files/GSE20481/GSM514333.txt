Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514333/suppl/GSM514333.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	0.850504AFFX-121907	2.44097AFFX-1258602	8.41348AFFX-1304348	3.51013AFFX-1329481	5.14621AFFX-1375402	5.60236AFFX-157566	3.07911AFFX-1693093	1.96363AFFX-1852733	10.9261AFFX-1944727	3.07907AFFX-1987483	4.0154AFFX-2126602	7.24359AFFX-2147527	5.41866AFFX-2208108	4.13032AFFX-2343975	1.5377AFFX-2389926	1.04011AFFX-2436931	0.700125AFFX-2472766	1.88515AFFX-2557092	4.3334AFFX-2629782	1.98221!sample_table_end
