Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514001/suppl/GSM514001.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	2.03738AFFX-121907	0.79964AFFX-1258602	9.29899AFFX-1304348	1.15942AFFX-1329481	1.01107AFFX-1375402	6.8042AFFX-157566	1.21147AFFX-1693093	3.84505AFFX-1852733	3.49801AFFX-1944727	0.588815AFFX-1987483	1.18635AFFX-2126602	8.95026AFFX-2147527	4.98139AFFX-2208108	1.61116AFFX-2343975	2.64965AFFX-2389926	2.05194AFFX-2436931	1.15515AFFX-2472766	2.33659AFFX-2557092	0.800485AFFX-2629782	3.31359!sample_table_end
