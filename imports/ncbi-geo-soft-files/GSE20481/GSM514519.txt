Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514519/suppl/GSM514519.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	4.13826AFFX-121907	1.24399AFFX-1258602	24.1492AFFX-1304348	3.78027AFFX-1329481	9.17124AFFX-1375402	13.9044AFFX-157566	1.60356AFFX-1693093	4.86666AFFX-1852733	8.10336AFFX-1944727	2.99067AFFX-1987483	5.78047AFFX-2126602	11.3341AFFX-2147527	4.90066AFFX-2208108	8.8396AFFX-2343975	10.9201AFFX-2389926	1.04641AFFX-2436931	1.94949AFFX-2472766	2.72494AFFX-2557092	3.78093AFFX-2629782	6.90053!sample_table_end
