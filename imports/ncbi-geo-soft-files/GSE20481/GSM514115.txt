Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514115/suppl/GSM514115.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.22117AFFX-121907	1.23784AFFX-1258602	10.898AFFX-1304348	1.83519AFFX-1329481	1.34872AFFX-1375402	8.20082AFFX-157566	8.08842AFFX-1693093	1.6229AFFX-1852733	4.0716AFFX-1944727	2.147AFFX-1987483	2.40741AFFX-2126602	4.29439AFFX-2147527	8.52168AFFX-2208108	1.39594AFFX-2343975	4.93889AFFX-2389926	2.37502AFFX-2436931	2.0188AFFX-2472766	2.61775AFFX-2557092	6.10118AFFX-2629782	1.441!sample_table_end
