Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514537/suppl/GSM514537.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	2.00397AFFX-121907	2.96536AFFX-1258602	4.05688AFFX-1304348	2.50339AFFX-1329481	1.58413AFFX-1375402	7.24803AFFX-157566	4.4097AFFX-1693093	1.4323AFFX-1852733	5.48511AFFX-1944727	2.91906AFFX-1987483	2.36938AFFX-2126602	1.77226AFFX-2147527	4.76341AFFX-2208108	1.73206AFFX-2343975	1.24149AFFX-2389926	1.80956AFFX-2436931	1.19689AFFX-2472766	2.81406AFFX-2557092	1.5024AFFX-2629782	2.13368!sample_table_end
