Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM513nnn/GSM513942/suppl/GSM513942.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.2481AFFX-121907	2.62091AFFX-1258602	10.808AFFX-1304348	6.07144AFFX-1329481	6.91836AFFX-1375402	4.71468AFFX-157566	4.61022AFFX-1693093	1.8717AFFX-1852733	7.82918AFFX-1944727	1.07005AFFX-1987483	2.06759AFFX-2126602	0.819292AFFX-2147527	10.425AFFX-2208108	1.61066AFFX-2343975	0.975912AFFX-2389926	1.36644AFFX-2436931	0.519382AFFX-2472766	1.03456AFFX-2557092	9.56557AFFX-2629782	1.92683!sample_table_end
