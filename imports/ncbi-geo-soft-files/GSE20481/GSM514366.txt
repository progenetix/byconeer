Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514366/suppl/GSM514366.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.88432AFFX-121907	5.36225AFFX-1258602	3.74877AFFX-1304348	5.62922AFFX-1329481	3.85538AFFX-1375402	5.11392AFFX-157566	4.62687AFFX-1693093	1.47388AFFX-1852733	5.38553AFFX-1944727	5.05639AFFX-1987483	4.71133AFFX-2126602	7.05131AFFX-2147527	8.15712AFFX-2208108	3.1127AFFX-2343975	2.85103AFFX-2389926	2.47156AFFX-2436931	1.56688AFFX-2472766	1.68292AFFX-2557092	2.93398AFFX-2629782	1.4283!sample_table_end
