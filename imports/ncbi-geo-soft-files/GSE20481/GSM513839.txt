Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM513nnn/GSM513839/suppl/GSM513839.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	0.930237AFFX-121907	2.3446AFFX-1258602	10.7881AFFX-1304348	0.948383AFFX-1329481	3.81418AFFX-1375402	3.19744AFFX-157566	4.11974AFFX-1693093	1.46923AFFX-1852733	3.58281AFFX-1944727	4.06062AFFX-1987483	5.3882AFFX-2126602	3.11733AFFX-2147527	6.4929AFFX-2208108	1.68481AFFX-2343975	8.15241AFFX-2389926	2.94108AFFX-2436931	4.09409AFFX-2472766	5.8799AFFX-2557092	7.2849AFFX-2629782	2.51242!sample_table_end
