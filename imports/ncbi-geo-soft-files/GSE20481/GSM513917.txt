Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM513nnn/GSM513917/suppl/GSM513917.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.07659AFFX-121907	0.836459AFFX-1258602	6.38375AFFX-1304348	2.10972AFFX-1329481	3.6426AFFX-1375402	4.06742AFFX-157566	3.95658AFFX-1693093	1.28901AFFX-1852733	6.0446AFFX-1944727	0.8716AFFX-1987483	2.09867AFFX-2126602	3.42754AFFX-2147527	4.69724AFFX-2208108	1.81704AFFX-2343975	1.77799AFFX-2389926	1.69492AFFX-2436931	1.05322AFFX-2472766	2.43028AFFX-2557092	3.60146AFFX-2629782	2.00324!sample_table_end
