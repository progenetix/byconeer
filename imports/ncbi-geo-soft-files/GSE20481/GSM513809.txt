Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM513nnn/GSM513809/suppl/GSM513809.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	0.692694AFFX-121907	1.45585AFFX-1258602	10.2821AFFX-1304348	1.24349AFFX-1329481	1.33364AFFX-1375402	8.04794AFFX-157566	5.0359AFFX-1693093	2.89117AFFX-1852733	3.94295AFFX-1944727	1.29634AFFX-1987483	1.62167AFFX-2126602	2.98297AFFX-2147527	2.98137AFFX-2208108	1.05296AFFX-2343975	4.59398AFFX-2389926	4.23809AFFX-2436931	1.85019AFFX-2472766	5.50013AFFX-2557092	0.720737AFFX-2629782	1.33497!sample_table_end
