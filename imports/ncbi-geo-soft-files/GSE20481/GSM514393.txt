Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514393/suppl/GSM514393.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	3.72038AFFX-121907	4.01142AFFX-1258602	3.42605AFFX-1304348	5.50864AFFX-1329481	4.47686AFFX-1375402	8.44783AFFX-157566	4.42942AFFX-1693093	2.10859AFFX-1852733	6.48777AFFX-1944727	8.74467AFFX-1987483	6.69157AFFX-2126602	6.60851AFFX-2147527	7.85518AFFX-2208108	5.55933AFFX-2343975	7.55651AFFX-2389926	8.17293AFFX-2436931	5.54901AFFX-2472766	3.42651AFFX-2557092	3.3673AFFX-2629782	8.78258!sample_table_end
