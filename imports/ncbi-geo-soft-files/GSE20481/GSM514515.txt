Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514515/suppl/GSM514515.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	2.8073AFFX-121907	4.01205AFFX-1258602	10.6397AFFX-1304348	4.91523AFFX-1329481	3.87091AFFX-1375402	8.29333AFFX-157566	6.60471AFFX-1693093	1.68592AFFX-1852733	11.1899AFFX-1944727	3.96399AFFX-1987483	4.01565AFFX-2126602	4.4777AFFX-2147527	7.66795AFFX-2208108	5.50043AFFX-2343975	4.79267AFFX-2389926	5.56609AFFX-2436931	1.33223AFFX-2472766	5.73778AFFX-2557092	3.52841AFFX-2629782	3.60306!sample_table_end
