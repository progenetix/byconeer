Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM513nnn/GSM513986/suppl/GSM513986.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.80505AFFX-121907	1.74951AFFX-1258602	5.92733AFFX-1304348	2.62569AFFX-1329481	0.725715AFFX-1375402	10.3992AFFX-157566	4.14941AFFX-1693093	1.45272AFFX-1852733	5.02407AFFX-1944727	1.77827AFFX-1987483	1.34871AFFX-2126602	2.42352AFFX-2147527	6.35757AFFX-2208108	1.8494AFFX-2343975	0.83709AFFX-2389926	2.65863AFFX-2436931	0.73041AFFX-2472766	3.04644AFFX-2557092	0.768912AFFX-2629782	1.74891!sample_table_end
