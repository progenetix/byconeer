Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514311/suppl/GSM514311.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.64048AFFX-121907	2.10072AFFX-1258602	6.75515AFFX-1304348	3.78026AFFX-1329481	3.41987AFFX-1375402	3.46409AFFX-157566	2.38564AFFX-1693093	1.92894AFFX-1852733	9.12592AFFX-1944727	3.30309AFFX-1987483	4.36014AFFX-2126602	1.55797AFFX-2147527	3.41757AFFX-2208108	3.42935AFFX-2343975	2.27449AFFX-2389926	1.79899AFFX-2436931	3.05581AFFX-2472766	2.93667AFFX-2557092	4.6885AFFX-2629782	4.85937!sample_table_end
