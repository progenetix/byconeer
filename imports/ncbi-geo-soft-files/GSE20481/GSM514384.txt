Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514384/suppl/GSM514384.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.77569AFFX-121907	8.77558AFFX-1258602	8.10194AFFX-1304348	4.60868AFFX-1329481	5.16573AFFX-1375402	9.39945AFFX-157566	14.7146AFFX-1693093	2.7404AFFX-1852733	4.85195AFFX-1944727	2.8901AFFX-1987483	2.88515AFFX-2126602	3.46281AFFX-2147527	6.40313AFFX-2208108	5.41984AFFX-2343975	9.78616AFFX-2389926	2.81997AFFX-2436931	3.20568AFFX-2472766	3.76161AFFX-2557092	3.44247AFFX-2629782	2.0844!sample_table_end
