Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514019/suppl/GSM514019.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	4.299AFFX-121907	0.721485AFFX-1258602	1.76524AFFX-1304348	0.519852AFFX-1329481	0.422718AFFX-1375402	5.52667AFFX-157566	2.15965AFFX-1693093	0.50465AFFX-1852733	1.33556AFFX-1944727	0.200371AFFX-1987483	0.407735AFFX-2126602	0.527433AFFX-2147527	1.86012AFFX-2208108	2.86554AFFX-2343975	1.44208AFFX-2389926	0.893281AFFX-2436931	0.813322AFFX-2472766	1.31703AFFX-2557092	0.28994AFFX-2629782	1.74456!sample_table_end
