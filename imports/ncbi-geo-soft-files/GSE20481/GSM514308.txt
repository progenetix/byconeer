Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514308/suppl/GSM514308.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.22919AFFX-121907	1.92233AFFX-1258602	9.18853AFFX-1304348	4.81064AFFX-1329481	8.06066AFFX-1375402	4.15727AFFX-157566	2.84667AFFX-1693093	3.26667AFFX-1852733	16.6861AFFX-1944727	2.15874AFFX-1987483	3.4726AFFX-2126602	8.3205AFFX-2147527	6.43017AFFX-2208108	2.80851AFFX-2343975	2.76508AFFX-2389926	2.04175AFFX-2436931	0.594192AFFX-2472766	4.68158AFFX-2557092	4.36486AFFX-2629782	3.47502!sample_table_end
