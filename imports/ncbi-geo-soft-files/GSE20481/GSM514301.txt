Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514301/suppl/GSM514301.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.40654AFFX-121907	3.27663AFFX-1258602	5.29548AFFX-1304348	3.14333AFFX-1329481	3.28825AFFX-1375402	4.60392AFFX-157566	8.14714AFFX-1693093	1.35139AFFX-1852733	7.26595AFFX-1944727	3.53872AFFX-1987483	3.31432AFFX-2126602	7.90132AFFX-2147527	8.02874AFFX-2208108	7.06988AFFX-2343975	3.04388AFFX-2389926	2.69884AFFX-2436931	0.777013AFFX-2472766	3.58772AFFX-2557092	3.43048AFFX-2629782	4.61642!sample_table_end
