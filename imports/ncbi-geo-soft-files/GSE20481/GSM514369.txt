Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514369/suppl/GSM514369.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	2.23941AFFX-121907	4.69275AFFX-1258602	3.46739AFFX-1304348	4.11116AFFX-1329481	3.33923AFFX-1375402	8.81704AFFX-157566	1.93276AFFX-1693093	1.89623AFFX-1852733	2.88677AFFX-1944727	6.46611AFFX-1987483	5.21446AFFX-2126602	3.62526AFFX-2147527	9.39515AFFX-2208108	4.8096AFFX-2343975	4.53583AFFX-2389926	4.57015AFFX-2436931	3.09113AFFX-2472766	1.70637AFFX-2557092	3.52974AFFX-2629782	5.37156!sample_table_end
