Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514249/suppl/GSM514249.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	2.36189AFFX-121907	5.74292AFFX-1258602	7.47219AFFX-1304348	4.28299AFFX-1329481	2.31406AFFX-1375402	9.75404AFFX-157566	5.71754AFFX-1693093	1.30199AFFX-1852733	5.11191AFFX-1944727	7.06765AFFX-1987483	4.35753AFFX-2126602	9.41505AFFX-2147527	8.35364AFFX-2208108	7.4053AFFX-2343975	5.61698AFFX-2389926	8.82212AFFX-2436931	2.81617AFFX-2472766	6.08984AFFX-2557092	3.24522AFFX-2629782	7.21557!sample_table_end
