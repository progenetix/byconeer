Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514204/suppl/GSM514204.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.17226AFFX-121907	4.07086AFFX-1258602	8.87505AFFX-1304348	5.21824AFFX-1329481	4.106AFFX-1375402	5.79492AFFX-157566	5.13414AFFX-1693093	0.748011AFFX-1852733	10.3976AFFX-1944727	4.58916AFFX-1987483	2.07015AFFX-2126602	4.93784AFFX-2147527	4.75508AFFX-2208108	3.87357AFFX-2343975	3.33661AFFX-2389926	7.44732AFFX-2436931	2.2734AFFX-2472766	5.54732AFFX-2557092	3.62697AFFX-2629782	4.84213!sample_table_end
