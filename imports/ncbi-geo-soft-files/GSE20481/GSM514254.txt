Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514254/suppl/GSM514254.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.59692AFFX-121907	6.32057AFFX-1258602	7.75765AFFX-1304348	5.87614AFFX-1329481	3.98384AFFX-1375402	13.7908AFFX-157566	7.2485AFFX-1693093	1.881AFFX-1852733	9.90074AFFX-1944727	5.48811AFFX-1987483	5.23211AFFX-2126602	8.58103AFFX-2147527	7.10125AFFX-2208108	6.58344AFFX-2343975	5.31809AFFX-2389926	6.12408AFFX-2436931	4.8752AFFX-2472766	5.49365AFFX-2557092	4.60494AFFX-2629782	4.11015!sample_table_end
