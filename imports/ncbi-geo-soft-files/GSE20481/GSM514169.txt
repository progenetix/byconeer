Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514169/suppl/GSM514169.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.20294AFFX-121907	1.76798AFFX-1258602	9.68389AFFX-1304348	1.32562AFFX-1329481	2.16102AFFX-1375402	6.14071AFFX-157566	5.08224AFFX-1693093	1.3853AFFX-1852733	8.18577AFFX-1944727	1.5145AFFX-1987483	3.89169AFFX-2126602	3.94512AFFX-2147527	8.49261AFFX-2208108	2.65458AFFX-2343975	4.51827AFFX-2389926	1.20267AFFX-2436931	1.37248AFFX-2472766	2.64062AFFX-2557092	1.75692AFFX-2629782	1.09004!sample_table_end
