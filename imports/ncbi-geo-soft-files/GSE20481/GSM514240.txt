Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514240/suppl/GSM514240.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	0.903481AFFX-121907	2.14347AFFX-1258602	5.6255AFFX-1304348	4.17676AFFX-1329481	3.61374AFFX-1375402	5.49282AFFX-157566	4.05593AFFX-1693093	0.817242AFFX-1852733	9.85386AFFX-1944727	4.15729AFFX-1987483	3.36212AFFX-2126602	3.5455AFFX-2147527	8.18143AFFX-2208108	7.64196AFFX-2343975	3.80248AFFX-2389926	4.14718AFFX-2436931	2.38861AFFX-2472766	3.3074AFFX-2557092	7.75162AFFX-2629782	4.51192!sample_table_end
