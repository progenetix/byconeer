Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM513nnn/GSM513994/suppl/GSM513994.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.69915AFFX-121907	2.02434AFFX-1258602	4.1798AFFX-1304348	0.979982AFFX-1329481	0.599671AFFX-1375402	10.438AFFX-157566	2.74154AFFX-1693093	1.01957AFFX-1852733	1.5429AFFX-1944727	0.614172AFFX-1987483	1.14035AFFX-2126602	4.8677AFFX-2147527	2.51507AFFX-2208108	1.59022AFFX-2343975	5.52414AFFX-2389926	3.02713AFFX-2436931	2.55007AFFX-2472766	1.9347AFFX-2557092	0.737177AFFX-2629782	2.14222!sample_table_end
