Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514422/suppl/GSM514422.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	7.31264AFFX-121907	5.15073AFFX-1258602	6.70066AFFX-1304348	5.57147AFFX-1329481	3.96057AFFX-1375402	4.15541AFFX-157566	3.7601AFFX-1693093	1.50822AFFX-1852733	6.53166AFFX-1944727	2.56945AFFX-1987483	3.02631AFFX-2126602	2.42428AFFX-2147527	3.18462AFFX-2208108	5.56133AFFX-2343975	4.19737AFFX-2389926	1.52382AFFX-2436931	1.23982AFFX-2472766	2.57829AFFX-2557092	1.94692AFFX-2629782	2.51076!sample_table_end
