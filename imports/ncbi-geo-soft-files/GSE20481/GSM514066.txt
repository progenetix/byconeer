Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514066/suppl/GSM514066.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.74393AFFX-121907	1.12423AFFX-1258602	11.0561AFFX-1304348	1.13374AFFX-1329481	3.20575AFFX-1375402	9.06082AFFX-157566	12.0078AFFX-1693093	1.62312AFFX-1852733	2.74623AFFX-1944727	2.38812AFFX-1987483	2.40834AFFX-2126602	4.61539AFFX-2147527	5.59842AFFX-2208108	2.61242AFFX-2343975	3.38509AFFX-2389926	2.37209AFFX-2436931	2.74173AFFX-2472766	4.7657AFFX-2557092	1.67113AFFX-2629782	2.29003!sample_table_end
