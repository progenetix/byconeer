Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514037/suppl/GSM514037.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 57299#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	1.00233AFFX-121907	1.47429AFFX-1258602	15.107AFFX-1304348	1.85581AFFX-1329481	3.18684AFFX-1375402	8.20001AFFX-157566	6.14197AFFX-1693093	2.79249AFFX-1852733	5.21215AFFX-1944727	2.67379AFFX-1987483	2.18841AFFX-2126602	2.7311AFFX-2147527	7.1615AFFX-2208108	2.31283AFFX-2343975	3.63661AFFX-2389926	1.59207AFFX-2436931	1.32498AFFX-2472766	3.06696AFFX-2557092	2.16814AFFX-2629782	1.67974!sample_table_end
