Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514415/suppl/GSM514415.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	2.18484AFFX-121907	6.25688AFFX-1258602	4.2952AFFX-1304348	3.81197AFFX-1329481	4.23217AFFX-1375402	9.74773AFFX-157566	2.94254AFFX-1693093	2.02182AFFX-1852733	5.11987AFFX-1944727	4.97022AFFX-1987483	5.39898AFFX-2126602	6.34747AFFX-2147527	8.03458AFFX-2208108	5.41989AFFX-2343975	4.97283AFFX-2389926	1.94174AFFX-2436931	2.14873AFFX-2472766	2.05341AFFX-2557092	2.26556AFFX-2629782	4.76359!sample_table_end
