Affymetrix 100K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by Partek software (Build 6.08.0623) using the PM/MM difference model. Ninety normal samples were previously downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k) and averaged to establish the reference for calculating the copy numbers.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Xin,,Lu!Sample_contact_email = xin.x.lu@abbott.com!Sample_contact_phone = 847-937-7942!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Abbott Laboratories!Sample_contact_address = 100 Abbott Park Rd!Sample_contact_city = Abbott Park!Sample_contact_state = IL!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 60064!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM514nnn/GSM514292/suppl/GSM514292.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20481!Sample_data_row_count = 59015#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number of each SNPs loci!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-1204904	2.76835AFFX-121907	3.22003AFFX-1258602	6.88825AFFX-1304348	3.82166AFFX-1329481	3.94036AFFX-1375402	2.91581AFFX-157566	5.83299AFFX-1693093	2.6119AFFX-1852733	10.6547AFFX-1944727	3.18381AFFX-1987483	4.05462AFFX-2126602	10.0451AFFX-2147527	4.32453AFFX-2208108	6.23334AFFX-2343975	3.91532AFFX-2389926	1.40955AFFX-2436931	1.99476AFFX-2472766	2.94003AFFX-2557092	4.13031AFFX-2629782	1.28219!sample_table_end
