(PMID: 21235737). Hybridization quality was estimated by the genotype call rate using the Birdseed genotype calling algorithm in Genotyping Console (version 4.0, Affymetrix). We performed copy number analysis in Nexus software version 5 using CNCHP log-ratio files generated by genotyping console using 27 controls as a baseline, which is a subset of the reference set of 29 samples which was used in Pansuriya et al (PMID: 21235737, GEO Series accession number GSE22984), because we rejected 2 samples based on results from the quality control analysis in Genotyping Console. We used the following samples for the reference file (GEO accession numbers): GSM566679, GSM566716, GSM566745, GSM566752, GSM566762, GSM566780, GSM566785, GSM566787, GSM566788, GSM566789, GSM566790, GSM566791, GSM566814, GSM566815, GSM567029, GSM567042, GSM567046, GSM567050, GSM567053, GSM567055, GSM567062, GSM567083, GSM567110, GSM567114, GSM567339, GSM567342, GSM567343. Hidden Markov model (HMM) based SNP-FASST segmentation was used to identify aberrant genomic regions. We used an aberration frequency cut-off of 35%.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Marieke,Lydia,Kuijjer!Sample_contact_laboratory = Kuijjer!Sample_contact_institute = Centre for Molecular Medicine Norway!Sample_contact_address = GaustadallÃ©en 21!Sample_contact_city = Oslo!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 0349!Sample_contact_country = Norway!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM821nnn/GSM821002/suppl/GSM821002.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33153!Sample_series_id = GSE33383!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number#Log2Ratio = #SmoothSignal = #LOH = #Allele Difference = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Log2Ratio	SmoothSignal	LOH	Allele DifferenceCN_473963	2	0.411684	1.9318	null	nullCN_473964	2	0.0701587	1.93169	null	nullCN_473965	2	0.0779251	1.93167	null	nullCN_473981	2	-0.0875353	1.93008	null	nullCN_473982	2	0.175905	1.93005	null	nullCN_497981	2	-0.332499	1.91589	null	nullCN_502615	2	-0.265529	1.8974	null	nullCN_502613	2	-0.474822	1.89732	null	nullCN_502614	2	-0.0290766	1.89687	null	nullCN_502616	2	0.162478	1.89684	null	nullCN_502843	2	-0.0915662	1.88022	null	nullCN_466171	2	0.273925	1.4515	null	nullCN_468414	2	-1.03181	1.45157	null	nullCN_468412	2	-0.349505	1.45158	null	nullCN_468413	2	-0.171784	1.45158	null	nullCN_470565	2	-0.297188	1.45166	null	nullCN_468424	2	-0.118575	1.45274	null	nullCN_468425	2	-0.101519	1.45275	null	nullCN_460512	2	0.140568	2.83052	null	nullCN_460513	2	0.416436	2.83052	null	null!sample_table_end
