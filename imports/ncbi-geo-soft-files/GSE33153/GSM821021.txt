(PMID: 21235737). Hybridization quality was estimated by the genotype call rate using the Birdseed genotype calling algorithm in Genotyping Console (version 4.0, Affymetrix). We performed copy number analysis in Nexus software version 5 using CNCHP log-ratio files generated by genotyping console using 27 controls as a baseline, which is a subset of the reference set of 29 samples which was used in Pansuriya et al (PMID: 21235737, GEO Series accession number GSE22984), because we rejected 2 samples based on results from the quality control analysis in Genotyping Console. We used the following samples for the reference file (GEO accession numbers): GSM566679, GSM566716, GSM566745, GSM566752, GSM566762, GSM566780, GSM566785, GSM566787, GSM566788, GSM566789, GSM566790, GSM566791, GSM566814, GSM566815, GSM567029, GSM567042, GSM567046, GSM567050, GSM567053, GSM567055, GSM567062, GSM567083, GSM567110, GSM567114, GSM567339, GSM567342, GSM567343. Hidden Markov model (HMM) based SNP-FASST segmentation was used to identify aberrant genomic regions. We used an aberration frequency cut-off of 35%.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Marieke,Lydia,Kuijjer!Sample_contact_laboratory = Kuijjer!Sample_contact_institute = Centre for Molecular Medicine Norway!Sample_contact_address = GaustadallÃ©en 21!Sample_contact_city = Oslo!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 0349!Sample_contact_country = Norway!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM821nnn/GSM821021/suppl/GSM821021.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33153!Sample_series_id = GSE33383!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number#Log2Ratio = #SmoothSignal = #LOH = #Allele Difference = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Log2Ratio	SmoothSignal	LOH	Allele DifferenceCN_473963	4	1.36882	4.35854	null	nullCN_473964	4	0.503529	4.35836	null	nullCN_473965	4	0.728162	4.35832	null	nullCN_473981	4	0.630771	4.3555	null	nullCN_473982	4	0.490499	4.35546	null	nullCN_497981	4	0.0151005	4.32981	null	nullCN_502615	4	0.669349	4.29442	null	nullCN_502613	4	0.123794	4.29425	null	nullCN_502614	4	0.89465	4.29336	null	nullCN_502616	4	1.30966	4.29331	null	nullCN_502843	4	0.0415585	4.25915	null	nullCN_466171	1	-0.764317	1.20946	null	nullCN_468414	1	-0.271707	1.20922	null	nullCN_468412	1	0.464968	1.20916	null	nullCN_468413	1	0.227667	1.20915	null	nullCN_470565	1	-0.498429	1.20886	null	nullCN_468424	1	-0.761838	1.20489	null	nullCN_468425	1	-1.23115	1.20485	null	nullCN_460512	1	0.287001	2.74838	null	nullCN_460513	1	0.222774	2.74838	null	null!sample_table_end
