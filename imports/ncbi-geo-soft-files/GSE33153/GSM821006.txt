(PMID: 21235737). Hybridization quality was estimated by the genotype call rate using the Birdseed genotype calling algorithm in Genotyping Console (version 4.0, Affymetrix). We performed copy number analysis in Nexus software version 5 using CNCHP log-ratio files generated by genotyping console using 27 controls as a baseline, which is a subset of the reference set of 29 samples which was used in Pansuriya et al (PMID: 21235737, GEO Series accession number GSE22984), because we rejected 2 samples based on results from the quality control analysis in Genotyping Console. We used the following samples for the reference file (GEO accession numbers): GSM566679, GSM566716, GSM566745, GSM566752, GSM566762, GSM566780, GSM566785, GSM566787, GSM566788, GSM566789, GSM566790, GSM566791, GSM566814, GSM566815, GSM567029, GSM567042, GSM567046, GSM567050, GSM567053, GSM567055, GSM567062, GSM567083, GSM567110, GSM567114, GSM567339, GSM567342, GSM567343. Hidden Markov model (HMM) based SNP-FASST segmentation was used to identify aberrant genomic regions. We used an aberration frequency cut-off of 35%.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Marieke,Lydia,Kuijjer!Sample_contact_laboratory = Kuijjer!Sample_contact_institute = Centre for Molecular Medicine Norway!Sample_contact_address = GaustadallÃ©en 21!Sample_contact_city = Oslo!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 0349!Sample_contact_country = Norway!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM821nnn/GSM821006/suppl/GSM821006.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33153!Sample_series_id = GSE33383!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number#Log2Ratio = #SmoothSignal = #LOH = #Allele Difference = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Log2Ratio	SmoothSignal	LOH	Allele DifferenceCN_473963	2	-0.330906	1.50949	null	nullCN_473964	2	-0.178272	1.50955	null	nullCN_473965	2	-0.231479	1.50956	null	nullCN_473981	2	-0.525508	1.5104	null	nullCN_473982	2	-0.201949	1.51041	null	nullCN_497981	2	-0.401438	1.51798	null	nullCN_502615	2	0.209274	1.52824	null	nullCN_502613	2	0.143606	1.52829	null	nullCN_502614	2	-0.202183	1.52855	null	nullCN_502616	2	-0.507284	1.52856	null	nullCN_502843	2	-0.192575	1.53818	null	nullCN_466171	2	-0.123591	1.84224	null	nullCN_468414	2	-0.295162	1.84234	null	nullCN_468412	2	-0.282547	1.84236	null	nullCN_468413	2	-0.377603	1.84237	null	nullCN_470565	2	0.485666	1.84248	null	nullCN_468424	2	0.0443473	1.8441	null	nullCN_468425	2	0.0903515	1.84412	null	nullCN_460512	2	-0.0613176	2.46004	null	nullCN_460513	2	0.393346	2.46004	null	null!sample_table_end
