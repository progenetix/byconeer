(PMID: 21235737). Hybridization quality was estimated by the genotype call rate using the Birdseed genotype calling algorithm in Genotyping Console (version 4.0, Affymetrix). We performed copy number analysis in Nexus software version 5 using CNCHP log-ratio files generated by genotyping console using 27 controls as a baseline, which is a subset of the reference set of 29 samples which was used in Pansuriya et al (PMID: 21235737, GEO Series accession number GSE22984), because we rejected 2 samples based on results from the quality control analysis in Genotyping Console. We used the following samples for the reference file (GEO accession numbers): GSM566679, GSM566716, GSM566745, GSM566752, GSM566762, GSM566780, GSM566785, GSM566787, GSM566788, GSM566789, GSM566790, GSM566791, GSM566814, GSM566815, GSM567029, GSM567042, GSM567046, GSM567050, GSM567053, GSM567055, GSM567062, GSM567083, GSM567110, GSM567114, GSM567339, GSM567342, GSM567343. Hidden Markov model (HMM) based SNP-FASST segmentation was used to identify aberrant genomic regions. We used an aberration frequency cut-off of 35%.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Marieke,Lydia,Kuijjer!Sample_contact_laboratory = Kuijjer!Sample_contact_institute = Centre for Molecular Medicine Norway!Sample_contact_address = GaustadallÃ©en 21!Sample_contact_city = Oslo!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 0349!Sample_contact_country = Norway!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM821nnn/GSM821019/suppl/GSM821019.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33153!Sample_series_id = GSE33383!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number#Log2Ratio = #SmoothSignal = #LOH = #Allele Difference = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Log2Ratio	SmoothSignal	LOH	Allele DifferenceCN_473963	2	0.37187	2.02608	null	nullCN_473964	2	-0.0527558	2.02599	null	nullCN_473965	2	0.133086	2.02598	null	nullCN_473981	2	-0.562922	2.02469	null	nullCN_473982	2	0.550953	2.02467	null	nullCN_497981	2	0.531326	2.01338	null	nullCN_502615	2	-0.0121883	1.99915	null	nullCN_502613	2	-0.0718102	1.99909	null	nullCN_502614	2	-0.0705424	1.99875	null	nullCN_502616	2	-1.22601	1.99873	null	nullCN_502843	2	0.487543	1.98665	null	nullCN_466171	2	-0.0273167	1.79692	null	nullCN_468414	2	-0.415742	1.79673	null	nullCN_468412	2	0.101701	1.79668	null	nullCN_468413	2	0.519645	1.79667	null	nullCN_470565	2	0.0328175	1.79644	null	nullCN_468424	2	-0.479635	1.79323	null	nullCN_468425	2	-0.338723	1.79319	null	nullCN_460512	2	-0.0498624	1.95373	null	nullCN_460513	2	0.0123235	1.95373	null	null!sample_table_end
