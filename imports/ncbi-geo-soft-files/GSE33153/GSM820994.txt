(PMID: 21235737). Hybridization quality was estimated by the genotype call rate using the Birdseed genotype calling algorithm in Genotyping Console (version 4.0, Affymetrix). We performed copy number analysis in Nexus software version 5 using CNCHP log-ratio files generated by genotyping console using 27 controls as a baseline, which is a subset of the reference set of 29 samples which was used in Pansuriya et al (PMID: 21235737, GEO Series accession number GSE22984), because we rejected 2 samples based on results from the quality control analysis in Genotyping Console. We used the following samples for the reference file (GEO accession numbers): GSM566679, GSM566716, GSM566745, GSM566752, GSM566762, GSM566780, GSM566785, GSM566787, GSM566788, GSM566789, GSM566790, GSM566791, GSM566814, GSM566815, GSM567029, GSM567042, GSM567046, GSM567050, GSM567053, GSM567055, GSM567062, GSM567083, GSM567110, GSM567114, GSM567339, GSM567342, GSM567343. Hidden Markov model (HMM) based SNP-FASST segmentation was used to identify aberrant genomic regions. We used an aberration frequency cut-off of 35%.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Marieke,Lydia,Kuijjer!Sample_contact_laboratory = Kuijjer!Sample_contact_institute = Centre for Molecular Medicine Norway!Sample_contact_address = GaustadallÃ©en 21!Sample_contact_city = Oslo!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 0349!Sample_contact_country = Norway!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM820nnn/GSM820994/suppl/GSM820994.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33153!Sample_series_id = GSE33383!Sample_data_row_count = 1813441#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number#Log2Ratio = #SmoothSignal = #LOH = #Allele Difference = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Log2Ratio	SmoothSignal	LOH	Allele DifferenceCN_473963	1	-0.8998	0.900946	null	nullCN_473964	1	-0.827144	0.901105	null	nullCN_473965	1	-1.07066	0.901138	null	nullCN_473981	1	-1.7159	0.903534	null	nullCN_473982	1	-0.923835	0.903571	null	nullCN_497981	1	0.0622926	0.925465	null	nullCN_502615	1	-0.297866	0.955808	null	nullCN_502613	1	0.625724	0.955954	null	nullCN_502614	1	-0.803217	0.95672	null	nullCN_502616	1	-0.907863	0.95676	null	nullCN_502843	2	0.0287574	0.98602	null	nullCN_466171	2	-0.552774	1.94761	null	nullCN_468414	2	0.15046	1.94757	null	nullCN_468412	2	0.157588	1.94757	null	nullCN_468413	2	-0.119441	1.94756	null	nullCN_470565	2	0.441572	1.94752	null	nullCN_468424	2	-0.00301254	1.94686	null	nullCN_468425	2	-0.225117	1.94685	null	nullCN_460512	2	0.0212693	2.40323	null	nullCN_460513	2	0.273288	2.40323	null	null!sample_table_end
