Extraction of genomic DNA from these FFPE cores was performed using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturerâs instructions with the following exceptions (i)  tissue samples were pre-treated in 1M sodium thiocyanate overnight at 37oC to remove cross-links and (ii) an extended tissue digestion step was performed over three nights with supplementary Proteinase K added every 24 hours. Eluted DNA was further purified by ethanol precipitation and then assessed for purity using the Nanodrop-2000 and double stranded DNA was quantified using the QubitÂ® fluorometer (Invitrogen) as per manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 250ng dsDNA was labelled with Cy3 using the ULS labelling system for formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples (Agilent Technologies).!Sample_source_name_ch2 = normal female genomic DNA (Promega)!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = disease: normal!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = dna source: reference DNA (Promega)!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Tumour cores were punched from the FFPE blocks to enrich for tumour epithelial cells.
