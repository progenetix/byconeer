PMID 16230395), and metastatic cell lines were cultured as previously described (Segura et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 2009. PMID 19188590  ).!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Melanoma and melanocyte DNA was extracted using the Qiagen QIAmp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen Valencia, CA). DNA quantity was assessed by UV spectrophotometry and quality was assayed by agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR purified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP6.0 Arrays!Sample_data_processing = CEL files were generated using the GeneChip Command Console software (Affymetrix), and the Birdseed v2 algorithm (Korn et al. Nat Genet, 2008. PMID 18776909) was used to make the genotype calls and summarize the probe-set intensity (SPI) values for ensuing copy number analysis. A single normal reference genome profile assayed in the same batch was created using values from the 2 normal melanocytes cultured from infant foreskin (HEM-N and HEM-LP).!Sample_data_processing = 1. 22 CHP files for melanoma and melanocyte cell lines 2.
