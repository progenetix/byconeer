PMID 16230395), and metastatic cell lines were cultured as previously described (Segura et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 2009. PMID 19188590  ).!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Melanoma and melanocyte DNA was extracted using the Qiagen QIAmp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen Valencia, CA). DNA quantity was assessed by UV spectrophotometry and quality was assayed by agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR purified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP6.0 Arrays!Sample_data_processing = CEL files were generated using the GeneChip Command Console software (Affymetrix), and the Birdseed v2 algorithm (Korn et al. Nat Genet, 2008. PMID 18776909) was used to make the genotype calls and summarize the probe-set intensity (SPI) values for ensuing copy number analysis. A single normal reference genome profile assayed in the same batch was created using values from the 2 normal melanocytes cultured from infant foreskin (HEM-N and HEM-LP).!Sample_data_processing = Primary data description: 1. 22 CHP files for melanoma and melanocyte cell lines 2. Data table that includes the Genotype Call (AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall) and the intensity signal for signal A and signal B in 22 cell lines.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Iman,,Osman!Sample_contact_email = iman.osman@nyumc.org!Sample_contact_phone = 212-263-9089!Sample_contact_fax = 212-263-9090!Sample_contact_department = Urology!Sample_contact_institute = New York University School of Medicine!Sample_contact_address = 522 First Avenue, SML405!Sample_contact_city = New York!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 10016!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM555nnn/GSM555168/suppl/GSM555168_002_SNP6_mel_082808.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM555nnn/GSM555168/suppl/GSM555168_002_SNP6_mel_082808.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE22305!Sample_series_id = GSE22306!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype Call#002_SNP6_mel_082808.birdseed.chp Signal A = #002_SNP6_mel_082808.birdseed.chp Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	002_SNP6_mel_082808.birdseed.chp Signal A	002_SNP6_mel_082808.birdseed.chp Signal BSNP_A-2131660	BB	413.978	2011.025SNP_A-1967418	BB	237.188	722.232SNP_A-1969580	BB	1407.042	5045.537SNP_A-4263484	AA	1886.075	350.453SNP_A-1978185	AA	1254.677	218.423SNP_A-4264431	AA	1713.488	358.784SNP_A-1980898	BB	308.324	837.084SNP_A-1983139	AA	978.808	756.389SNP_A-4265735	AA	858.651	279.848SNP_A-1995832	BB	343.614	1763.836SNP_A-1995893	BB	374.968	2290.856SNP_A-1997689	BB	455.954	2445.529SNP_A-1997709	AA	1041.551	259.753SNP_A-1997896	AA	1093.352	316.699SNP_A-1997922	AB	362.132	515.020SNP_A-2000230	AA	2015.398	617.161SNP_A-2000332	AA	2722.623	408.609SNP_A-2000337	AA	1747.919	284.438SNP_A-2000342	AA	3097.722	723.732SNP_A-4268173	NoCall	166.549	1001.524!sample_table_end
