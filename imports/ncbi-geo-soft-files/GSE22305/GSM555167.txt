PMID 16230395), and metastatic cell lines were cultured as previously described (Segura et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 2009. PMID 19188590  ).!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Melanoma and melanocyte DNA was extracted using the Qiagen QIAmp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen Valencia, CA). DNA quantity was assessed by UV spectrophotometry and quality was assayed by agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR purified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP6.0 Arrays!Sample_data_processing = CEL files were generated using the GeneChip Command Console software (Affymetrix), and the Birdseed v2 algorithm (Korn et al. Nat Genet, 2008. PMID 18776909) was used to make the genotype calls and summarize the probe-set intensity (SPI) values for ensuing copy number analysis. A single normal reference genome profile assayed in the same batch was created using values from the 2 normal melanocytes cultured from infant foreskin (HEM-N and HEM-LP).!Sample_data_processing = Primary data description: 1. 22 CHP files for melanoma and melanocyte cell lines 2. Data table that includes the Genotype Call (AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall) and the intensity signal for signal A and signal B in 22 cell lines.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Iman,,Osman!Sample_contact_email = iman.osman@nyumc.org!Sample_contact_phone = 212-263-9089!Sample_contact_fax = 212-263-9090!Sample_contact_department = Urology!Sample_contact_institute = New York University School of Medicine!Sample_contact_address = 522 First Avenue, SML405!Sample_contact_city = New York!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 10016!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM555nnn/GSM555167/suppl/GSM555167_001_SNP6_mel_082808.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM555nnn/GSM555167/suppl/GSM555167_001_SNP6_mel_082808.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE22305!Sample_series_id = GSE22306!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype Call#001_SNP6_mel_082808.birdseed.chp Signal A = #001_SNP6_mel_082808.birdseed.chp Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	001_SNP6_mel_082808.birdseed.chp Signal A	001_SNP6_mel_082808.birdseed.chp Signal BSNP_A-2131660	BB	414.961	1890.858SNP_A-1967418	BB	289.725	575.546SNP_A-1969580	BB	959.137	4083.305SNP_A-4263484	BB	322.657	1095.110SNP_A-1978185	AA	1068.027	285.790SNP_A-4264431	AB	895.210	694.220SNP_A-1980898	BB	323.461	716.921SNP_A-1983139	AA	1282.105	399.172SNP_A-4265735	AB	705.866	601.228SNP_A-1995832	BB	440.309	1927.317SNP_A-1995893	BB	488.067	2543.615SNP_A-1997689	BB	369.764	2307.935SNP_A-1997709	AA	1028.011	307.786SNP_A-1997896	AB	778.657	1088.323SNP_A-1997922	AA	646.415	238.616SNP_A-2000230	AA	1967.382	686.986SNP_A-2000332	AA	3463.614	757.223SNP_A-2000337	AA	1043.329	203.119SNP_A-2000342	AA	2593.396	612.646SNP_A-4268173	AA	1696.546	305.972!sample_table_end
