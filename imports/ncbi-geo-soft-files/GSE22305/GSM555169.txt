PMID 16230395), and metastatic cell lines were cultured as previously described (Segura et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 2009. PMID 19188590  ).!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Melanoma and melanocyte DNA was extracted using the Qiagen QIAmp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen Valencia, CA). DNA quantity was assessed by UV spectrophotometry and quality was assayed by agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR purified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP6.0 Arrays!Sample_data_processing = CEL files were generated using the GeneChip Command Console software (Affymetrix), and the Birdseed v2 algorithm (Korn et al. Nat Genet, 2008. PMID 18776909) was used to make the genotype calls and summarize the probe-set intensity (SPI) values for ensuing copy number analysis. A single normal reference genome profile assayed in the same batch was created using values from the 2 normal melanocytes cultured from infant foreskin (HEM-N and HEM-LP).!Sample_data_processing = Primary data description: 1. 22 CHP files for melanoma and melanocyte cell lines 2. Data table that includes the Genotype Call (AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall) and the intensity signal for signal A and signal B in 22 cell lines.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Iman,,Osman!Sample_contact_email = iman.osman@nyumc.org!Sample_contact_phone = 212-263-9089!Sample_contact_fax = 212-263-9090!Sample_contact_department = Urology!Sample_contact_institute = New York University School of Medicine!Sample_contact_address = 522 First Avenue, SML405!Sample_contact_city = New York!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 10016!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM555nnn/GSM555169/suppl/GSM555169_003_SNP6_mel_082908.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM555nnn/GSM555169/suppl/GSM555169_003_SNP6_mel_082908.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE22305!Sample_series_id = GSE22306!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype Call#003_SNP6_mel_082908.birdseed.chp Signal A = #003_SNP6_mel_082908.birdseed.chp Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	003_SNP6_mel_082908.birdseed.chp Signal A	003_SNP6_mel_082908.birdseed.chp Signal BSNP_A-2131660	BB	384.401	1775.637SNP_A-1967418	BB	329.754	656.692SNP_A-1969580	BB	1475.568	3744.934SNP_A-4263484	AA	2012.690	363.289SNP_A-1978185	AA	1259.972	352.852SNP_A-4264431	AB	807.986	589.852SNP_A-1980898	BB	257.919	559.402SNP_A-1983139	AA	1354.200	415.930SNP_A-4265735	AA	805.558	324.457SNP_A-1995832	BB	395.265	1928.448SNP_A-1995893	BB	466.929	2308.586SNP_A-1997689	BB	376.244	2246.663SNP_A-1997709	AA	990.167	278.269SNP_A-1997896	AB	786.424	1043.817SNP_A-1997922	AB	493.103	387.716SNP_A-2000230	AA	1612.418	599.796SNP_A-2000332	AB	2206.833	2273.537SNP_A-2000337	AA	1204.278	209.788SNP_A-2000342	AA	2638.992	682.594SNP_A-4268173	AA	1630.268	322.546!sample_table_end
