Test and reference samples were mixed and hybridization buffer (Agilent oligo aCGH hybridization kit) were added, and samples were applied to microarrays enclosed in Agilent SureHyb-enabled hybridization chambers. After 40 hours of hybridization at 65Â°C, slides were washed following Wash Procedure B according to Agilent manufacturer recommendations.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned on G2505C scanner. Images were quantified using Agilent Feature Extraction Software (version 10.7.3.1).!Sample_description = Multiple myeloma derived from newly diagnosed patients with translocation in BCL1/JH t(11;14)(q13;q32)!Sample_data_processing = Agilent Feature Extraction Software (v 10.7.3.1) was used for background subtraction and normalization. Microarray data were then analyzed with ADM2 algorithm, bin size 10 and threshold 6.0 by using DNA Analytics Software (v4.0).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Ivyna,PN,Bong!Sample_contact_email = ivyna@moh.gov.my!Sample_contact_phone = +603 26162715!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genetics!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research Centre!Sample_contact_institute = Institute for Medical Research!Sample_contact_address = Jalan Pahang!Sample_contact_city = Kuala Lumpur!Sample_contact_state = Kuala Lumpur!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 50588!Sample_contact_country = Malaysia!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM835nnn/GSM835115/suppl/GSM835115_US45103080_251469379075_S01.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33757!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	4.575482416e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	-2.003055716e-0035	1.822217950e-0026	-1.058145423e-0017	-5.460403499e-0028	1.888483878e-0029	8.960331911e-00210	1.565590765e-00111	4.516601409e-00212	-1.557141578e-00213	-4.500661588e-00214	1.774997395e-00115	1.488697020e-00116	-5.333016545e-00217	6.860216959e-00218	-4.807437164e-00219	2.132326621e-00220	1.840812105e-001!sample_table_end
