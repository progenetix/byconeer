The CEL files and corresponding SNP genotype cell files were imported into dChip, normalized and modeled. Probe intensity data for each array were normalized using the invariant set method, and model-based expression was performed using the perfect-match/mismatch (PM/MM) model to summarize signal intensities for each probe set. (DNA copy number was inferred by comparing the signal intensity of each SNP probe set for each tumor sample against the diploid reference set, with subsequent median smoothing over a window size of 10.)!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = David,J.
