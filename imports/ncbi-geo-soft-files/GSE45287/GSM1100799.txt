Image data acquisition was performed in feature extraction software v9.5.1 (Agilent Technologies) using the Agilent CGH_107_Sep09 protocol with default settings!Sample_description = ch1 raw data file: 11668_S01_CGH_107_Sep09_1_4.txt!Sample_description = ch2 raw data file: 11668_S01_CGH_107_Sep09_1_4.txt!Sample_description = Pooled DNA from the blood of 100 healthy individuals was used as reference in the aCGH experiments; across array CGH comparisons were made as described by Buffart et al, Genes, Chromosomes & Cancer 2008, 47(11): 994-1004!Sample_data_processing = Median Signal intensity minus median Background intensity; excluding negative values. To overcome potential wave bias due to differences in GC-content of the different chromosomal regions, a smoothing algorithm was applied on our dataset as described by van de Wiel et al, Bioinformatics 2009; 25(9):1099-1104. We use the sex difference as an internal quality control measure to check for experiment errors.!Sample_data_processing = Dual channel hybs were analysed as single channel and compared as listed above.
