Initially, the DNA was denatured in the presence of the random primer at 95ÂºC for 3 minutes in a thermomixer and then quickly cooled in ice. The labeling occurred with the addition of fluorescent dye dUTP-cyanine 3 (Reference DNA) and dUTP-cyanine 5 (Test DNA). Incubation took place for 2 hours at 37ÂºC in a water bath. The unincorporated nucleotides were removed using Microcon YM-30 filter units (Millipore) and the purified labeled DNA was eluted with 1 x TE Buffer pH 8.0.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Human female genomic DNA!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = sample type: reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Promega (P/N G152A)!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = 3 Î¼g of digested reference genomic DNA and test genomic DNA was differentially labeled using the Genomic DNA Enzymatic Labeling Kit (Agilent Technologies).

Following centrifugation, the sample mixture was resuspended in 260ul 2X HI-RPM hybridization buffer, heated to 95Â°C for 5 minutes and incubated for 30 minutes at 37Â°C to block repetitive elements on the DNA samples. Then, samples were applied to microarrays enclosed in Agilent SureHyb-enabled hybridization chambers. Hybridization was performed for 40 hours at 65Â°C using an Agilent hybridization station. After hybridization, slides were washed sequentially.!Sample_scan_protocol = Slides were scanned on an Agilent G2505B scanner.!Sample_description = PALL-3!Sample_data_processing = Images were quantified using Agilent Feature Extraction Software v10.7.3.1. Deep analysis, comparison and visualization of the raw genomic data were performed using Agilentâs DNA Analytics v4.0.76 software. The ADM2 algorithm with a threshold of 6.0 was used.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Zubaidah,,Zakaria!Sample_contact_email = zubaidah@imr.gov.my!Sample_contact_phone = 0326162708!Sample_contact_fax = 0326162707!Sample_contact_laboratory = array CGH Lab!Sample_contact_department = Haematology Unit!Sample_contact_institute = Institute for Medical Research!Sample_contact_address = Jalan Pahang!Sample_contact_city = Kuala Lumpur!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 50588!Sample_contact_country = Malaysia!Sample_contact_web_link = www.imr.gov.my!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM814nnn/GSM814475/suppl/GSM814475.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE32897!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (Cy5/Cy3) representing test/reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	0.0149170142	0.5117143153	0.5985150574	-0.1725787455	-0.0549255986	-0.1588854457	-0.0041700898	-0.1927807739	-0.13577209610	0.16493689811	-0.20674142112	-0.24153322213	-0.03203265614	-0.11815570315	-0.17141149216	0.00789210917	-0.07822685218	0.03376732919	0.0377870720	-0.242623405!sample_table_end
