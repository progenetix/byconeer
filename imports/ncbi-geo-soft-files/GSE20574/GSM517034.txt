Human male genomic DNA (Promega P/N G1471) was used as reference.  Individual log2 ratios of background subtracted signal intensities were obtained from the Agilent Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and the resulting log2 ratio values for each probe were segmented using GLAD [3]. All probes within the genomic bounds of a given GLAD-derived segment were given the mean copy number value of probes within that segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM517nnn/GSM517034/suppl/GSM517034.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20574!Sample_series_id = GSE20585!Sample_data_row_count = 235834#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_14_P112718	1.84363889694214A_16_P15000916	1.84363889694214A_16_P15001074	1.84363889694214A_16_P00000012	1.84363889694214A_16_P00000014	1.84363889694214A_16_P00000017	1.84363889694214A_16_P00000021	1.84363889694214A_16_P00000023	1.84363889694214A_16_P00000027	1.84363889694214A_16_P00000033	1.84363889694214A_16_P35001586	1.84363889694214A_16_P15001533	1.84363889694214A_16_P00000060	1.84363889694214A_16_P15001594	1.84363889694214A_16_P00000082	1.84363889694214A_16_P00000090	1.84363889694214A_16_P00000099	1.84363889694214A_16_P15001666	1.84363889694214A_16_P00000112	1.84363889694214A_16_P00000114	1.84363889694214!sample_table_end
