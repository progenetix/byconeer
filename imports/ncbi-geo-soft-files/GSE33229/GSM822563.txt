Briefly, two aliqouts of 250 ng of high quality genomic DNA were subjected to Nsp I and Sty I digestion respectively.  Nsp I adaptor and Sty I adpator were then ligated to the corresponding digested DNA and diluted 1:4.  The resulting DNA were amplified by PCR using clonetech titanium PCR reagents and primer provided by Affymetrix.  The amplified DNA were combined and purified using Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads, fragmented, and labeled using Terminal DNA Transferase.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The labeled DNA was hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip Genome-Wide human SNP 6.0  arrays for 17hr at 50 C with constant rotation (60 rpm).  Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 was used to wash and stain the Chips, removing the non-hybridized target and incubating with a streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate to stain the biotinilated DNA.  The staining was further amplified using goat IgG as blocking reagent and biotinilated anti-streptavidin antibody (goat), followed by a second staining step with a streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate.!Sample_scan_protocol = Fluorescence was detected using the Affymetrix G3000 GeneArray Scanner and image analysis of each GeneChip was perfomed through the Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console version 3.0 (AGCC v3.0) software from Affymetrix, using the standard default settings.!Sample_description = PHen-HNC-24642-1a-SNP6_0_(GenomeWideSNP_6).CEL!Sample_data_processing = Analysis was performed in R with CRLMM package.!Sample_data_processing = The processed data file (linked as supplementary file on Series record) comprises CNV estimation by gene provided as the average of CNV calls across gene region.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Michael,F,Ochs!Sample_contact_department = Oncology Biostatistics!Sample_contact_institute = Johns Hopkins University!Sample_contact_address = 550 North Broadway, Ste 1103!Sample_contact_city = Baltimore!Sample_contact_state = MD!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 21205!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM822nnn/GSM822563/suppl/GSM822563.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33229!Sample_series_id = GSE33232!Sample_data_row_count = 0
