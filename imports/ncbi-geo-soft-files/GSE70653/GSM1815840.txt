The matched normal CEL file is used as a reference in this processing. For each heterozygous position found in the normal tissue, the minor allele frequency (BAF) and the log of the ratio of the total signal intensity in the tumor and matched non-tumor sample (Log R) were calculated for the tumor tissue. ASCAT determined the aberrant cell fraction and mean genomic ploidy that best fits these points.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sanjanaa,,Nagarajan!Sample_contact_email = sanjanaa@duke-nus.edu.sg!Sample_contact_laboratory = NCCS-VARI Translational Research Laboratory!Sample_contact_department = Department of Medical Sciences!Sample_contact_institute = National Cancer Centre Singapore!Sample_contact_address = 11 Hospital Drive!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169610!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1815nnn/GSM1815840/suppl/GSM1815840_T065.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE70653!Sample_series_id = GSE70654!Sample_data_row_count = 931633#ID_REF = #VALUE = LRR = normalized logR value#normalized_BAF = #nA = #nB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	normalized_BAF	nA	nBSNP_A-8575125	0.577866653	0.003161352	1	1SNP_A-8575115	0.281937753	1.015937328	1	1SNP_A-8575371	-0.21033199	1.025448561	1	1SNP_A-8709646	-0.17726968	-0.015410423	1	1SNP_A-8497791	0.071014145	0.006420784	1	1SNP_A-1909444	0.433298117	0.487344503	1	1SNP_A-8358063	-0.120802974	0.045802832	1	1SNP_A-8329892	-0.308989189	0.002110105	1	1SNP_A-8408912	-0.115377318	0.471444786	1	1SNP_A-8294056	-0.107993203	0.558844268	1	1SNP_A-1886933	-0.074763943	0.516260564	1	1SNP_A-2236359	-0.198094884	1.045093298	1	1SNP_A-8515688	0.345273388	0.470917732	1	1SNP_A-2205441	0.291113951	-0.061362818	1	1SNP_A-8524447	0.30825212	0.045043081	1	1SNP_A-8573955	0.487829343	1.089814901	1	1SNP_A-8530278	0.409285501	1.074035168	1	1SNP_A-8573668	0.299636675	1.063412666	1	1SNP_A-8573414	0.29222188	0.401596278	1	1SNP_A-8531044	0.859449761	1.001776218	1	1!sample_table_end
