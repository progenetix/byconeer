The matched normal CEL file is used as a reference in this processing. For each heterozygous position found in the normal tissue, the minor allele frequency (BAF) and the log of the ratio of the total signal intensity in the tumor and matched non-tumor sample (Log R) were calculated for the tumor tissue. ASCAT determined the aberrant cell fraction and mean genomic ploidy that best fits these points.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sanjanaa,,Nagarajan!Sample_contact_email = sanjanaa@duke-nus.edu.sg!Sample_contact_laboratory = NCCS-VARI Translational Research Laboratory!Sample_contact_department = Department of Medical Sciences!Sample_contact_institute = National Cancer Centre Singapore!Sample_contact_address = 11 Hospital Drive!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169610!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1863nnn/GSM1863052/suppl/GSM1863052_N066.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE70653!Sample_series_id = GSE70654!Sample_data_row_count = 931633#ID_REF = #VALUE = LRR = normalized logR value#normalized_BAF = #nA = #nB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	normalized_BAF	nA	nBSNP_A-8575125	3990.5269	0.0633	NA	NASNP_A-8575115	7217.46	0.9787	NA	NASNP_A-8575371	6908.7993	0.915	NA	NASNP_A-8709646	761.4615	0.235	NA	NASNP_A-8497791	3134.2849	0.1159	NA	NASNP_A-1909444	5506.3447	0.483	NA	NASNP_A-8358063	6325.0918	0.2844	NA	NASNP_A-8329892	3127.616	0.0817	NA	NASNP_A-8408912	4362.0752	0.4584	NA	NASNP_A-8294056	1977.5441	0.5318	NA	NASNP_A-1886933	2933.4658	0.505	NA	NASNP_A-2236359	5636.7109	0.7912	NA	NASNP_A-8515688	5229.0835	0.4097	NA	NASNP_A-2205441	6096.334	0.1957	NA	NASNP_A-8524447	4253.3472	0.1375	NA	NASNP_A-8573955	1574.0306	0.308	NA	NASNP_A-8530278	3177.5237	0.5066	NA	NASNP_A-8573668	1420.6572	0.5715	NA	NASNP_A-8573414	1903.1437	0.7105	NA	NASNP_A-8531044	1793.6912	0.2849	NA	NA!sample_table_end
