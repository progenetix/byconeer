The matched normal CEL file is used as a reference in this processing. For each heterozygous position found in the normal tissue, the minor allele frequency (BAF) and the log of the ratio of the total signal intensity in the tumor and matched non-tumor sample (Log R) were calculated for the tumor tissue. ASCAT determined the aberrant cell fraction and mean genomic ploidy that best fits these points.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sanjanaa,,Nagarajan!Sample_contact_email = sanjanaa@duke-nus.edu.sg!Sample_contact_laboratory = NCCS-VARI Translational Research Laboratory!Sample_contact_department = Department of Medical Sciences!Sample_contact_institute = National Cancer Centre Singapore!Sample_contact_address = 11 Hospital Drive!Sample_contact_city = Singapore!Sample_contact_state = Singapore!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 169610!Sample_contact_country = Singapore!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1815nnn/GSM1815839/suppl/GSM1815839_N065.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE70653!Sample_series_id = GSE70654!Sample_data_row_count = 931633#ID_REF = #VALUE = LRR = normalized logR value#normalized_BAF = #nA = #nB = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	normalized_BAF	nA	nBSNP_A-8575125	4879.2075	0.0422	NA	NASNP_A-8575115	9660.0977	0.9582	NA	NASNP_A-8575371	8722.9209	0.8903	NA	NASNP_A-8709646	871.1342	0.1523	NA	NASNP_A-8497791	3200.9058	0.0647	NA	NASNP_A-1909444	5853.29	0.4545	NA	NASNP_A-8358063	6129.0918	0.2589	NA	NASNP_A-8329892	3393.8396	0.0498	NA	NASNP_A-8408912	4788.3794	0.4437	NA	NASNP_A-8294056	1526.9622	0.6091	NA	NASNP_A-1886933	2861.1753	0.4355	NA	NASNP_A-2236359	5986.1421	0.8377	NA	NASNP_A-8515688	4353.1592	0.4416	NA	NASNP_A-2205441	6653.7729	0.1881	NA	NASNP_A-8524447	4934.6182	0.313	NA	NASNP_A-8573955	1712.2192	0.6789	NA	NASNP_A-8530278	3081.2805	0.8392	NA	NASNP_A-8573668	2121.9194	0.7961	NA	NASNP_A-8573414	2070.6011	0.4601	NA	NASNP_A-8531044	2319.4919	0.6779	NA	NA!sample_table_end
