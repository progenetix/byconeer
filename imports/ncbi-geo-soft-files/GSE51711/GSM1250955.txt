DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Fludarabine-refractory-CLL_6012!Sample_data_processing = CEL files, CHP files and TXT files (generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Console using the Birdseed v2 algorithm) were processed by dChip and model-based expression performed using the PM/MM model. Normalization was performed using the reference normalization algorithm developed at St Jude and described in Mullighan et al Nature 2007;446:758. The data matrix contains the normalized expression values produced by that algorithm (see Matrix sheet and attached .cnmz files)!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Monica,,Messina!Sample_contact_email = messina@bce.uniroma1.it!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology!Sample_contact_institute = Sapienza University!Sample_contact_address = Via Benevento 26!Sample_contact_city = Rome!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 00161!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1250nnn/GSM1250955/suppl/GSM1250955_CR_CLL_6012.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1250nnn/GSM1250955/suppl/GSM1250955_CR_CLL_6012.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1250nnn/GSM1250955/suppl/GSM1250955_CR_CLL_6012.birdseed-v2.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE51711!Sample_data_row_count = 1875773
