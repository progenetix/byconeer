DNA is end-labeled with biotin using TdT.!Sample_hyb_protocol = 90 ug of fragmented labeled DNA is hybridised to the array for 16 hours at 49C accoring to Affymetrix protocols.!Sample_scan_protocol = Genechips were scanned on an Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G/4 color early acces scanner and processed using GCOS 1.4.0.!Sample_data_processing = SNP genotype calls were generated using Affymetrix Powertools  v1.8.0 (apt-probeset-genotype).  Calls were generated using the default parameters and the brlmm calling algorithm.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Brian,A,Walker!Sample_contact_email = brian.walker@icr.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Haematology Team!Sample_contact_department = Haemato-Oncology Research Unit!Sample_contact_institute = The Institute of Cancer Research!Sample_contact_address = 15 Cotswold Road!Sample_contact_city = Sutton!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SM2 5NG!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM533nnn/GSM533441/suppl/GSM533441.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM533nnn/GSM533441/suppl/GSM533441.CHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21349!Sample_data_row_count = 262338#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotypes: AA, AB, BB, No Call#CONFIDENCE = #RAS1 = Relative allele signal for the data in the first probe group#RAS2 = Relative allele signal for the data in the second probe group#P-VALUE AA = #P-VALUE AB = #P-VALUE BB = #P-VALUE NO CALL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	RAS1	RAS2	P-VALUE AA	P-VALUE AB	P-VALUE BB	P-VALUE NO CALLAFFX-5Q-123	No Call	862.5	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-456	No Call	702	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-789	No Call	1236.5	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-ABC	No Call	1835.5	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeA	No Call	307.5	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeB	No Call	536.5	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeC	No Call	144	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeD	No Call	165	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeE	No Call	222	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeF	No Call	196.5	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeG	No Call	183.5	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeH	No Call	272	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeI	No Call	263	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeJ	No Call	206	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeK	No Call	236	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeL	No Call	226.5	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeM	No Call	202	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeN	No Call	336	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeO	No Call	211.5	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeP	No Call	310	0	0	0	0	0	0!sample_table_end
