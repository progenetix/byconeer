A general linear regression model (Macgregor S, Visscher PM, Montgomery G, Analysis of pooled DNA samples on high density arrays without prior knowledge of differential hybridization rates. Nucleic Acids Res 2006; 34(7):e55) was used to identify differences between pools and calculate a z-score (the p-value of the z-test) for each SNP-pool comparison.  The data table linked to GSE17574 contains the calculated z-score for each SNP comparing case pools to control pools.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Paul,J.,Isackson!Sample_contact_email = isackson@buffalo.edu!Sample_contact_department = Pediatrics!Sample_contact_institute = University at Buffalo!Sample_contact_address = 100 High St!Sample_contact_city = Buffalo!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14203!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM437nnn/GSM437971/suppl/GSM437971_StatinmyopathyC1_H.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM437nnn/GSM437971/suppl/GSM437971_StatinmyopathyC2_H.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE17574!Sample_data_row_count = 49017#ID_REF = #VALUE = GTYPE SNP intensity signal!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1658633	0.408591SNP_A-1669946	0.629265SNP_A-1691463	0.447706SNP_A-1647681	0.497144SNP_A-1691255	0.59822SNP_A-1656886	0.106594SNP_A-1673751	0.199563SNP_A-1641890	0.891064SNP_A-1656716	0.955174SNP_A-1664559	0.81402SNP_A-1747116	0.303297SNP_A-1657969	0.337209SNP_A-1716436	0.65369SNP_A-1664341	0.252151SNP_A-1715866	0.737154SNP_A-1750090	0.315651SNP_A-1655302	0.29926SNP_A-1655176	0.015338SNP_A-1647119	0.925803SNP_A-1749896	0.849229!sample_table_end
