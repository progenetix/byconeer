A general linear regression model (Macgregor S, Visscher PM, Montgomery G, Analysis of pooled DNA samples on high density arrays without prior knowledge of differential hybridization rates. Nucleic Acids Res 2006; 34(7):e55) was used to identify differences between pools and calculate a z-score (the p-value of the z-test) for each SNP-pool comparison.  The data table linked to GSE17574 contains the calculated z-score for each SNP comparing case pools to control pools.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Paul,J.,Isackson!Sample_contact_email = isackson@buffalo.edu!Sample_contact_department = Pediatrics!Sample_contact_institute = University at Buffalo!Sample_contact_address = 100 High St!Sample_contact_city = Buffalo!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14203!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM437nnn/GSM437973/suppl/GSM437973_StatinmyopathyC1_X.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM437nnn/GSM437973/suppl/GSM437973_StatinmyopathyC2_X.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE17574!Sample_data_row_count = 53816#ID_REF = #VALUE = GTYPE SNP intensity signal!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1643131	0.263909SNP_A-1708186	0.831602SNP_A-1679806	0.742321SNP_A-1687400	0.275962SNP_A-1701699	0.118568SNP_A-1734642	0.521624SNP_A-1705081	0.725497SNP_A-1748913	0.37141SNP_A-1659730	0.575771SNP_A-1755914	0.181661SNP_A-1681384	0.169316SNP_A-1728267	0.628551SNP_A-1708763	0.203359SNP_A-1719311	0.36332SNP_A-1741675	0.520957SNP_A-1686722	0.807295SNP_A-1717655	0.361399SNP_A-1704403	0.050604SNP_A-1683756	0.842323SNP_A-1673926	0.065697!sample_table_end
