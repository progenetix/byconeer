The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751575/suppl/GSM751575_TLL_ALL_1238_REM_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751575/suppl/GSM751575_TLL_ALL_1238_REM_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.003469	AB	0.042276	11.091522AFFX-656757	AA	0.004259	AA	0.835365	12.700402AFFX-721431	AA	0.022731	AA	0.895582	12.982080AFFX-737848	BB	0.045425	BB	-0.660827	11.440083AFFX-1329481	BB	0.039136	BB	-0.815601	13.713484AFFX-1375402	AB	0.001680	AB	-0.266911	11.720703AFFX-1987483	AA	0.000956	AA	0.737115	12.610550AFFX-2208108	BB	0.018967	BB	-0.822487	11.730827AFFX-2343975	BB	0.004419	BB	-0.816088	11.913855AFFX-2436931	BB	0.002128	BB	-0.766975	11.893081AFFX-2557092	BB	0.001259	BB	-0.859046	12.568903AFFX-2629782	BB	0.028369	BB	-0.818777	11.695585AFFX-335883	BB	0.001439	BB	-0.730335	12.071514AFFX-2147527	AA	0.012133	AA	0.780200	12.381729AFFX-532031	AB	0.000693	AB	0.127478	13.568410AFFX-811529	BB	0.041173	BB	-0.823850	14.207458AFFX-1304348	AA	0.010673	AA	0.777595	12.301237AFFX-1852733	BB	0.004109	BB	-0.726330	12.522233AFFX-2126602	AB	0.001756	AB	-0.337760	12.340659AFFX-2899757	AB	0.000571	AB	0.052008	12.229817!sample_table_end
