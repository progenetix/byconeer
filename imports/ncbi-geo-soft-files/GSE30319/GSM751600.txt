The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751600/suppl/GSM751600_TLL_ALL_1BD_Xba.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751600/suppl/GSM751600_TLL_ALL_1BD_Xba.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	BB	0.250771	BB	-0.685970	11.112858AFFX-656757	AB	0.061397	AB	-0.010485	12.404007AFFX-721431	NC	0.612856	AA	0.700405	11.441206AFFX-737848	AB	0.052426	AB	0.015778	11.075407AFFX-1329481	AA	0.122569	AA	0.819397	12.755475AFFX-1375402	AB	0.046223	AB	0.012192	11.701902AFFX-1987483	BB	0.094775	BB	-0.732288	12.287536AFFX-2208108	AB	0.024686	AB	-0.048552	11.201170AFFX-2343975	AA	0.148272	AA	0.784903	11.405160AFFX-2436931	BB	0.107185	BB	-0.651215	11.005919AFFX-2557092	AA	0.301516	AA	0.855547	12.757521AFFX-2629782	AA	0.270145	AA	0.516427	11.250160AFFX-335883	AB	0.064458	AB	0.153041	12.069491AFFX-2147527	AA	0.147286	AA	0.804272	11.408088AFFX-532031	AB	0.073566	AB	-0.123370	12.863881AFFX-811529	AB	0.046332	AB	0.114585	13.135507AFFX-1304348	AA	0.096254	AA	0.881826	12.581153AFFX-1852733	AB	0.179025	AB	0.128044	11.895738AFFX-2126602	AB	0.213874	AB	-0.477654	12.022219AFFX-2899757	AB	0.071012	AB	-0.246789	12.082254!sample_table_end
