The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751619/suppl/GSM751619_TLL_ALL_2NP_REM_Xba.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751619/suppl/GSM751619_TLL_ALL_2NP_REM_Xba.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.000762	AB	0.039092	12.036317AFFX-656757	AA	0.000559	AA	0.879808	13.363594AFFX-721431	AB	0.002539	AB	0.328608	12.419297AFFX-737848	AB	0.012496	AB	-0.142893	11.808722AFFX-1329481	BB	0.013782	BB	-0.883857	13.606112AFFX-1375402	AB	0.000807	AB	-0.269401	12.487067AFFX-1987483	AA	0.024874	AA	0.843950	13.207526AFFX-2208108	AB	0.008543	AB	0.107306	11.867292AFFX-2343975	AA	0.002151	AA	0.872672	12.196549AFFX-2436931	BB	0.003586	BB	-0.870393	12.349811AFFX-2557092	AA	0.004968	AA	0.958259	13.845963AFFX-2629782	BB	0.000728	BB	-0.870896	12.550200AFFX-335883	AA	0.013560	AA	0.933802	13.733838AFFX-2147527	AA	0.011403	AA	0.898012	12.631297AFFX-532031	AA	0.004232	AA	0.881606	13.985282AFFX-811529	AA	0.020748	AA	0.887588	13.868146AFFX-1304348	AA	0.000392	AA	0.890744	13.240927AFFX-1852733	AA	0.004700	AA	0.739535	12.911047AFFX-2126602	BB	0.003694	BB	-0.923736	13.770735AFFX-2899757	AB	0.001926	AB	-0.030298	12.708524!sample_table_end
