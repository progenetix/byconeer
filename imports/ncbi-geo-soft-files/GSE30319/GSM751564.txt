The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751564/suppl/GSM751564_TLL_ALL_1BDp2_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751564/suppl/GSM751564_TLL_ALL_1BDp2_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	BB	0.036147	BB	-0.761585	11.160352AFFX-656757	AB	0.000301	AB	-0.209859	12.884021AFFX-721431	AA	0.009429	AA	0.883897	12.852240AFFX-737848	AB	0.155486	AB	0.350847	11.647891AFFX-1329481	AA	0.001200	AA	0.828421	13.241689AFFX-1375402	AB	0.000610	AB	-0.278016	11.841134AFFX-1987483	BB	0.078569	BB	-0.485474	12.802547AFFX-2208108	AB	0.004722	AB	-0.119413	11.546176AFFX-2343975	AA	0.068906	AA	0.803860	11.472543AFFX-2436931	BB	0.006363	BB	-0.796323	11.896665AFFX-2557092	AA	0.014549	AA	0.930579	13.260606AFFX-2629782	AA	0.053769	AA	0.773776	11.045910AFFX-335883	AB	0.007594	AB	0.080191	12.455559AFFX-2147527	AA	0.021104	AA	0.831139	12.653505AFFX-532031	AB	0.003713	AB	0.186617	13.522050AFFX-811529	AB	0.002812	AB	-0.053405	13.816973AFFX-1304348	AA	0.015180	AA	0.783597	12.291701AFFX-1852733	AB	0.003034	AB	-0.127174	12.422449AFFX-2126602	AB	0.000136	AB	-0.341085	12.493867AFFX-2899757	AA	0.015494	AA	0.864272	12.087297!sample_table_end
