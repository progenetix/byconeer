The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751595/suppl/GSM751595_TLL_ALL_1520_Xba.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751595/suppl/GSM751595_TLL_ALL_1520_Xba.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.010485	AB	0.209543	12.429204AFFX-656757	AB	0.003906	AB	-0.114933	13.955913AFFX-721431	AA	0.004460	AA	0.913863	12.947757AFFX-737848	AB	0.001325	AB	-0.053551	12.424576AFFX-1329481	BB	0.005260	BB	-0.868808	13.959690AFFX-1375402	AB	0.000516	AB	-0.274203	12.445208AFFX-1987483	BB	0.005245	BB	-0.768128	13.208021AFFX-2208108	AB	0.003954	AB	0.082769	12.460288AFFX-2343975	AB	0.000506	AB	-0.032687	12.615230AFFX-2436931	BB	0.000685	BB	-0.830978	12.314720AFFX-2557092	AA	0.015148	AA	0.950829	14.056220AFFX-2629782	AA	0.006662	AA	0.890543	12.153608AFFX-335883	AB	0.006658	AB	0.350198	13.192983AFFX-2147527	BB	0.003151	BB	-0.833917	12.926029AFFX-532031	AB	0.001810	AB	0.093587	13.913754AFFX-811529	AA	0.002510	AA	0.862818	14.134900AFFX-1304348	AA	0.016423	AA	0.870279	13.432342AFFX-1852733	AA	0.008932	AA	0.697407	13.128989AFFX-2126602	AB	0.003462	AB	-0.415368	13.634735AFFX-2899757	BB	0.033759	BB	-0.839277	12.996562!sample_table_end
