The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751597/suppl/GSM751597_TLL_ALL_1870p2_Xba.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751597/suppl/GSM751597_TLL_ALL_1870p2_Xba.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.013036	AB	0.139259	11.782494AFFX-656757	AA	0.009068	AA	0.909222	13.304628AFFX-721431	AA	0.030319	AA	0.892348	12.534351AFFX-737848	AB	0.001211	AB	0.017647	12.439637AFFX-1329481	AB	0.002633	AB	0.076743	13.781238AFFX-1375402	AB	0.002566	AB	-0.258860	12.166452AFFX-1987483	AB	0.000890	AB	0.090122	13.338874AFFX-2208108	AB	0.004486	AB	-0.024247	11.744883AFFX-2343975	AA	0.011327	AA	0.874795	11.993370AFFX-2436931	BB	0.000740	BB	-0.865925	12.474333AFFX-2557092	AA	0.041417	AA	0.939944	13.452978AFFX-2629782	AB	0.043749	AB	-0.495601	12.348027AFFX-335883	AA	0.001529	AA	0.915022	13.556223AFFX-2147527	AA	0.000882	AA	0.880703	12.745630AFFX-532031	AA	0.007369	AA	0.899252	13.968309AFFX-811529	BB	0.056484	BB	-0.845336	14.087271AFFX-1304348	AB	0.007981	AB	0.245282	13.321379AFFX-1852733	AB	0.005111	AB	-0.175748	13.369631AFFX-2126602	AB	0.005110	AB	-0.431073	13.178451AFFX-2899757	BB	0.104090	BB	-0.774189	11.788665!sample_table_end
