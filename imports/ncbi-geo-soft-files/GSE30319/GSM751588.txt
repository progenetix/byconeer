The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751588/suppl/GSM751588_TLL_ALL_10SA_REM_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751588/suppl/GSM751588_TLL_ALL_10SA_REM_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.243422	AB	-0.169624	10.451128AFFX-656757	AB	0.020806	AB	-0.286580	12.495462AFFX-721431	AA	0.006635	AA	0.837014	12.683599AFFX-737848	AB	0.050700	AB	0.124522	10.984098AFFX-1329481	AB	0.006369	AB	0.036845	12.929364AFFX-1375402	AA	0.005959	AA	0.693932	11.392441AFFX-1987483	AA	0.111782	AA	0.706813	12.014320AFFX-2208108	BB	0.044217	BB	-0.756632	10.962409AFFX-2343975	AB	0.427147	AB	-0.451044	11.260887AFFX-2436931	BB	0.023425	BB	-0.740238	11.532591AFFX-2557092	AA	0.101416	AA	0.898422	12.692831AFFX-2629782	BB	0.014487	BB	-0.759222	11.494522AFFX-335883	BB	0.024993	BB	-0.811736	11.994969AFFX-2147527	AB	0.064451	AB	0.334992	11.915573AFFX-532031	AB	0.004375	AB	0.035143	13.258967AFFX-811529	AB	0.000704	AB	-0.025681	13.435065AFFX-1304348	AA	0.018746	AA	0.792172	12.341316AFFX-1852733	BB	0.034359	BB	-0.688676	12.256576AFFX-2126602	BB	0.000898	BB	-0.845763	12.750113AFFX-2899757	AB	0.068523	AB	0.156783	11.526987!sample_table_end
