The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751598/suppl/GSM751598_TLL_ALL_1928p2_Xba.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751598/suppl/GSM751598_TLL_ALL_1928p2_Xba.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.002682	AB	0.004900	12.509612AFFX-656757	AA	0.004937	AA	0.912470	13.620087AFFX-721431	AA	0.034229	AA	0.891777	13.139410AFFX-737848	BB	0.006686	BB	-0.858673	12.301036AFFX-1329481	AA	0.029824	AA	0.868527	14.132332AFFX-1375402	BB	0.054496	BB	-0.881820	12.759320AFFX-1987483	AA	0.007080	AA	0.877090	13.545344AFFX-2208108	BB	0.009420	BB	-0.928611	12.516152AFFX-2343975	AA	0.032838	AA	0.908577	12.627803AFFX-2436931	AB	0.005122	AB	0.436124	13.066796AFFX-2557092	AA	0.038952	AA	0.958995	14.221210AFFX-2629782	AA	0.009804	AA	0.877866	11.942263AFFX-335883	AA	0.002133	AA	0.895177	13.425212AFFX-2147527	AA	0.003704	AA	0.893495	13.010147AFFX-532031	AB	0.000869	AB	0.053983	13.788855AFFX-811529	AB	0.002602	AB	-0.048122	14.684644AFFX-1304348	AB	0.000871	AB	0.087825	13.627380AFFX-1852733	AB	0.011707	AB	-0.251771	13.648722AFFX-2126602	BB	0.008796	BB	-0.904977	13.750122AFFX-2899757	AB	0.003763	AB	-0.003229	13.124874!sample_table_end
