The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751594/suppl/GSM751594_TLL_ALL_1433_Xba.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751594/suppl/GSM751594_TLL_ALL_1433_Xba.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.016100	AB	-0.168168	12.390461AFFX-656757	AB	0.000462	AB	-0.193836	13.771619AFFX-721431	BB	0.001608	BB	-0.871527	12.225712AFFX-737848	AB	0.000758	AB	0.033488	12.297524AFFX-1329481	BB	0.006495	BB	-0.889808	14.007718AFFX-1375402	BB	0.000799	BB	-0.899825	12.439877AFFX-1987483	BB	0.007682	BB	-0.835972	13.536002AFFX-2208108	BB	0.014575	BB	-0.898267	12.493319AFFX-2343975	AB	0.000202	AB	-0.047610	12.578357AFFX-2436931	BB	0.009544	BB	-0.808794	11.991678AFFX-2557092	AA	0.022118	AA	0.945453	14.091479AFFX-2629782	AB	0.000241	AB	-0.317364	12.337246AFFX-335883	AB	0.001765	AB	0.296248	13.372083AFFX-2147527	AA	0.005927	AA	0.857812	12.875781AFFX-532031	AB	0.000952	AB	0.060919	14.045281AFFX-811529	BB	0.000840	BB	-0.879444	14.579463AFFX-1304348	AA	0.000397	AA	0.890962	13.263956AFFX-1852733	AA	0.025589	AA	0.817962	13.126688AFFX-2126602	AA	0.001149	AA	0.884552	13.055105AFFX-2899757	BB	0.003195	BB	-0.870830	12.761253!sample_table_end
