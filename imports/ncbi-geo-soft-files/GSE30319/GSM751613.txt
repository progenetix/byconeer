The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751613/suppl/GSM751613_TLL_ALL_1520_REM_Xba.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751613/suppl/GSM751613_TLL_ALL_1520_REM_Xba.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.001796	AB	0.116369	12.204034AFFX-656757	AB	0.000251	AB	-0.200317	13.692912AFFX-721431	AA	0.000932	AA	0.892265	12.873147AFFX-737848	AB	0.000385	AB	-0.026076	12.132126AFFX-1329481	BB	0.002199	BB	-0.879627	13.920571AFFX-1375402	AB	0.001086	AB	-0.217478	12.231642AFFX-1987483	BB	0.013770	BB	-0.776181	13.485267AFFX-2208108	AB	0.000825	AB	0.049016	12.248247AFFX-2343975	AB	0.001765	AB	-0.134049	12.390323AFFX-2436931	BB	0.000532	BB	-0.847716	12.485291AFFX-2557092	AA	0.046198	AA	0.952786	14.240808AFFX-2629782	AA	0.004129	AA	0.847993	12.199000AFFX-335883	AB	0.000388	AB	0.262364	13.328612AFFX-2147527	BB	0.004112	BB	-0.856521	12.862601AFFX-532031	AB	0.001798	AB	-0.001603	14.147218AFFX-811529	AA	0.001267	AA	0.878492	14.241835AFFX-1304348	AA	0.002124	AA	0.898932	13.232120AFFX-1852733	AA	0.010148	AA	0.756262	12.899148AFFX-2126602	AB	0.000101	AB	-0.406824	13.411925AFFX-2899757	BB	0.006309	BB	-0.858411	12.833079!sample_table_end
