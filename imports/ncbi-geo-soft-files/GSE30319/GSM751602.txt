The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751602/suppl/GSM751602_TLL_ALL_3MMp2_Xba.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751602/suppl/GSM751602_TLL_ALL_3MMp2_Xba.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.039848	AB	-0.172413	11.291915AFFX-656757	AB	0.029532	AB	0.166066	13.878399AFFX-721431	AB	0.023054	AB	0.462685	12.359215AFFX-737848	AB	0.024416	AB	0.193120	12.028961AFFX-1329481	AB	0.001409	AB	-0.039367	14.073366AFFX-1375402	BB	0.134372	BB	-0.892880	11.870064AFFX-1987483	AA	0.087648	AA	0.756535	13.526938AFFX-2208108	BB	0.031048	BB	-0.899260	11.901536AFFX-2343975	BB	0.088107	BB	-0.795385	11.846673AFFX-2436931	AB	0.012502	AB	0.503089	12.749578AFFX-2557092	AA	0.185760	AA	0.919136	12.985855AFFX-2629782	AB	0.072457	AB	-0.504901	12.014410AFFX-335883	BB	0.067836	BB	-0.854800	12.139045AFFX-2147527	AA	0.002524	AA	0.890395	12.975915AFFX-532031	AB	0.000231	AB	0.019854	14.003730AFFX-811529	AA	0.035626	AA	0.908095	14.669168AFFX-1304348	AB	0.001189	AB	0.167403	13.372537AFFX-1852733	BB	0.057902	BB	-0.803853	13.468543AFFX-2126602	AB	0.199169	AB	-0.546840	12.333455AFFX-2899757	AB	0.027901	AB	-0.015227	11.782843!sample_table_end
