The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751608/suppl/GSM751608_TLL_ALL_13BP_Xba.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751608/suppl/GSM751608_TLL_ALL_13BP_Xba.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	BB	0.010269	BB	-0.920702	12.173702AFFX-656757	AA	0.006024	AA	0.855631	13.452137AFFX-721431	AB	0.012253	AB	0.433676	12.384670AFFX-737848	AA	0.014053	AA	0.904867	12.377936AFFX-1329481	AA	0.001642	AA	0.848330	13.655704AFFX-1375402	AA	0.017167	AA	0.870679	11.893599AFFX-1987483	BB	0.003341	BB	-0.829002	13.263530AFFX-2208108	BB	0.005861	BB	-0.938555	12.371162AFFX-2343975	AA	0.016923	AA	0.932187	12.457469AFFX-2436931	BB	0.000273	BB	-0.846853	12.356850AFFX-2557092	AA	0.001784	AA	0.945603	13.888222AFFX-2629782	AB	0.001353	AB	-0.339876	12.381859AFFX-335883	AB	0.001187	AB	0.202979	13.287252AFFX-2147527	AA	0.032418	AA	0.919506	13.412460AFFX-532031	AA	0.022118	AA	0.825290	14.016740AFFX-811529	AB	0.037686	AB	0.239947	14.661101AFFX-1304348	AA	0.000736	AA	0.874733	13.228961AFFX-1852733	AA	0.000115	AA	0.725577	13.020428AFFX-2126602	BB	0.059599	BB	-0.912769	14.091935AFFX-2899757	AB	0.003509	AB	0.084503	13.110603!sample_table_end
