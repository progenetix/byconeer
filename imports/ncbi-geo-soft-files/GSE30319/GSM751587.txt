The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751587/suppl/GSM751587_TLL_ALL_9AMp2_REM_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751587/suppl/GSM751587_TLL_ALL_9AMp2_REM_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.033598	AB	-0.006910	10.746534AFFX-656757	AB	0.001524	AB	-0.253384	13.048390AFFX-721431	AB	0.007645	AB	0.338401	12.582115AFFX-737848	AB	0.026192	AB	0.074907	11.082419AFFX-1329481	AA	0.002271	AA	0.834232	13.275519AFFX-1375402	AA	0.019910	AA	0.780438	11.344400AFFX-1987483	AA	0.031607	AA	0.752494	12.995004AFFX-2208108	BB	0.007171	BB	-0.789660	11.592802AFFX-2343975	AA	0.002409	AA	0.874378	12.175545AFFX-2436931	AB	0.071159	AB	0.448086	11.995721AFFX-2557092	BB	0.009556	BB	-0.789348	12.097100AFFX-2629782	AB	0.001396	AB	-0.197055	11.484395AFFX-335883	AB	0.007565	AB	0.239489	12.065997AFFX-2147527	AA	0.027477	AA	0.750321	12.112779AFFX-532031	AB	0.004959	AB	-0.005637	13.470531AFFX-811529	AB	0.004717	AB	0.053434	13.314258AFFX-1304348	AA	0.070145	AA	0.826308	12.269340AFFX-1852733	AB	0.011210	AB	-0.018974	12.500570AFFX-2126602	BB	0.016230	BB	-0.856332	12.596767AFFX-2899757	BB	0.005285	BB	-0.729364	12.137713!sample_table_end
