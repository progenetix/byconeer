The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751580/suppl/GSM751580_TLL_ALL_1928p2_REM_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751580/suppl/GSM751580_TLL_ALL_1928p2_REM_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.015059	AB	0.169970	11.263773AFFX-656757	AA	0.005809	AA	0.812382	12.946104AFFX-721431	AA	0.003971	AA	0.863439	12.769759AFFX-737848	BB	0.030758	BB	-0.753223	11.898542AFFX-1329481	AA	0.031659	AA	0.830622	13.621915AFFX-1375402	BB	0.031764	BB	-0.789230	11.934913AFFX-1987483	AA	0.073396	AA	0.673254	12.795074AFFX-2208108	BB	0.039945	BB	-0.795038	11.833325AFFX-2343975	AA	0.006399	AA	0.886767	12.272285AFFX-2436931	AB	0.005200	AB	0.342246	12.619089AFFX-2557092	AA	0.052399	AA	0.918987	13.365660AFFX-2629782	AA	0.199936	AA	0.522340	11.468314AFFX-335883	AA	0.040058	AA	0.756312	12.419707AFFX-2147527	AA	0.009784	AA	0.822917	12.555826AFFX-532031	AB	0.000099	AB	0.090063	13.470276AFFX-811529	AB	0.011055	AB	0.011177	14.144387AFFX-1304348	AB	0.016590	AB	0.297523	12.494624AFFX-1852733	AB	0.018521	AB	-0.179464	13.130071AFFX-2126602	BB	0.011761	BB	-0.858550	12.887585AFFX-2899757	AB	0.002868	AB	0.104634	12.496743!sample_table_end
