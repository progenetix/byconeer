The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751610/suppl/GSM751610_TLL_ALL_1015_REM_Xba.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751610/suppl/GSM751610_TLL_ALL_1015_REM_Xba.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	BB	0.079623	BB	-0.914912	12.742171AFFX-656757	AA	0.003409	AA	0.891774	13.621256AFFX-721431	AB	0.028179	AB	0.328348	13.366939AFFX-737848	AB	0.009009	AB	0.030485	12.835553AFFX-1329481	AB	0.009122	AB	0.051430	14.473313AFFX-1375402	AB	0.014837	AB	-0.181561	12.939786AFFX-1987483	AB	0.019360	AB	0.130791	14.038368AFFX-2208108	AB	0.019132	AB	0.033466	13.123971AFFX-2343975	AB	0.010923	AB	-0.042022	13.135959AFFX-2436931	BB	0.020004	BB	-0.916435	13.039953AFFX-2557092	AB	0.011349	AB	0.352566	14.147764AFFX-2629782	AB	0.028722	AB	-0.187327	13.054532AFFX-335883	BB	0.026723	BB	-0.897169	13.787144AFFX-2147527	AA	0.038089	AA	0.891290	13.389309AFFX-532031	AA	0.020302	AA	0.849520	14.122409AFFX-811529	AA	0.018981	AA	0.883216	14.490854AFFX-1304348	AB	0.004373	AB	0.105834	13.885418AFFX-1852733	AA	0.026993	AA	0.790493	13.596096AFFX-2126602	BB	0.032919	BB	-0.904927	13.920131AFFX-2899757	BB	0.026240	BB	-0.881360	13.072721!sample_table_end
