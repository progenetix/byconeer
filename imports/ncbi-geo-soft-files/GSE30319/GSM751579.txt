The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751579/suppl/GSM751579_TLL_ALL_1870_REM_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751579/suppl/GSM751579_TLL_ALL_1870_REM_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.060735	AB	0.107259	10.568790AFFX-656757	AA	0.007572	AA	0.871707	12.843505AFFX-721431	AA	0.033114	AA	0.875058	12.465887AFFX-737848	AB	0.005023	AB	-0.055327	11.854252AFFX-1329481	AB	0.001391	AB	-0.027213	13.343251AFFX-1375402	AB	0.010954	AB	-0.310145	11.584658AFFX-1987483	AB	0.007096	AB	0.074948	12.606644AFFX-2208108	AB	0.022105	AB	0.171964	11.570578AFFX-2343975	AA	0.041881	AA	0.874964	11.756955AFFX-2436931	BB	0.009842	BB	-0.801978	11.862372AFFX-2557092	AA	0.020110	AA	0.911622	12.910979AFFX-2629782	AB	0.085753	AB	-0.350083	11.285997AFFX-335883	AA	0.002283	AA	0.766003	12.191969AFFX-2147527	AA	0.005168	AA	0.833405	12.420457AFFX-532031	AA	0.002452	AA	0.883057	13.347802AFFX-811529	BB	0.003923	BB	-0.804965	13.822075AFFX-1304348	AB	0.000777	AB	0.175368	12.260409AFFX-1852733	AB	0.008006	AB	-0.168491	12.934260AFFX-2126602	AB	0.047685	AB	-0.495315	12.486846AFFX-2899757	BB	0.007723	BB	-0.807784	12.236862!sample_table_end
