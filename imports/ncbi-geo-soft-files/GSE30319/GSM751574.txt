The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751574/suppl/GSM751574_TLL_ALL_1015p2_REM_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751574/suppl/GSM751574_TLL_ALL_1015p2_REM_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	BB	0.034318	BB	-0.700190	10.842226AFFX-656757	AA	0.002734	AA	0.808935	12.850521AFFX-721431	AB	0.000686	AB	0.224711	12.436124AFFX-737848	AB	0.002728	AB	0.081931	11.610494AFFX-1329481	AB	0.014625	AB	0.016144	13.750745AFFX-1375402	AB	0.001884	AB	-0.247065	12.009548AFFX-1987483	AB	0.049111	AB	0.254262	13.092303AFFX-2208108	AB	0.010698	AB	-0.098752	12.010210AFFX-2343975	AB	0.007122	AB	-0.156086	11.922650AFFX-2436931	BB	0.003184	BB	-0.814420	12.164361AFFX-2557092	AB	0.004484	AB	0.368873	13.096009AFFX-2629782	AB	0.031156	AB	-0.254097	11.210011AFFX-335883	BB	0.003038	BB	-0.709766	12.043193AFFX-2147527	AA	0.008750	AA	0.778380	12.187040AFFX-532031	AA	0.025533	AA	0.876838	13.087035AFFX-811529	AA	0.044055	AA	0.856415	13.922278AFFX-1304348	AB	0.004283	AB	0.209113	12.168609AFFX-1852733	AA	0.040295	AA	0.781401	13.048639AFFX-2126602	BB	0.032449	BB	-0.848107	12.499584AFFX-2899757	BB	0.000828	BB	-0.770314	12.258735!sample_table_end
