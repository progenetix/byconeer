The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751606/suppl/GSM751606_TLL_ALL_10SA_Xba.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751606/suppl/GSM751606_TLL_ALL_10SA_Xba.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.128405	AB	0.332631	11.559746AFFX-656757	AB	0.013368	AB	-0.152789	14.272952AFFX-721431	AA	0.001368	AA	0.902966	12.834626AFFX-737848	AB	0.005586	AB	0.002703	12.722266AFFX-1329481	AB	0.002962	AB	-0.086847	14.058417AFFX-1375402	AA	0.012721	AA	0.885178	12.499324AFFX-1987483	AA	0.086885	AA	0.817061	13.945549AFFX-2208108	BB	0.000737	BB	-0.912301	12.240839AFFX-2343975	AB	0.000054	AB	-0.050317	12.465475AFFX-2436931	BB	0.011078	BB	-0.866591	12.813450AFFX-2557092	AA	0.060382	AA	0.901827	13.331179AFFX-2629782	BB	0.034168	BB	-0.907752	12.902071AFFX-335883	BB	0.015846	BB	-0.853829	12.659034AFFX-2147527	AB	0.010967	AB	-0.191268	13.385392AFFX-532031	AB	0.002448	AB	0.005368	14.202173AFFX-811529	AB	0.005894	AB	-0.116277	14.860576AFFX-1304348	AA	0.000066	AA	0.881186	13.234633AFFX-1852733	BB	0.015549	BB	-0.890791	13.440582AFFX-2126602	BB	0.055513	BB	-0.906170	13.234959AFFX-2899757	AB	0.006913	AB	-0.066728	12.450790!sample_table_end
