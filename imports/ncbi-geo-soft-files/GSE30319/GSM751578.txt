The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751578/suppl/GSM751578_TLL_ALL_1847_REM_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751578/suppl/GSM751578_TLL_ALL_1847_REM_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.034212	AB	0.050480	10.700908AFFX-656757	AA	0.002076	AA	0.835817	12.750195AFFX-721431	AA	0.003375	AA	0.870655	12.656491AFFX-737848	AB	0.001747	AB	-0.029186	11.762815AFFX-1329481	AB	0.005891	AB	-0.130697	13.444678AFFX-1375402	AB	0.101299	AB	-0.386833	11.208177AFFX-1987483	BB	0.084049	BB	-0.499025	12.917976AFFX-2208108	AB	0.014025	AB	-0.023878	11.062245AFFX-2343975	AA	0.035796	AA	0.847267	11.702229AFFX-2436931	BB	0.000163	BB	-0.771388	11.999301AFFX-2557092	AB	0.000149	AB	0.423175	12.874966AFFX-2629782	BB	0.058322	BB	-0.751120	11.302575AFFX-335883	BB	0.002354	BB	-0.752876	12.106668AFFX-2147527	AB	0.000311	AB	0.095410	12.341659AFFX-532031	AA	0.004825	AA	0.886985	13.319938AFFX-811529	BB	0.024500	BB	-0.830017	14.106798AFFX-1304348	AB	0.023162	AB	0.318897	12.294033AFFX-1852733	AA	0.004852	AA	0.676872	12.685953AFFX-2126602	AB	0.008042	AB	-0.404825	12.355009AFFX-2899757	AA	0.006263	AA	0.838850	12.078642!sample_table_end
