The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751614/suppl/GSM751614_TLL_ALL_1847_REM_Xba.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751614/suppl/GSM751614_TLL_ALL_1847_REM_Xba.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.093920	AB	-0.321963	11.497040AFFX-656757	AA	0.032277	AA	0.893411	12.959563AFFX-721431	AA	0.003987	AA	0.906254	12.799988AFFX-737848	AB	0.021937	AB	-0.217848	11.920340AFFX-1329481	AB	0.005128	AB	-0.026104	13.369466AFFX-1375402	AB	0.017424	AB	-0.181313	11.766695AFFX-1987483	BB	0.028573	BB	-0.861154	13.038034AFFX-2208108	AB	0.080639	AB	-0.320667	11.207578AFFX-2343975	AA	0.125818	AA	0.818418	11.413283AFFX-2436931	BB	0.006729	BB	-0.904102	12.698285AFFX-2557092	AB	0.017871	AB	0.323648	12.854029AFFX-2629782	BB	0.312791	BB	-0.799790	11.742570AFFX-335883	BB	0.001750	BB	-0.911260	13.340963AFFX-2147527	AB	0.335091	AB	0.423251	12.033195AFFX-532031	AA	0.071716	AA	0.904168	13.302436AFFX-811529	BB	0.021208	BB	-0.916449	14.567156AFFX-1304348	AB	0.016694	AB	-0.048512	13.081961AFFX-1852733	AA	0.186980	AA	0.578981	12.030749AFFX-2126602	AB	0.016593	AB	-0.447408	12.995464AFFX-2899757	AA	0.082926	AA	0.840907	12.016394!sample_table_end
