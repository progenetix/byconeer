The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751592/suppl/GSM751592_TLL_ALL_1015p2_Xba.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751592/suppl/GSM751592_TLL_ALL_1015p2_Xba.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	BB	0.033471	BB	-0.857314	11.568402AFFX-656757	AA	0.004339	AA	0.899995	13.336804AFFX-721431	AB	0.002427	AB	0.366037	12.785680AFFX-737848	AB	0.018596	AB	0.100527	11.721611AFFX-1329481	AB	0.011895	AB	0.007336	13.136165AFFX-1375402	AB	0.024611	AB	-0.272827	11.772660AFFX-1987483	AB	0.002782	AB	0.180117	13.311135AFFX-2208108	AB	0.002640	AB	-0.109143	12.044238AFFX-2343975	AB	0.005076	AB	0.043393	12.122854AFFX-2436931	BB	0.009386	BB	-0.831639	12.040370AFFX-2557092	AB	0.019548	AB	0.355732	14.354306AFFX-2629782	AB	0.019090	AB	-0.153945	11.844505AFFX-335883	BB	0.018215	BB	-0.936495	13.772095AFFX-2147527	AA	0.004242	AA	0.853995	12.769357AFFX-532031	AA	0.072692	AA	0.810713	13.113899AFFX-811529	AA	0.050091	AA	0.882201	14.686583AFFX-1304348	AB	0.015451	AB	0.171556	14.203783AFFX-1852733	AA	0.003671	AA	0.740627	12.936077AFFX-2126602	BB	0.197895	BB	-0.875237	12.864822AFFX-2899757	BB	0.011900	BB	-0.828918	12.347147!sample_table_end
