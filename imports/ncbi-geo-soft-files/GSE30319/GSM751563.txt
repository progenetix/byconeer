The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751563/suppl/GSM751563_TLL_ALL_2422_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751563/suppl/GSM751563_TLL_ALL_2422_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.014176	AB	-0.056060	11.640929AFFX-656757	AA	0.005572	AA	0.864880	13.054058AFFX-721431	AB	0.011934	AB	0.077787	12.461791AFFX-737848	AB	0.015818	AB	-0.154335	11.587976AFFX-1329481	AB	0.064659	AB	0.188528	12.632722AFFX-1375402	AA	0.064659	AA	0.800527	12.087625AFFX-1987483	BB	0.029850	BB	-0.664608	12.511833AFFX-2208108	AB	0.000813	AB	0.026301	11.614652AFFX-2343975	AB	0.050309	AB	0.274587	12.140385AFFX-2436931	AB	0.017254	AB	0.122239	12.429600AFFX-2557092	AB	0.055880	AB	0.427855	12.122066AFFX-2629782	AB	0.023683	AB	-0.206276	12.097210AFFX-335883	AA	0.004562	AA	0.771773	12.278286AFFX-2147527	AA	0.032967	AA	0.847583	12.752967AFFX-532031	AB	0.010363	AB	0.230054	13.367149AFFX-811529	AB	0.029206	AB	-0.191761	13.078042AFFX-1304348	AA	0.036447	AA	0.789953	12.560797AFFX-1852733	AB	0.023308	AB	-0.281419	12.956630AFFX-2126602	BB	0.076540	BB	-0.885909	13.219801AFFX-2899757	AB	0.046906	AB	0.257286	12.033498!sample_table_end
