The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751572/suppl/GSM751572_TLL_ALL_13BPp2_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751572/suppl/GSM751572_TLL_ALL_13BPp2_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	BB	0.270466	BB	-0.464595	10.747788AFFX-656757	AA	0.009492	AA	0.789130	12.843387AFFX-721431	AB	0.004526	AB	0.251757	12.171176AFFX-737848	AA	0.009049	AA	0.694863	11.551520AFFX-1329481	AA	0.059706	AA	0.833900	13.796153AFFX-1375402	AA	0.019678	AA	0.593982	10.850375AFFX-1987483	BB	0.011868	BB	-0.661529	12.826664AFFX-2208108	BB	0.061969	BB	-0.700387	11.418042AFFX-2343975	AA	0.048743	AA	0.867954	12.595530AFFX-2436931	BB	0.021038	BB	-0.762540	12.384062AFFX-2557092	AA	0.037334	AA	0.870909	12.894906AFFX-2629782	AB	0.018280	AB	-0.137809	11.213655AFFX-335883	AB	0.022188	AB	0.131324	11.544197AFFX-2147527	AA	0.085733	AA	0.716113	12.157449AFFX-532031	AA	0.012368	AA	0.840854	13.480919AFFX-811529	AB	0.072132	AB	0.327356	13.794313AFFX-1304348	AA	0.045300	AA	0.673211	12.064604AFFX-1852733	AA	0.027242	AA	0.731493	12.982633AFFX-2126602	BB	0.131132	BB	-0.808322	12.992159AFFX-2899757	AB	0.000113	AB	0.027682	12.316974!sample_table_end
