The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751591/suppl/GSM751591_TLL_ALL_757_Xba.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751591/suppl/GSM751591_TLL_ALL_757_Xba.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.108599	AB	0.424238	13.528532AFFX-656757	BB	0.145440	BB	-0.932185	14.844740AFFX-721431	AB	0.040576	AB	0.316044	13.567816AFFX-737848	AB	0.006304	AB	-0.104400	12.589828AFFX-1329481	AB	0.015453	AB	0.016335	14.771324AFFX-1375402	AB	0.121323	AB	-0.542869	13.088240AFFX-1987483	BB	0.076503	BB	-0.779894	13.958880AFFX-2208108	BB	0.091679	BB	-0.928619	13.013254AFFX-2343975	AB	0.016659	AB	-0.061765	13.293298AFFX-2436931	AB	0.029182	AB	0.214126	13.447312AFFX-2557092	AA	0.026807	AA	0.905262	13.859303AFFX-2629782	AA	0.017357	AA	0.911642	12.417873AFFX-335883	AA	0.093506	AA	0.867477	12.863759AFFX-2147527	AA	0.092766	AA	0.927895	13.849160AFFX-532031	AB	0.010645	AB	0.114447	14.392773AFFX-811529	AB	0.043257	AB	-0.257727	15.529366AFFX-1304348	AA	0.117709	AA	0.885130	13.912220AFFX-1852733	AA	0.152375	AA	0.618419	13.470767AFFX-2126602	AB	0.020376	AB	-0.303238	14.133367AFFX-2899757	AB	0.015670	AB	0.181940	13.343318!sample_table_end
