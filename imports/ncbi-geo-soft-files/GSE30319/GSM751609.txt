The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751609/suppl/GSM751609_TLL_ALL_757_REM_Xba.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751609/suppl/GSM751609_TLL_ALL_757_REM_Xba.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.007084	AB	0.038835	12.780107AFFX-656757	BB	0.032448	BB	-0.923993	13.655237AFFX-721431	AB	0.007862	AB	0.370663	12.945798AFFX-737848	AB	0.002027	AB	0.059536	12.195140AFFX-1329481	AB	0.004221	AB	0.074824	14.137260AFFX-1375402	AB	0.001016	AB	-0.192987	12.341898AFFX-1987483	BB	0.004490	BB	-0.820301	13.485703AFFX-2208108	BB	0.037459	BB	-0.937990	12.765277AFFX-2343975	AB	0.005098	AB	0.047769	12.857240AFFX-2436931	AB	0.012560	AB	0.308433	13.200850AFFX-2557092	AA	0.030686	AA	0.934641	14.096889AFFX-2629782	AA	0.006046	AA	0.874768	12.241272AFFX-335883	AA	0.003458	AA	0.913050	13.586789AFFX-2147527	AA	0.004401	AA	0.898343	13.023836AFFX-532031	AB	0.000542	AB	0.029498	14.051508AFFX-811529	AB	0.002137	AB	-0.035421	14.629303AFFX-1304348	AA	0.003205	AA	0.864531	13.212604AFFX-1852733	AA	0.002115	AA	0.723103	13.140060AFFX-2126602	AB	0.008056	AB	-0.356272	13.828250AFFX-2899757	AB	0.005801	AB	0.107954	13.188276!sample_table_end
