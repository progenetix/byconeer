The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751596/suppl/GSM751596_TLL_ALL_1847p2_Xba.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751596/suppl/GSM751596_TLL_ALL_1847p2_Xba.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.017749	AB	0.111081	13.122594AFFX-656757	AA	0.137791	AA	0.915119	14.670916AFFX-721431	AA	0.259203	AA	0.944449	14.194445AFFX-737848	AB	0.009904	AB	-0.000891	12.894752AFFX-1329481	AB	0.009136	AB	-0.005331	14.556702AFFX-1375402	AB	0.009000	AB	-0.259948	12.807388AFFX-1987483	BB	0.023825	BB	-0.827715	13.758462AFFX-2208108	AB	0.016483	AB	0.003285	13.069971AFFX-2343975	AA	0.078277	AA	0.909159	12.839774AFFX-2436931	BB	0.029181	BB	-0.895607	13.118294AFFX-2557092	AB	0.022258	AB	0.346078	14.430326AFFX-2629782	BB	0.075079	BB	-0.911231	13.074275AFFX-335883	BB	0.040099	BB	-0.941014	14.068583AFFX-2147527	AB	0.007232	AB	0.032573	13.507357AFFX-532031	AA	0.011706	AA	0.829700	13.935090AFFX-811529	BB	0.185299	BB	-0.887248	15.457259AFFX-1304348	AB	0.023633	AB	0.129222	14.467777AFFX-1852733	AA	0.033272	AA	0.805344	13.664021AFFX-2126602	AB	0.018600	AB	-0.389986	14.017801AFFX-2899757	AA	0.053169	AA	0.901712	13.214068!sample_table_end
