The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751585/suppl/GSM751585_TLL_ALL_5NL_REM_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751585/suppl/GSM751585_TLL_ALL_5NL_REM_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.104511	AB	-0.249253	11.603550AFFX-656757	AA	0.008570	AA	0.844279	13.099742AFFX-721431	AB	0.004787	AB	0.263087	12.680535AFFX-737848	BB	0.020003	BB	-0.686125	11.490972AFFX-1329481	AA	0.029821	AA	0.842194	12.885080AFFX-1375402	BB	0.038747	BB	-0.845985	12.325071AFFX-1987483	AB	0.015555	AB	-0.039034	12.716048AFFX-2208108	AB	0.004365	AB	0.075453	11.661873AFFX-2343975	AB	0.009880	AB	-0.173126	12.242277AFFX-2436931	AB	0.009627	AB	0.347764	12.703538AFFX-2557092	BB	0.002216	BB	-0.841196	12.614260AFFX-2629782	BB	0.043095	BB	-0.777087	12.010085AFFX-335883	BB	0.018758	BB	-0.817841	12.378808AFFX-2147527	AB	0.002428	AB	0.039203	12.522273AFFX-532031	AB	0.000326	AB	0.083613	13.536045AFFX-811529	AA	0.034334	AA	0.816311	13.081978AFFX-1304348	AB	0.002453	AB	0.105021	12.482508AFFX-1852733	AB	0.011381	AB	-0.273979	12.685043AFFX-2126602	BB	0.036226	BB	-0.875437	13.047536AFFX-2899757	AA	0.002617	AA	0.833415	12.116153!sample_table_end
