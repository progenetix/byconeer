The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751557/suppl/GSM751557_TLL_ALL_1238_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751557/suppl/GSM751557_TLL_ALL_1238_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.024975	AB	0.015582	10.794849AFFX-656757	AA	0.008996	AA	0.796096	12.894135AFFX-721431	AA	0.005287	AA	0.879798	12.785041AFFX-737848	BB	0.089880	BB	-0.808730	11.283543AFFX-1329481	BB	0.025986	BB	-0.804733	13.614340AFFX-1375402	AB	0.051517	AB	-0.424726	11.650847AFFX-1987483	AA	0.113641	AA	0.622453	12.495984AFFX-2208108	BB	0.010568	BB	-0.812903	11.623709AFFX-2343975	BB	0.001382	BB	-0.845496	12.132441AFFX-2436931	BB	0.000469	BB	-0.784840	12.117710AFFX-2557092	BB	0.006267	BB	-0.830146	12.223695AFFX-2629782	BB	0.027991	BB	-0.741701	11.388922AFFX-335883	BB	0.008471	BB	-0.717720	11.768391AFFX-2147527	AA	0.007569	AA	0.793571	12.199896AFFX-532031	AB	0.018982	AB	-0.018869	14.091476AFFX-811529	BB	0.025228	BB	-0.765597	13.946783AFFX-1304348	AA	0.085160	AA	0.641934	11.778129AFFX-1852733	BB	0.016465	BB	-0.705695	12.338945AFFX-2126602	AB	0.009856	AB	-0.207072	12.330325AFFX-2899757	AB	0.011457	AB	-0.086134	12.167847!sample_table_end
