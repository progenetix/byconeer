The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751569/suppl/GSM751569_TLL_ALL_9AM_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751569/suppl/GSM751569_TLL_ALL_9AM_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.201498	AB	0.061874	10.030572AFFX-656757	AB	0.225336	AB	-0.512794	12.445555AFFX-721431	AB	0.082721	AB	0.223054	11.461364AFFX-737848	AB	0.003596	AB	0.056372	11.829278AFFX-1329481	AA	0.072840	AA	0.746877	13.448600AFFX-1375402	AA	0.051317	AA	0.549298	10.513435AFFX-1987483	AA	0.028360	AA	0.812574	12.713741AFFX-2208108	BB	0.110934	BB	-0.681373	10.584456AFFX-2343975	AA	0.038523	AA	0.937688	12.584292AFFX-2436931	AB	0.031610	AB	0.235052	13.167234AFFX-2557092	BB	0.003651	BB	-0.858458	12.684382AFFX-2629782	AB	0.060754	AB	-0.178073	10.936831AFFX-335883	AB	0.081468	AB	0.127955	11.086913AFFX-2147527	AA	0.153502	AA	0.715184	11.640469AFFX-532031	AB	0.001436	AB	0.132992	13.616905AFFX-811529	AB	0.020530	AB	-0.138741	13.046101AFFX-1304348	AA	0.444102	AA	0.509738	10.957298AFFX-1852733	AB	0.060111	AB	-0.292751	12.121884AFFX-2126602	BB	0.020421	BB	-0.828904	12.499102AFFX-2899757	BB	0.012563	BB	-0.820169	12.473630!sample_table_end
