The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751570/suppl/GSM751570_TLL_ALL_10SA_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751570/suppl/GSM751570_TLL_ALL_10SA_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.117175	AB	0.029710	10.316617AFFX-656757	AB	0.000796	AB	-0.246710	12.832555AFFX-721431	AA	0.148678	AA	0.780454	11.945083AFFX-737848	AB	0.013951	AB	-0.068795	12.062453AFFX-1329481	AB	0.003967	AB	-0.139211	13.103529AFFX-1375402	AA	0.047738	AA	0.706343	10.741014AFFX-1987483	AA	0.021544	AA	0.804314	12.722945AFFX-2208108	BB	0.077938	BB	-0.709857	10.729175AFFX-2343975	AB	0.022722	AB	0.140309	12.794732AFFX-2436931	BB	0.060284	BB	-0.871502	12.941753AFFX-2557092	AA	0.011502	AA	0.938066	13.067428AFFX-2629782	BB	0.464514	BB	-0.556159	11.017944AFFX-335883	BB	0.065876	BB	-0.610995	11.297359AFFX-2147527	AB	0.125334	AB	-0.071621	11.364739AFFX-532031	AB	0.006834	AB	0.097195	13.870990AFFX-811529	AB	0.008005	AB	-0.111469	13.214768AFFX-1304348	AA	0.344558	AA	0.547598	11.214351AFFX-1852733	BB	0.045339	BB	-0.689058	12.189785AFFX-2126602	BB	0.041675	BB	-0.885571	12.639401AFFX-2899757	AB	0.015542	AB	0.123635	12.854806!sample_table_end
