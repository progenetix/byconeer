The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751556/suppl/GSM751556_TLL_ALL_1015_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751556/suppl/GSM751556_TLL_ALL_1015_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	BB	0.133721	BB	-0.736951	11.753670AFFX-656757	AA	0.000203	AA	0.837778	12.882346AFFX-721431	AB	0.021273	AB	0.386111	12.274423AFFX-737848	AB	0.017474	AB	0.163065	11.490198AFFX-1329481	AB	0.004436	AB	-0.098765	12.939919AFFX-1375402	AB	0.037753	AB	0.027386	11.650582AFFX-1987483	AB	0.002526	AB	0.047184	12.659917AFFX-2208108	AB	0.009526	AB	0.002787	11.154221AFFX-2343975	AB	0.039171	AB	-0.286774	12.144635AFFX-2436931	BB	0.013774	BB	-0.854119	12.176959AFFX-2557092	AB	0.030253	AB	0.451101	13.500869AFFX-2629782	AB	0.302505	AB	-0.436714	11.264873AFFX-335883	BB	0.006903	BB	-0.781203	12.184161AFFX-2147527	AA	0.059502	AA	0.900388	12.926576AFFX-532031	AA	0.068578	AA	0.853791	12.808501AFFX-811529	AA	0.002330	AA	0.875855	13.560141AFFX-1304348	AB	0.019558	AB	-0.017684	12.737799AFFX-1852733	AA	0.040212	AA	0.682527	12.186358AFFX-2126602	BB	0.188019	BB	-0.808980	12.090450AFFX-2899757	BB	0.063809	BB	-0.863630	12.059997!sample_table_end
