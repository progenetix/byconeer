The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751622/suppl/GSM751622_TLL_ALL_6TA_REM_Xba.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751622/suppl/GSM751622_TLL_ALL_6TA_REM_Xba.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.001665	AB	0.024478	11.946158AFFX-656757	AA	0.001548	AA	0.900917	13.472263AFFX-721431	BB	0.013430	BB	-0.883585	11.910779AFFX-737848	AA	0.009078	AA	0.850045	11.881194AFFX-1329481	AB	0.001496	AB	0.003883	13.581687AFFX-1375402	BB	0.010713	BB	-0.867304	12.378256AFFX-1987483	AB	0.001612	AB	0.175730	13.440458AFFX-2208108	BB	0.005784	BB	-0.926472	12.210131AFFX-2343975	AB	0.001716	AB	-0.092832	12.314929AFFX-2436931	AB	0.011846	AB	0.358000	12.598382AFFX-2557092	AA	0.005227	AA	0.944177	13.946424AFFX-2629782	AA	0.005378	AA	0.870182	12.229647AFFX-335883	AB	0.000609	AB	0.265700	13.349216AFFX-2147527	AA	0.002668	AA	0.867703	12.651033AFFX-532031	AB	0.000106	AB	0.041652	13.944696AFFX-811529	AA	0.021002	AA	0.871659	13.832249AFFX-1304348	AA	0.003354	AA	0.890677	13.361232AFFX-1852733	AB	0.001929	AB	-0.265253	13.339909AFFX-2126602	BB	0.007641	BB	-0.937331	13.804650AFFX-2899757	AB	0.002446	AB	-0.042615	12.793559!sample_table_end
