The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751566/suppl/GSM751566_TLL_ALL_3MMp2_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751566/suppl/GSM751566_TLL_ALL_3MMp2_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.021291	AB	0.130360	10.935213AFFX-656757	AB	0.005276	AB	-0.285849	12.735054AFFX-721431	AB	0.002727	AB	0.302338	12.297227AFFX-737848	AB	0.014436	AB	0.107426	12.025663AFFX-1329481	AB	0.003970	AB	-0.068025	12.913502AFFX-1375402	BB	0.023243	BB	-0.881569	12.013434AFFX-1987483	AA	0.035200	AA	0.832630	12.849936AFFX-2208108	BB	0.016260	BB	-0.793898	11.267910AFFX-2343975	BB	0.014874	BB	-0.837390	11.842652AFFX-2436931	AB	0.016246	AB	0.393785	12.185275AFFX-2557092	AA	0.002645	AA	0.923713	13.056164AFFX-2629782	AB	0.037424	AB	-0.176693	11.063892AFFX-335883	BB	0.018856	BB	-0.796782	11.979419AFFX-2147527	AA	0.006638	AA	0.838402	12.449147AFFX-532031	AB	0.002262	AB	0.092583	13.698431AFFX-811529	AA	0.095657	AA	0.902241	14.276405AFFX-1304348	AB	0.022691	AB	0.250898	11.983837AFFX-1852733	BB	0.005458	BB	-0.765317	12.676194AFFX-2126602	AB	0.001229	AB	-0.292554	12.479214AFFX-2899757	AB	0.002192	AB	0.017929	12.522162!sample_table_end
