The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751599/suppl/GSM751599_TLL_ALL_2422p2_Xba.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751599/suppl/GSM751599_TLL_ALL_2422p2_Xba.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.007408	AB	0.074385	11.756878AFFX-656757	AA	0.008281	AA	0.851509	13.191053AFFX-721431	AB	0.045114	AB	0.405436	11.959953AFFX-737848	AB	0.004443	AB	0.049268	11.973515AFFX-1329481	AB	0.001223	AB	-0.034443	13.617023AFFX-1375402	AA	0.017836	AA	0.850170	11.838795AFFX-1987483	BB	0.080018	BB	-0.691232	13.294996AFFX-2208108	AB	0.016157	AB	0.176721	11.997632AFFX-2343975	AB	0.015087	AB	-0.000762	11.834955AFFX-2436931	AB	0.070299	AB	0.530617	12.411126AFFX-2557092	AB	0.000723	AB	0.324158	13.418489AFFX-2629782	AB	0.040861	AB	-0.442114	11.912439AFFX-335883	AA	0.025380	AA	0.885826	13.154045AFFX-2147527	AA	0.002095	AA	0.878636	12.936930AFFX-532031	AB	0.001098	AB	0.079658	13.923064AFFX-811529	AB	0.002718	AB	0.008164	14.077354AFFX-1304348	AA	0.019917	AA	0.875214	12.936369AFFX-1852733	AB	0.000782	AB	-0.242419	13.028010AFFX-2126602	BB	0.001569	BB	-0.906298	13.632133AFFX-2899757	AB	0.011602	AB	0.208837	12.501427!sample_table_end
