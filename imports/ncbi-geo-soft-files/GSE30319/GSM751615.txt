The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751615/suppl/GSM751615_TLL_ALL_1870_REM_Xba.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751615/suppl/GSM751615_TLL_ALL_1870_REM_Xba.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.002525	AB	-0.019532	12.444793AFFX-656757	AA	0.020676	AA	0.893775	13.875285AFFX-721431	AA	0.023827	AA	0.930228	13.187609AFFX-737848	AB	0.000576	AB	-0.057671	12.309016AFFX-1329481	AB	0.004421	AB	-0.122409	13.901453AFFX-1375402	AB	0.003127	AB	-0.213090	12.599861AFFX-1987483	AB	0.000631	AB	0.149397	13.366450AFFX-2208108	AB	0.001362	AB	0.005291	12.404172AFFX-2343975	AA	0.041945	AA	0.897276	12.642811AFFX-2436931	BB	0.000965	BB	-0.839684	12.467475AFFX-2557092	AA	0.021241	AA	0.959507	14.113638AFFX-2629782	AB	0.007580	AB	-0.363153	12.542905AFFX-335883	AA	0.009498	AA	0.933270	13.690393AFFX-2147527	AA	0.001514	AA	0.888668	12.938981AFFX-532031	AA	0.000308	AA	0.854120	13.839510AFFX-811529	BB	0.037541	BB	-0.894245	14.984329AFFX-1304348	AB	0.001414	AB	0.141580	13.691621AFFX-1852733	AB	0.012459	AB	-0.325329	13.584785AFFX-2126602	AB	0.002940	AB	-0.405306	13.633830AFFX-2899757	BB	0.015237	BB	-0.890089	12.959396!sample_table_end
