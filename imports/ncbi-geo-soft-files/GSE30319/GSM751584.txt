The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751584/suppl/GSM751584_TLL_ALL_3MM_REM_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751584/suppl/GSM751584_TLL_ALL_3MM_REM_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.019935	AB	-0.047895	11.774360AFFX-656757	AB	0.013711	AB	-0.308876	13.266491AFFX-721431	AB	0.007436	AB	0.177745	12.711204AFFX-737848	AB	0.021982	AB	0.179028	11.493611AFFX-1329481	AB	0.005751	AB	0.041770	12.973132AFFX-1375402	BB	0.009243	BB	-0.874085	12.205288AFFX-1987483	AA	0.007067	AA	0.711653	12.515106AFFX-2208108	BB	0.016607	BB	-0.792712	11.688842AFFX-2343975	BB	0.013762	BB	-0.875780	12.330449AFFX-2436931	AB	0.003478	AB	0.252831	12.330398AFFX-2557092	AA	0.031168	AA	0.911353	13.268782AFFX-2629782	AB	0.010180	AB	-0.125837	11.904222AFFX-335883	BB	0.005330	BB	-0.774810	12.122731AFFX-2147527	AA	0.030723	AA	0.765321	12.392354AFFX-532031	AB	0.002790	AB	0.171522	13.565940AFFX-811529	AA	0.015948	AA	0.844436	13.246906AFFX-1304348	AB	0.006851	AB	0.038993	12.328645AFFX-1852733	BB	0.056821	BB	-0.850996	12.886374AFFX-2126602	AB	0.003508	AB	-0.368913	12.611391AFFX-2899757	AB	0.001349	AB	0.062821	12.184835!sample_table_end
