The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751593/suppl/GSM751593_TLL_ALL_1238_Xba.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751593/suppl/GSM751593_TLL_ALL_1238_Xba.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.000680	AB	0.000064	12.282468AFFX-656757	AA	0.000856	AA	0.882230	13.513429AFFX-721431	AA	0.022840	AA	0.919635	12.715492AFFX-737848	BB	0.003436	BB	-0.850295	12.234585AFFX-1329481	BB	0.005845	BB	-0.861286	13.941731AFFX-1375402	AB	0.014306	AB	-0.364738	12.172695AFFX-1987483	AA	0.010514	AA	0.817126	13.557093AFFX-2208108	BB	0.000103	BB	-0.907338	12.255726AFFX-2343975	BB	0.002553	BB	-0.887702	12.378907AFFX-2436931	BB	0.001249	BB	-0.830655	12.260702AFFX-2557092	BB	0.002012	BB	-0.914009	13.376146AFFX-2629782	BB	0.026066	BB	-0.916776	12.554500AFFX-335883	BB	0.001055	BB	-0.897025	13.083417AFFX-2147527	AA	0.000107	AA	0.874915	12.785857AFFX-532031	AB	0.001167	AB	-0.014869	14.056758AFFX-811529	BB	0.002962	BB	-0.851580	14.493690AFFX-1304348	AA	0.001263	AA	0.871373	13.214249AFFX-1852733	BB	0.007311	BB	-0.859152	13.298722AFFX-2126602	AB	0.000105	AB	-0.406640	13.432176AFFX-2899757	AB	0.012071	AB	-0.140886	12.897502!sample_table_end
