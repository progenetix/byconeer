The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751586/suppl/GSM751586_TLL_ALL_6TA_REM_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751586/suppl/GSM751586_TLL_ALL_6TA_REM_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.002234	AB	-0.017232	11.397438AFFX-656757	AA	0.021732	AA	0.856571	13.264524AFFX-721431	BB	0.006266	BB	-0.866756	12.472902AFFX-737848	AA	0.007510	AA	0.692709	11.395720AFFX-1329481	AB	0.001636	AB	-0.096973	13.062214AFFX-1375402	BB	0.015901	BB	-0.885885	12.110447AFFX-1987483	AB	0.013635	AB	-0.035038	12.730093AFFX-2208108	BB	0.019875	BB	-0.830776	11.518377AFFX-2343975	AB	0.000599	AB	-0.009107	12.211995AFFX-2436931	AB	0.030196	AB	0.446057	12.528896AFFX-2557092	AA	0.024415	AA	0.938433	13.323741AFFX-2629782	AA	0.030857	AA	0.828002	11.749802AFFX-335883	AB	0.011012	AB	0.228104	12.417675AFFX-2147527	AA	0.009489	AA	0.840333	12.407817AFFX-532031	AB	0.005885	AB	0.203347	13.557089AFFX-811529	AA	0.005066	AA	0.887738	13.610734AFFX-1304348	AA	0.008534	AA	0.763610	12.356179AFFX-1852733	AB	0.006612	AB	-0.062942	12.771732AFFX-2126602	BB	0.011307	BB	-0.862374	12.891113AFFX-2899757	AB	0.010570	AB	-0.080310	12.162720!sample_table_end
