The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751604/suppl/GSM751604_TLL_ALL_6TA_Xba.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751604/suppl/GSM751604_TLL_ALL_6TA_Xba.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.002064	AB	-0.015498	11.925669AFFX-656757	AA	0.011071	AA	0.859967	13.110329AFFX-721431	BB	0.011854	BB	-0.775039	11.891759AFFX-737848	AA	0.021507	AA	0.845753	11.759378AFFX-1329481	AB	0.006042	AB	-0.071121	13.400082AFFX-1375402	BB	0.009753	BB	-0.882394	12.307680AFFX-1987483	AB	0.022624	AB	0.217560	12.983659AFFX-2208108	BB	0.009108	BB	-0.904515	12.075184AFFX-2343975	AB	0.005154	AB	0.058381	12.142466AFFX-2436931	AB	0.017984	AB	0.436842	12.534014AFFX-2557092	AA	0.001587	AA	0.941905	13.749642AFFX-2629782	AA	0.013007	AA	0.812677	11.692340AFFX-335883	AB	0.018658	AB	0.324049	12.784326AFFX-2147527	AA	0.000960	AA	0.875549	12.721943AFFX-532031	AB	0.000560	AB	0.008985	13.796749AFFX-811529	AA	0.016420	AA	0.862022	13.863609AFFX-1304348	AA	0.026684	AA	0.881072	12.900743AFFX-1852733	AB	0.017297	AB	-0.227708	12.595255AFFX-2126602	BB	0.025524	BB	-0.897103	13.353720AFFX-2899757	AB	0.004092	AB	0.168026	12.690907!sample_table_end
