The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751581/suppl/GSM751581_TLL_ALL_2422_REM_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751581/suppl/GSM751581_TLL_ALL_2422_REM_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.092952	AB	0.114504	10.426445AFFX-656757	AA	0.083165	AA	0.834595	12.131962AFFX-721431	AB	0.038653	AB	0.174345	11.710404AFFX-737848	AB	0.211787	AB	0.130330	10.367846AFFX-1329481	AB	0.041409	AB	-0.209004	12.688492AFFX-1375402	AA	0.101026	AA	0.481732	10.376754AFFX-1987483	BB	0.064740	BB	-0.742798	12.543252AFFX-2208108	AB	0.149379	AB	-0.214923	10.539681AFFX-2343975	AB	0.075006	AB	0.187174	11.216519AFFX-2436931	AB	0.080758	AB	0.325681	11.662015AFFX-2557092	AB	0.382892	AB	0.671398	12.331806AFFX-2629782	NC	0.662430	AB	-0.464033	10.998586AFFX-335883	AA	0.076973	AA	0.733088	11.709371AFFX-2147527	AA	0.183406	AA	0.815938	11.744532AFFX-532031	AB	0.029013	AB	0.196432	12.905423AFFX-811529	AB	0.054068	AB	-0.304006	13.443938AFFX-1304348	AA	0.070342	AA	0.660039	12.044501AFFX-1852733	NC	0.571865	AB	-0.489047	12.223106AFFX-2126602	BB	0.277629	BB	-0.768187	11.928030AFFX-2899757	NC	0.933346	BB	-0.346265	10.838965!sample_table_end
