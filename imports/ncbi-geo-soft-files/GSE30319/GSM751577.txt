The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751577/suppl/GSM751577_TLL_ALL_1520_REM_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751577/suppl/GSM751577_TLL_ALL_1520_REM_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.137161	AB	-0.128516	10.555557AFFX-656757	AB	0.002777	AB	-0.241228	12.739437AFFX-721431	AA	0.008047	AA	0.885183	12.826536AFFX-737848	AB	0.005073	AB	0.048454	11.367545AFFX-1329481	BB	0.004167	BB	-0.776789	13.336420AFFX-1375402	AB	0.010950	AB	-0.282515	11.533354AFFX-1987483	NC	0.694990	BB	-0.348744	12.947023AFFX-2208108	AB	0.028833	AB	-0.171365	11.120765AFFX-2343975	AB	0.001412	AB	-0.026948	11.853696AFFX-2436931	BB	0.008805	BB	-0.809678	11.919044AFFX-2557092	AA	0.014749	AA	0.891514	12.924115AFFX-2629782	AA	0.038538	AA	0.601032	10.957737AFFX-335883	AB	0.002824	AB	0.072407	12.123845AFFX-2147527	BB	0.006829	BB	-0.728953	12.422469AFFX-532031	AB	0.001068	AB	0.133115	13.589029AFFX-811529	AA	0.001223	AA	0.842560	13.520367AFFX-1304348	AA	0.048530	AA	0.717826	12.363644AFFX-1852733	AA	0.102147	AA	0.565106	12.598887AFFX-2126602	AB	0.003999	AB	-0.299471	12.285785AFFX-2899757	BB	0.011467	BB	-0.712695	12.096834!sample_table_end
