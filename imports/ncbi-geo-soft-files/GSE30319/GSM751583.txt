The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751583/suppl/GSM751583_TLL_ALL_2NP_REM_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751583/suppl/GSM751583_TLL_ALL_2NP_REM_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.021140	AB	0.176844	11.628020AFFX-656757	AA	0.032571	AA	0.859935	13.358049AFFX-721431	AB	0.019786	AB	0.378257	12.678504AFFX-737848	AB	0.015103	AB	-0.140368	11.465894AFFX-1329481	BB	0.025486	BB	-0.798414	13.039330AFFX-1375402	AB	0.006568	AB	-0.144911	12.057464AFFX-1987483	AA	0.034120	AA	0.813948	12.668545AFFX-2208108	AB	0.005858	AB	0.076988	11.738843AFFX-2343975	AA	0.003713	AA	0.880043	12.203453AFFX-2436931	BB	0.001566	BB	-0.801138	12.082322AFFX-2557092	AA	0.003764	AA	0.933292	13.147754AFFX-2629782	BB	0.057546	BB	-0.852293	12.140055AFFX-335883	AA	0.050534	AA	0.857750	12.190001AFFX-2147527	AA	0.005815	AA	0.836573	12.449900AFFX-532031	AA	0.028359	AA	0.903658	13.876524AFFX-811529	AA	0.023831	AA	0.825617	13.157123AFFX-1304348	AA	0.050759	AA	0.819937	12.316965AFFX-1852733	AA	0.021507	AA	0.743443	12.902115AFFX-2126602	BB	0.047138	BB	-0.898579	13.122673AFFX-2899757	AB	0.004563	AB	-0.051844	12.314430!sample_table_end
