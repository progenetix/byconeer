The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751576/suppl/GSM751576_TLL_ALL_1433_REM_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751576/suppl/GSM751576_TLL_ALL_1433_REM_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.028308	AB	0.073098	10.745023AFFX-656757	AB	0.004001	AB	-0.136450	12.834463AFFX-721431	BB	0.016123	BB	-0.869495	12.113482AFFX-737848	AB	0.020648	AB	0.183833	11.611746AFFX-1329481	BB	0.004222	BB	-0.803205	13.230963AFFX-1375402	BB	0.034818	BB	-0.846950	11.816442AFFX-1987483	NC	0.680048	BB	-0.339794	12.762530AFFX-2208108	BB	0.045731	BB	-0.714784	10.882915AFFX-2343975	AB	0.036738	AB	-0.259639	11.749747AFFX-2436931	BB	0.033559	BB	-0.824521	11.694540AFFX-2557092	AA	0.027006	AA	0.925845	12.931484AFFX-2629782	AB	0.104790	AB	-0.357326	11.245217AFFX-335883	AB	0.007901	AB	0.209908	12.395349AFFX-2147527	AA	0.005762	AA	0.779301	12.252484AFFX-532031	AB	0.000545	AB	0.131001	13.407034AFFX-811529	BB	0.001745	BB	-0.794858	13.779071AFFX-1304348	AA	0.027809	AA	0.711361	12.265466AFFX-1852733	AA	0.019556	AA	0.619973	12.178260AFFX-2126602	AA	0.010725	AA	0.811533	12.019355AFFX-2899757	BB	0.004900	BB	-0.773378	12.077796!sample_table_end
