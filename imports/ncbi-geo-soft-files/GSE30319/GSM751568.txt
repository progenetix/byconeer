The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751568/suppl/GSM751568_TLL_ALL_6TA_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751568/suppl/GSM751568_TLL_ALL_6TA_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.022080	AB	-0.092257	11.022139AFFX-656757	AA	0.003971	AA	0.827592	12.982411AFFX-721431	BB	0.004872	BB	-0.769016	12.109147AFFX-737848	AA	0.015296	AA	0.755384	11.804213AFFX-1329481	AB	0.004060	AB	0.047210	13.156423AFFX-1375402	BB	0.003603	BB	-0.856238	12.026399AFFX-1987483	AB	0.002949	AB	0.088056	12.745863AFFX-2208108	BB	0.004783	BB	-0.792528	11.557616AFFX-2343975	AB	0.002443	AB	-0.052045	11.800521AFFX-2436931	AB	0.066681	AB	0.484936	12.270984AFFX-2557092	AA	0.039907	AA	0.927311	13.357123AFFX-2629782	AA	0.003102	AA	0.729670	11.571714AFFX-335883	AB	0.009209	AB	0.232026	12.346094AFFX-2147527	AA	0.008569	AA	0.821721	12.542602AFFX-532031	AB	0.001374	AB	0.100486	13.647617AFFX-811529	AA	0.002003	AA	0.861410	13.618881AFFX-1304348	AA	0.026078	AA	0.721462	12.310172AFFX-1852733	AB	0.001515	AB	-0.189043	12.476454AFFX-2126602	BB	0.039700	BB	-0.846033	12.970843AFFX-2899757	AB	0.002764	AB	0.002092	12.522818!sample_table_end
