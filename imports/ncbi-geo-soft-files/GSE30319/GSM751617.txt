The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751617/suppl/GSM751617_TLL_ALL_2422_REM_Xba.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751617/suppl/GSM751617_TLL_ALL_2422_REM_Xba.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.006204	AB	0.056951	11.764080AFFX-656757	AA	0.097035	AA	0.850934	12.453086AFFX-721431	AB	0.039521	AB	0.259406	11.844127AFFX-737848	AB	0.091653	AB	-0.213398	11.111497AFFX-1329481	AB	0.019078	AB	0.014784	12.971241AFFX-1375402	AA	0.256511	AA	0.612182	12.165133AFFX-1987483	BB	0.046686	BB	-0.791673	12.620420AFFX-2208108	AB	0.006473	AB	-0.037264	11.658846AFFX-2343975	BB	0.367575	BB	-0.812107	12.811917AFFX-2436931	AB	0.027638	AB	0.303471	12.445959AFFX-2557092	AB	0.032556	AB	0.291808	12.591247AFFX-2629782	AB	0.020803	AB	-0.196731	11.781660AFFX-335883	AA	0.075358	AA	0.951830	14.110615AFFX-2147527	AA	0.063981	AA	0.845949	11.986525AFFX-532031	AB	0.086473	AB	0.192255	12.848629AFFX-811529	AB	0.020449	AB	-0.185058	13.668605AFFX-1304348	AA	0.053302	AA	0.883663	12.762870AFFX-1852733	AB	0.066189	AB	-0.255943	12.182521AFFX-2126602	BB	0.313321	BB	-0.863844	12.651886AFFX-2899757	AB	0.046722	AB	0.140668	11.724195!sample_table_end
