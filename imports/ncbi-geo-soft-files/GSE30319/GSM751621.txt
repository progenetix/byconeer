The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751621/suppl/GSM751621_TLL_ALL_5NL_REM_Xba.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751621/suppl/GSM751621_TLL_ALL_5NL_REM_Xba.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 58991#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.005819	AB	0.171609	12.281466AFFX-656757	AA	0.000157	AA	0.887828	13.475542AFFX-721431	AB	0.000963	AB	0.318197	12.548658AFFX-737848	BB	0.003870	BB	-0.879619	12.189054AFFX-1329481	AA	0.006113	AA	0.902797	13.763057AFFX-1375402	BB	0.015832	BB	-0.919459	12.691469AFFX-1987483	AB	0.003526	AB	0.018981	13.442032AFFX-2208108	AB	0.001066	AB	0.058415	12.217376AFFX-2343975	AB	0.000035	AB	-0.056713	12.471895AFFX-2436931	AB	0.004484	AB	0.372848	13.071239AFFX-2557092	BB	0.001131	BB	-0.910168	13.336593AFFX-2629782	BB	0.002473	BB	-0.892618	12.613310AFFX-335883	BB	0.004527	BB	-0.921025	13.455173AFFX-2147527	AB	0.005105	AB	-0.151072	12.923969AFFX-532031	AB	0.000844	AB	-0.021345	13.960503AFFX-811529	AA	0.014555	AA	0.899915	13.965917AFFX-1304348	AB	0.000865	AB	0.095514	13.326077AFFX-1852733	AB	0.002448	AB	-0.218327	13.337763AFFX-2126602	BB	0.032298	BB	-0.941037	14.046370AFFX-2899757	AA	0.001910	AA	0.899111	12.758494!sample_table_end
