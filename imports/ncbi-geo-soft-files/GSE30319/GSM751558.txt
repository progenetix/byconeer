The recommended QC and SNP call rate thresholds were used (BRLMM algorithm). Paired copy number analysis was performed using three different algorithms: PartekGS, CRMA and CNAG. The aberration segments provided by Partek Genomics Suite 6.08 software were generated using the genomic segmentation algorithm at a p-value of 0.001 and a signal to noise ratio of 0.3 and a minimum of ten genomic markers. The segmentation data were then filtered for p-value â¤ 0.01. Copy-number values obtained by Robust Multichip Analysis (CRMAv.2) were generated by normalizing each tumorâs probe set intensity to that of its paired normal reference. Raw copy number was estimated by using the CRMA algorithm (Bengtsson et al., 2008). Copy number segmentation of log2 ratios was performed in R using the DNA copy number package v1.16.0 which applies CBS (Circular Binary Segmentation) (Venkatraman and Olshen, 2007). Genomic copy numbers were also calculated using the CNAG v2.0 software package which relies on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis (Nannya et al., 2005). Copy number values â¤ 1.7 and â¥ 2.3 were considered losses and gains, respectively.[Combined_Hind_Xba_matrix provided as supplementary file on Series records]!Sample_data_processing = primary data description : Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Antonella,,Lettieri!Sample_contact_email = a.lettieri@hsgerardo.org!Sample_contact_institute = Tettamanti Research Center!Sample_contact_address = via Pergolesi 33!Sample_contact_city = Monza!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20900!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751558/suppl/GSM751558_TLL_ALL_1433_Hind.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM751nnn/GSM751558/suppl/GSM751558_TLL_ALL_1433_Hind.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30319!Sample_data_row_count = 57275#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-601964	AB	0.004859	AB	-0.026179	11.117099AFFX-656757	AB	0.002642	AB	-0.195430	13.110416AFFX-721431	BB	0.004757	BB	-0.839494	12.454138AFFX-737848	AB	0.002494	AB	-0.066275	11.665194AFFX-1329481	BB	0.070213	BB	-0.823767	13.870425AFFX-1375402	BB	0.025116	BB	-0.799232	12.009893AFFX-1987483	BB	0.039548	BB	-0.546837	12.940248AFFX-2208108	BB	0.026526	BB	-0.767880	11.668361AFFX-2343975	AB	0.003647	AB	-0.115713	12.221736AFFX-2436931	BB	0.056857	BB	-0.642271	11.809901AFFX-2557092	AA	0.065002	AA	0.919758	13.402673AFFX-2629782	AB	0.006707	AB	-0.259390	11.568702AFFX-335883	AB	0.000446	AB	0.173351	12.115013AFFX-2147527	AA	0.003917	AA	0.805851	12.266730AFFX-532031	AB	0.005130	AB	-0.006339	13.451439AFFX-811529	BB	0.033957	BB	-0.788511	14.082204AFFX-1304348	AA	0.033883	AA	0.699402	12.218680AFFX-1852733	AA	0.007145	AA	0.626685	12.464897AFFX-2126602	AA	0.001327	AA	0.754030	12.167586AFFX-2899757	BB	0.011948	BB	-0.728856	12.245229!sample_table_end
