Inferred copy number states of each SNP were extracted and converted from .CEL files into signal intensities using GCOS and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT) v4.0.1. We utilized the HMM-based algorithm with defaults for tuning parameters, Gaussian smoothing, transition decay, and median scaling.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The .CHP files contain the normalized, summarized signal intensities generated by the primary analysis software (CNAT). The 'GSE21057_tumor_copy_number.txt' file, which is linked to the Series GSE21057 record as a supplementary file, contains the (blood-adjusted) tumor copy number calls used in our final analyses.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Brock,Clarke,Christensen!Sample_contact_email = brock.clarke.christensen@dartmouth.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Dartmouth Medical School!Sample_contact_address = 7650 Remsen!Sample_contact_city = Hanover!Sample_contact_state = NH!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 03755!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM526nnn/GSM526410/suppl/GSM526410.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM526nnn/GSM526410/suppl/GSM526410.CHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21057!Sample_series_id = GSE21058!Sample_data_row_count = 238378#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotypes: AA, AB, BB, No Call#CONFIDENCE = #RAS1 = Relative allele signal for the data in the first probe group#RAS2 = Relative allele signal for the data in the second probe group#P-VALUE AA = #P-VALUE AB = #P-VALUE BB = #P-VALUE NO CALL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	RAS1	RAS2	P-VALUE AA	P-VALUE AB	P-VALUE BB	P-VALUE NO CALLAFFX-5Q-123	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-456	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-789	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-ABC	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeA	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeB	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeC	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeD	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeE	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeF	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeG	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeH	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeI	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeJ	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeK	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeL	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeM	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeN	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeO	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeP	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0!sample_table_end
