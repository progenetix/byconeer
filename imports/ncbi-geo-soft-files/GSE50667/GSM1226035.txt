For copy number, CEL files were analysed using the arome.affymetrix R package. All probes from each allele were combined in one value per probeset (SNP or CN). Segmentation was done using the Rseg R package.!Sample_data_processing = The log2 ratio was calculated as the log2 ratio between the theta estimates from the tumor sample and the theta estimates from the blood sample from the same patient for chromosomes 1 to 22 and chromosome X.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Philippe,,Lamy!Sample_contact_email = PHILIPPE.LAMY@SVF.AU.DK!Sample_contact_department = Department of molecular medecine!Sample_contact_institute = MOMA!Sample_contact_address = BrendstrupgÃ¥rdsvej 100!Sample_contact_city = Aarhus N!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8200!Sample_contact_country = Denmark!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1226nnn/GSM1226035/suppl/GSM1226035_A532-036.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1226nnn/GSM1226035/suppl/GSM1226035_A532-036.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE50667!Sample_series_id = GSE50668!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.012536	BB	543.554199	2851.284424SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.002078	BB	328.112213	802.265503SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001392	BB	1181.110596	4072.144287SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.001379	BB	785.749878	2695.906982SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.001878	AA	1386.948853	403.951416SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.002186	AA	2045.913940	364.535858SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.005284	BB	348.660034	1558.414795SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.001490	AA	2811.271484	797.249023SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.001659	AA	1674.271851	465.099670SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.006667	AA	1478.903809	407.879608SNP_A-1995893	AA	0.003246	AA	2068.678223	788.125427SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.001971	BB	626.645630	3485.834717SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.010095	AA	2123.246582	282.368011SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.003422	AA	2161.134521	531.489868SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.001900	AA	1245.163086	315.159607SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.001144	AA	3668.815430	1382.568115SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.003723	AB	2844.363525	2860.679688SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.003528	AA	1970.718018	311.552094SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.002356	AA	4188.476074	980.971619SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.004858	AA	2485.097900	403.951416!sample_table_end
