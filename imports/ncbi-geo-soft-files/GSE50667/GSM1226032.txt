For copy number, CEL files were analysed using the arome.affymetrix R package. All probes from each allele were combined in one value per probeset (SNP or CN). Segmentation was done using the Rseg R package.!Sample_data_processing = The log2 ratio was calculated as the log2 ratio between the theta estimates from the tumor sample and the theta estimates from the blood sample from the same patient for chromosomes 1 to 22 and chromosome X.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Philippe,,Lamy!Sample_contact_email = PHILIPPE.LAMY@SVF.AU.DK!Sample_contact_department = Department of molecular medecine!Sample_contact_institute = MOMA!Sample_contact_address = BrendstrupgÃ¥rdsvej 100!Sample_contact_city = Aarhus N!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8200!Sample_contact_country = Denmark!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1226nnn/GSM1226032/suppl/GSM1226032_A532-030.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1226nnn/GSM1226032/suppl/GSM1226032_A532-030.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE50667!Sample_series_id = GSE50668!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.004191	BB	723.667480	2714.465088SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.000616	AB	646.549194	636.398315SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.005254	BB	1330.750488	3947.787842SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.003733	AB	2170.796875	1726.072144SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.001754	AA	1242.715332	399.581085SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.007555	AB	1566.007446	919.187012SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.005081	BB	389.436676	1551.822510SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.000322	AA	2883.186035	766.910645SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.007334	AA	1851.992920	404.701630SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.002281	BB	582.880920	1258.013550SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.001285	BB	505.321014	2264.444092SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.000253	BB	695.152771	3512.579834SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.002886	AA	1424.901978	301.630188SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.005711	AA	2181.476318	483.580139SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.004891	BB	570.303833	1407.424438SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.002097	AA	3361.531738	1318.675537SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.002570	AA	3491.929443	817.183411SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.001182	AA	1818.211548	353.386871SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.007881	AA	4016.638916	825.010437SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.007640	AA	2282.574707	312.102203!sample_table_end
