For copy number, CEL files were analysed using the arome.affymetrix R package. All probes from each allele were combined in one value per probeset (SNP or CN). Segmentation was done using the Rseg R package.!Sample_data_processing = The log2 ratio was calculated as the log2 ratio between the theta estimates from the tumor sample and the theta estimates from the blood sample from the same patient for chromosomes 1 to 22 and chromosome X.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Philippe,,Lamy!Sample_contact_email = PHILIPPE.LAMY@SVF.AU.DK!Sample_contact_department = Department of molecular medecine!Sample_contact_institute = MOMA!Sample_contact_address = BrendstrupgÃ¥rdsvej 100!Sample_contact_city = Aarhus N!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8200!Sample_contact_country = Denmark!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1226nnn/GSM1226034/suppl/GSM1226034_A532-029.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1226nnn/GSM1226034/suppl/GSM1226034_A532-029.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE50667!Sample_series_id = GSE50668!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.004455	BB	658.605957	1904.080566SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.001158	AB	656.285767	656.285767SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.002922	BB	1430.567871	4350.067871SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.012953	AB	2929.865234	2095.669922SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.008689	AA	912.489075	331.142365SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.004906	AB	1213.366333	884.749084SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.013378	BB	282.494904	893.765869SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.011209	AA	2863.331055	956.876526SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.000829	AA	1607.151245	463.731934SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.004385	BB	411.253815	1328.844482SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.010411	BB	631.682617	2600.760986SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.009333	BB	645.479126	4064.017578SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.014397	AA	1411.527588	393.997284SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.011322	AA	1245.804688	581.713440SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.010482	AB	558.351013	757.505432SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.004433	AA	3152.450195	1223.866577SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.006275	AA	4216.971191	841.580017SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.002993	AA	1668.259277	349.662384SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.009699	AA	4584.836426	1403.744141SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.008129	AA	1350.396118	300.677277!sample_table_end
