For copy number, CEL files were analysed using the arome.affymetrix R package. All probes from each allele were combined in one value per probeset (SNP or CN). Segmentation was done using the Rseg R package.!Sample_data_processing = The log2 ratio was calculated as the log2 ratio between the theta estimates from the tumor sample and the theta estimates from the blood sample from the same patient for chromosomes 1 to 22 and chromosome X.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Philippe,,Lamy!Sample_contact_email = PHILIPPE.LAMY@SVF.AU.DK!Sample_contact_department = Department of molecular medecine!Sample_contact_institute = MOMA!Sample_contact_address = BrendstrupgÃ¥rdsvej 100!Sample_contact_city = Aarhus N!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8200!Sample_contact_country = Denmark!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1226nnn/GSM1226033/suppl/GSM1226033_A532-028.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1226nnn/GSM1226033/suppl/GSM1226033_A532-028.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE50667!Sample_series_id = GSE50668!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.002940	BB	486.549622	1904.263672SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.003994	AB	558.443726	670.504089SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004524	BB	1058.229736	4205.795898SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.005377	AB	2024.884277	1491.331909SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.004777	AA	1315.878784	441.666260SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.005416	AB	1591.851440	1045.291016SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.005107	BB	245.840195	1077.228516SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.002122	AA	2693.734375	767.139526SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.003264	AA	1281.026733	387.891846SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.002720	BB	518.911987	1429.649780SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.004105	BB	371.816742	1953.204346SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.002262	BB	615.771362	3343.544434SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.003529	AA	1385.082397	292.111115SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.000963	AA	1981.788086	585.890564SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.001545	BB	515.780701	1240.006592SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.001010	AA	3703.973389	1375.193359SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.000833	AA	3786.944580	876.310120SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.017992	AA	2020.285400	473.551392SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.002269	AA	4350.617188	1006.463501SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.001332	AA	2127.465088	355.761749!sample_table_end
