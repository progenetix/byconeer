For copy number, CEL files were analysed using the arome.affymetrix R package. All probes from each allele were combined in one value per probeset (SNP or CN). Segmentation was done using the Rseg R package.!Sample_data_processing = The log2 ratio was calculated as the log2 ratio between the theta estimates from the tumor sample and the theta estimates from the blood sample from the same patient for chromosomes 1 to 22 and chromosome X.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Philippe,,Lamy!Sample_contact_email = PHILIPPE.LAMY@SVF.AU.DK!Sample_contact_department = Department of molecular medecine!Sample_contact_institute = MOMA!Sample_contact_address = BrendstrupgÃ¥rdsvej 100!Sample_contact_city = Aarhus N!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8200!Sample_contact_country = Denmark!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1226nnn/GSM1226037/suppl/GSM1226037_A532-035.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1226nnn/GSM1226037/suppl/GSM1226037_A532-035.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE50667!Sample_series_id = GSE50668!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.015211	BB	913.270081	3285.591309SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.016463	BB	285.735809	1157.416992SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.008355	BB	1606.844727	4455.188965SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.018554	BB	1014.301514	3575.924561SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.006116	AA	987.024536	384.747711SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.014176	AA	1754.661621	455.871887SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.021720	BB	307.685852	823.494202SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.022755	AA	4076.772461	1164.277588SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.002053	AA	1642.903687	416.410339SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.062209	AA	2038.866089	814.289673SNP_A-1995893	AA	0.001884	AA	2016.079956	979.346497SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.026987	BB	1062.747681	3970.120605SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.026477	AA	2729.705322	449.224640SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.022910	AA	986.381226	614.980164SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.008412	AA	838.254578	329.572998SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.001448	AA	3651.921875	1393.804565SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.028940	AB	3366.208496	2299.806396SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.009112	AA	1909.065918	436.015961SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.015329	AA	4715.550781	1493.238281SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.017129	AA	1011.416199	259.262115!sample_table_end
