PLASQ copy number and segmented copy number are included in Sample table. SNP genotype calls are provided as supplementary text files. Call data in the TXT files corresponding to the raw CEL files were generated using GTYPE ver. 4.0 with the Dynamic Model Mapping Algorithm. The threshold for Allele A, Allele B and Allele AB was 0.33.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Patricia,,Greninger!Sample_contact_email = pgreninger@partners.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Settleman Lab!Sample_contact_department = Center for Molecular Therapeutics!Sample_contact_institute = Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 149 13th St!Sample_contact_city = Charlestown!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02129!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385524/suppl/GSM385524.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385524/suppl/GSM385524.txt.gz!Sample_relation = Reanalyzed by: GSE85838!Sample_series_id = GSE15126!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = PLASQ copy number#SEGM = Segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SEGMSNP_A-1780619	0.3469458	1.419926SNP_A-1780618	1.974039	1.415236SNP_A-1780617	2.241656	2.011344SNP_A-1780778	1.919303	1.997980SNP_A-1780616	2.324430	1.982587SNP_A-1780613	1.186671	1.406417SNP_A-1780419	1.125050	1.419926SNP_A-1780612	1.898529	1.967075SNP_A-1780418	2.02981	1.997980SNP_A-1780611	2.268618	1.415236SNP_A-1780610	1.218035	1.356481SNP_A-1780415	3.658850	1.997980SNP_A-1780576	1.136991	1.419926SNP_A-1780413	2.942317	2.551079SNP_A-1780412	1.168481	1.997980SNP_A-1780574	1.795063	2.007999SNP_A-1780379	2.125493	2.008339SNP_A-1780572	0.6846066	1.412649SNP_A-1780378	1.938513	2.541611SNP_A-1780377	2.914166	2.573359!sample_table_end
