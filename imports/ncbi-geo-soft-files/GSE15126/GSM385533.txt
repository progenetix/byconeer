PLASQ copy number and segmented copy number are included in Sample table. SNP genotype calls are provided as supplementary text files. Call data in the TXT files corresponding to the raw CEL files were generated using GTYPE ver. 4.0 with the Dynamic Model Mapping Algorithm. The threshold for Allele A, Allele B and Allele AB was 0.33.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Patricia,,Greninger!Sample_contact_email = pgreninger@partners.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Settleman Lab!Sample_contact_department = Center for Molecular Therapeutics!Sample_contact_institute = Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 149 13th St!Sample_contact_city = Charlestown!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02129!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385533/suppl/GSM385533.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385533/suppl/GSM385533.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15126!Sample_data_row_count = 238228#ID_REF = #VALUE = PLASQ copy number#SEGM = Segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SEGMSNP_A-1780358	1.990109	2.347926SNP_A-1780551	0.8624534	1.646014SNP_A-1780357	1.983810	2.139914SNP_A-1780550	2.326449	1.64806SNP_A-1780352	1.613563	1.643367SNP_A-1780351	1.258286	1.789141SNP_A-1780350	1.264567	2.333482SNP_A-1780748	2.397143	1.639882SNP_A-1780747	1.353190	1.797546SNP_A-1780746	1.107914	1.797546SNP_A-1780745	1.632352	1.568556SNP_A-1780743	1.669553	0.8880466SNP_A-1780549	1.588040	2.329311SNP_A-1780547	1.884376	2.341692SNP_A-1780541	0.748435	2.139914SNP_A-1780346	2.791765	2.298192SNP_A-1780345	1.441404	1.639882SNP_A-1780342	2.867148	2.437689SNP_A-1780341	1.612677	2.28975SNP_A-1780340	2.184142	2.359037!sample_table_end
