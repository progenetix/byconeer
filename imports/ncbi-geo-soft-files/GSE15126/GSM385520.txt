PLASQ copy number and segmented copy number are included in Sample table. SNP genotype calls are provided as supplementary text files. Call data in the TXT files corresponding to the raw CEL files were generated using GTYPE ver. 4.0 with the Dynamic Model Mapping Algorithm. The threshold for Allele A, Allele B and Allele AB was 0.33.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Patricia,,Greninger!Sample_contact_email = pgreninger@partners.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Settleman Lab!Sample_contact_department = Center for Molecular Therapeutics!Sample_contact_institute = Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 149 13th St!Sample_contact_city = Charlestown!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02129!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385520/suppl/GSM385520.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385520/suppl/GSM385520.txt.gz!Sample_relation = Reanalyzed by: GSE85838!Sample_series_id = GSE15126!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = PLASQ copy number#SEGM = Segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SEGMSNP_A-1780619	3.020509	2.228262SNP_A-1780618	2.860746	2.291372SNP_A-1780617	1.046814	1.289968SNP_A-1780778	1.950042	1.805042SNP_A-1780616	1.662893	1.841857SNP_A-1780613	3.476868	3.247764SNP_A-1780419	1.975888	2.228262SNP_A-1780612	2.408462	2.275185SNP_A-1780418	1.241160	1.747245SNP_A-1780611	2.309012	2.271452SNP_A-1780610	2.187417	2.201939SNP_A-1780415	1.900404	1.747245SNP_A-1780576	2.198975	2.228262SNP_A-1780413	1.537716	1.266513SNP_A-1780412	1.135061	1.805042SNP_A-1780574	1.407406	1.799591SNP_A-1780379	1.240069	1.742958SNP_A-1780572	0.9100351	1.203251SNP_A-1780378	2.557634	3.143135SNP_A-1780377	1.247241	1.304551!sample_table_end
