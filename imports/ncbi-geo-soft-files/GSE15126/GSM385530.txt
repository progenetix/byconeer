PLASQ copy number and segmented copy number are included in Sample table. SNP genotype calls are provided as supplementary text files. Call data in the TXT files corresponding to the raw CEL files were generated using GTYPE ver. 4.0 with the Dynamic Model Mapping Algorithm. The threshold for Allele A, Allele B and Allele AB was 0.33.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Patricia,,Greninger!Sample_contact_email = pgreninger@partners.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Settleman Lab!Sample_contact_department = Center for Molecular Therapeutics!Sample_contact_institute = Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 149 13th St!Sample_contact_city = Charlestown!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02129!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385530/suppl/GSM385530.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385530/suppl/GSM385530.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15126!Sample_data_row_count = 238228#ID_REF = #VALUE = PLASQ copy number#SEGM = Segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SEGMSNP_A-1780358	2.041011	1.782138SNP_A-1780551	0.97447	1.662695SNP_A-1780357	2.048172	1.710281SNP_A-1780550	3.675825	3.017301SNP_A-1780352	2.037142	1.721394SNP_A-1780351	1.540190	1.723435SNP_A-1780350	1.642502	2.394291SNP_A-1780748	2.064740	1.737980SNP_A-1780747	1.519856	1.781126SNP_A-1780746	0.8689148	1.781126SNP_A-1780745	2.428654	2.208001SNP_A-1780743	2.352814	1.658125SNP_A-1780549	1.244982	1.782138SNP_A-1780547	1.71784	2.239974SNP_A-1780541	0.735317	1.710281SNP_A-1780346	2.67148	2.378027SNP_A-1780345	1.800352	2.293337SNP_A-1780342	1.982135	1.671978SNP_A-1780341	1.022334	1.71515SNP_A-1780340	1.713809	2.493935!sample_table_end
