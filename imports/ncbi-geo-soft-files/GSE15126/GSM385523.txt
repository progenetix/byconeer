PLASQ copy number and segmented copy number are included in Sample table. SNP genotype calls are provided as supplementary text files. Call data in the TXT files corresponding to the raw CEL files were generated using GTYPE ver. 4.0 with the Dynamic Model Mapping Algorithm. The threshold for Allele A, Allele B and Allele AB was 0.33.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Patricia,,Greninger!Sample_contact_email = pgreninger@partners.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Settleman Lab!Sample_contact_department = Center for Molecular Therapeutics!Sample_contact_institute = Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 149 13th St!Sample_contact_city = Charlestown!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02129!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385523/suppl/GSM385523.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385523/suppl/GSM385523.txt.gz!Sample_relation = Reanalyzed by: GSE85838!Sample_series_id = GSE15126!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = PLASQ copy number#SEGM = Segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SEGMSNP_A-1780619	2.742189	1.617599SNP_A-1780618	2.696534	1.611319SNP_A-1780617	1.853953	1.804856SNP_A-1780778	1.955893	1.643929SNP_A-1780616	2.216159	2.205673SNP_A-1780613	2.836078	3.05911SNP_A-1780419	2.546819	2.169362SNP_A-1780612	1.556725	2.013206SNP_A-1780418	1.896972	2.854788SNP_A-1780611	0.9466067	1.601274SNP_A-1780610	0.8089133	0.8852018SNP_A-1780415	2.628952	2.215085SNP_A-1780576	1.127408	1.550346SNP_A-1780413	3.156374	2.611192SNP_A-1780412	1.089015	1.643929SNP_A-1780574	0.895444	1.576424SNP_A-1780379	2.395688	1.835789SNP_A-1780572	1.466069	1.835077SNP_A-1780378	1.928504	2.470806SNP_A-1780377	2.448409	2.043177!sample_table_end
