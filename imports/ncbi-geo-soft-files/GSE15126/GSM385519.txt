PLASQ copy number and segmented copy number are included in Sample table. SNP genotype calls are provided as supplementary text files. Call data in the TXT files corresponding to the raw CEL files were generated using GTYPE ver. 4.0 with the Dynamic Model Mapping Algorithm. The threshold for Allele A, Allele B and Allele AB was 0.33.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Patricia,,Greninger!Sample_contact_email = pgreninger@partners.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Settleman Lab!Sample_contact_department = Center for Molecular Therapeutics!Sample_contact_institute = Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 149 13th St!Sample_contact_city = Charlestown!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02129!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385519/suppl/GSM385519.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385519/suppl/GSM385519.txt.gz!Sample_relation = Reanalyzed by: GSE85838!Sample_series_id = GSE15126!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = PLASQ copy number#SEGM = Segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SEGMSNP_A-1780619	3.554539	2.208001SNP_A-1780618	1.713703	1.721394SNP_A-1780617	1.980351	2.446137SNP_A-1780778	2.078959	1.782138SNP_A-1780616	2.284902	2.378620SNP_A-1780613	3.769522	3.558124SNP_A-1780419	1.890648	2.208001SNP_A-1780612	1.974049	1.704297SNP_A-1780418	1.576253	1.753954SNP_A-1780611	2.034843	1.721394SNP_A-1780610	0.801934	0.8877057SNP_A-1780415	1.85394	1.753954SNP_A-1780576	1.013469	1.313059SNP_A-1780413	1.643484	1.668784SNP_A-1780412	1.841602	1.738163SNP_A-1780574	1.636733	2.531533SNP_A-1780379	1.454021	1.675826SNP_A-1780572	1.632438	1.759016SNP_A-1780378	1.459034	1.712010SNP_A-1780377	2.004335	1.668784!sample_table_end
