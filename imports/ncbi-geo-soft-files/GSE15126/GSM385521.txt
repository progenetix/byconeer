PLASQ copy number and segmented copy number are included in Sample table. SNP genotype calls are provided as supplementary text files. Call data in the TXT files corresponding to the raw CEL files were generated using GTYPE ver. 4.0 with the Dynamic Model Mapping Algorithm. The threshold for Allele A, Allele B and Allele AB was 0.33.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Patricia,,Greninger!Sample_contact_email = pgreninger@partners.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Settleman Lab!Sample_contact_department = Center for Molecular Therapeutics!Sample_contact_institute = Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 149 13th St!Sample_contact_city = Charlestown!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02129!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385521/suppl/GSM385521.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385521/suppl/GSM385521.txt.gz!Sample_relation = Reanalyzed by: GSE85838!Sample_series_id = GSE15126!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = PLASQ copy number#SEGM = Segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SEGMSNP_A-1780619	3.608359	2.266932SNP_A-1780618	1.998887	2.202013SNP_A-1780617	1.323767	1.594173SNP_A-1780778	1.776576	1.850726SNP_A-1780616	2.343016	2.120335SNP_A-1780613	1.952552	2.117386SNP_A-1780419	1.892868	2.266932SNP_A-1780612	1.872270	2.232773SNP_A-1780418	1.462649	2.160686SNP_A-1780611	1.644712	2.159244SNP_A-1780610	1.657764	1.551297SNP_A-1780415	1.879418	2.160686SNP_A-1780576	1.358312	1.671174SNP_A-1780413	1.375647	1.547743SNP_A-1780412	2.28541	2.141181SNP_A-1780574	1.951135	2.246408SNP_A-1780379	0.8974416	1.653672SNP_A-1780572	1.665252	1.113495SNP_A-1780378	2.145092	2.500595SNP_A-1780377	1.700094	1.556293!sample_table_end
