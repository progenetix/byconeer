PLASQ copy number and segmented copy number are included in Sample table. SNP genotype calls are provided as supplementary text files. Call data in the TXT files corresponding to the raw CEL files were generated using GTYPE ver. 4.0 with the Dynamic Model Mapping Algorithm. The threshold for Allele A, Allele B and Allele AB was 0.33.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Patricia,,Greninger!Sample_contact_email = pgreninger@partners.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Settleman Lab!Sample_contact_department = Center for Molecular Therapeutics!Sample_contact_institute = Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 149 13th St!Sample_contact_city = Charlestown!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02129!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385526/suppl/GSM385526.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385526/suppl/GSM385526.txt.gz!Sample_relation = Reanalyzed by: GSE85838!Sample_series_id = GSE15126!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = PLASQ copy number#SEGM = Segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SEGMSNP_A-1780619	2.907311	2.28986SNP_A-1780618	1.552486	1.191741SNP_A-1780617	0.7709283	1.208637SNP_A-1780778	2.171226	2.546299SNP_A-1780616	1.436010	2.064645SNP_A-1780613	1.835920	2.067067SNP_A-1780419	1.860105	2.122222SNP_A-1780612	1.683889	2.055359SNP_A-1780418	2.478192	2.458425SNP_A-1780611	1.294096	1.191741SNP_A-1780610	1.933210	2.040376SNP_A-1780415	2.830226	2.458425SNP_A-1780576	1.590275	2.122222SNP_A-1780413	1.946468	1.619367SNP_A-1780412	1.258838	2.424556SNP_A-1780574	1.923926	1.669428SNP_A-1780379	0.4034237	1.190461SNP_A-1780572	1.131780	1.245529SNP_A-1780378	2.149198	2.02957SNP_A-1780377	1.338830	1.79581!sample_table_end
