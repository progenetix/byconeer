PLASQ copy number and segmented copy number are included in Sample table. SNP genotype calls are provided as supplementary text files. Call data in the TXT files corresponding to the raw CEL files were generated using GTYPE ver. 4.0 with the Dynamic Model Mapping Algorithm. The threshold for Allele A, Allele B and Allele AB was 0.33.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Patricia,,Greninger!Sample_contact_email = pgreninger@partners.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Settleman Lab!Sample_contact_department = Center for Molecular Therapeutics!Sample_contact_institute = Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 149 13th St!Sample_contact_city = Charlestown!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02129!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385518/suppl/GSM385518.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385518/suppl/GSM385518.txt.gz!Sample_relation = Reanalyzed by: GSE85838!Sample_series_id = GSE15126!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = PLASQ copy number#SEGM = Segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SEGMSNP_A-1780619	4.811827	2.751523SNP_A-1780618	3.233727	1.821450SNP_A-1780617	0.619892	1.085026SNP_A-1780778	2.420154	1.882465SNP_A-1780616	2.690836	1.836942SNP_A-1780613	3.298611	3.168550SNP_A-1780419	2.76745	2.500859SNP_A-1780612	3.001684	4.152907SNP_A-1780418	1.487735	1.814948SNP_A-1780611	1.267506	1.811447SNP_A-1780610	1.826130	1.739878SNP_A-1780415	2.301594	1.814948SNP_A-1780576	2.366428	2.500859SNP_A-1780413	1.670626	1.822400SNP_A-1780412	1.477851	1.882465SNP_A-1780574	1.501278	2.161366SNP_A-1780379	0.8803568	1.040125SNP_A-1780572	0.9794457	1.049648SNP_A-1780378	2.009148	2.603938SNP_A-1780377	2.612823	1.711584!sample_table_end
