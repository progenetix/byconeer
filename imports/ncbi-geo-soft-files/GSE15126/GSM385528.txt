PLASQ copy number and segmented copy number are included in Sample table. SNP genotype calls are provided as supplementary text files. Call data in the TXT files corresponding to the raw CEL files were generated using GTYPE ver. 4.0 with the Dynamic Model Mapping Algorithm. The threshold for Allele A, Allele B and Allele AB was 0.33.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Patricia,,Greninger!Sample_contact_email = pgreninger@partners.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Settleman Lab!Sample_contact_department = Center for Molecular Therapeutics!Sample_contact_institute = Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 149 13th St!Sample_contact_city = Charlestown!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02129!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385528/suppl/GSM385528.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385528/suppl/GSM385528.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15126!Sample_data_row_count = 238228#ID_REF = #VALUE = PLASQ copy number#SEGM = Segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SEGMSNP_A-1780358	2.428832	2.275535SNP_A-1780551	1.267244	1.624739SNP_A-1780357	1.781554	1.684952SNP_A-1780550	3.796588	2.853078SNP_A-1780352	3.572543	1.686676SNP_A-1780351	1.126617	1.681206SNP_A-1780350	2.035111	2.323877SNP_A-1780748	2.102750	1.623190SNP_A-1780747	1.019847	1.662637SNP_A-1780746	1.236068	1.662637SNP_A-1780745	2.003499	2.195261SNP_A-1780743	-0.4344054	0.1298897SNP_A-1780549	1.175011	2.275535SNP_A-1780547	1.445209	2.285396SNP_A-1780541	0.624625	1.684952SNP_A-1780346	3.829319	2.231043SNP_A-1780345	0.7343725	1.623190SNP_A-1780342	2.817882	2.132382SNP_A-1780341	1.503776	2.863771SNP_A-1780340	1.800679	2.785219!sample_table_end
