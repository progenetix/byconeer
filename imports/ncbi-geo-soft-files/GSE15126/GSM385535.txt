PLASQ copy number and segmented copy number are included in Sample table. SNP genotype calls are provided as supplementary text files. Call data in the TXT files corresponding to the raw CEL files were generated using GTYPE ver. 4.0 with the Dynamic Model Mapping Algorithm. The threshold for Allele A, Allele B and Allele AB was 0.33.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Patricia,,Greninger!Sample_contact_email = pgreninger@partners.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Settleman Lab!Sample_contact_department = Center for Molecular Therapeutics!Sample_contact_institute = Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 149 13th St!Sample_contact_city = Charlestown!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02129!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385535/suppl/GSM385535.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385535/suppl/GSM385535.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15126!Sample_data_row_count = 238228#ID_REF = #VALUE = PLASQ copy number#SEGM = Segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SEGMSNP_A-1780358	2.411579	2.017255SNP_A-1780551	0.6345688	0.9866497SNP_A-1780357	2.458379	1.400761SNP_A-1780550	3.720108	2.50757SNP_A-1780352	1.75214	1.415236SNP_A-1780351	0.6936433	1.403320SNP_A-1780350	1.591411	1.809952SNP_A-1780748	2.909963	1.961899SNP_A-1780747	1.144954	1.432257SNP_A-1780746	2.512451	2.597147SNP_A-1780745	0.8467647	1.419926SNP_A-1780743	2.965334	2.445552SNP_A-1780549	1.510834	1.997980SNP_A-1780547	1.486993	1.972459SNP_A-1780541	0.6196427	1.400761SNP_A-1780346	3.578176	1.957838SNP_A-1780345	1.433565	1.961899SNP_A-1780342	1.907215	1.412837SNP_A-1780341	1.531655	2.372703SNP_A-1780340	1.450710	1.982587!sample_table_end
