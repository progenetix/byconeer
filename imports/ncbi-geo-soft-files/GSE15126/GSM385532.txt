PLASQ copy number and segmented copy number are included in Sample table. SNP genotype calls are provided as supplementary text files. Call data in the TXT files corresponding to the raw CEL files were generated using GTYPE ver. 4.0 with the Dynamic Model Mapping Algorithm. The threshold for Allele A, Allele B and Allele AB was 0.33.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Patricia,,Greninger!Sample_contact_email = pgreninger@partners.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Settleman Lab!Sample_contact_department = Center for Molecular Therapeutics!Sample_contact_institute = Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 149 13th St!Sample_contact_city = Charlestown!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02129!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385532/suppl/GSM385532.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385532/suppl/GSM385532.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15126!Sample_data_row_count = 238228#ID_REF = #VALUE = PLASQ copy number#SEGM = Segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SEGMSNP_A-1780358	2.291061	1.850726SNP_A-1780551	1.140578	1.555981SNP_A-1780357	1.413615	1.721441SNP_A-1780550	1.860395	2.117386SNP_A-1780352	2.053884	2.202013SNP_A-1780351	2.54307	2.176029SNP_A-1780350	1.101338	1.620845SNP_A-1780748	2.327905	1.546036SNP_A-1780747	1.783983	1.619803SNP_A-1780746	0.737527	1.619803SNP_A-1780745	3.280961	2.266932SNP_A-1780743	3.001358	1.553765SNP_A-1780549	1.798868	2.191828SNP_A-1780547	2.518132	2.282254SNP_A-1780541	1.445447	1.721441SNP_A-1780346	2.587910	2.109499SNP_A-1780345	1.750142	1.546036SNP_A-1780342	2.106228	1.786658SNP_A-1780341	1.113188	1.265819SNP_A-1780340	1.884198	2.223036!sample_table_end
