PLASQ copy number and segmented copy number are included in Sample table. SNP genotype calls are provided as supplementary text files. Call data in the TXT files corresponding to the raw CEL files were generated using GTYPE ver. 4.0 with the Dynamic Model Mapping Algorithm. The threshold for Allele A, Allele B and Allele AB was 0.33.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Patricia,,Greninger!Sample_contact_email = pgreninger@partners.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Settleman Lab!Sample_contact_department = Center for Molecular Therapeutics!Sample_contact_institute = Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 149 13th St!Sample_contact_city = Charlestown!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02129!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385531/suppl/GSM385531.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385531/suppl/GSM385531.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15126!Sample_data_row_count = 238228#ID_REF = #VALUE = PLASQ copy number#SEGM = Segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SEGMSNP_A-1780358	1.500451	1.805042SNP_A-1780551	1.056743	1.233247SNP_A-1780357	2.411228	2.185731SNP_A-1780550	2.338583	1.908680SNP_A-1780352	3.734754	2.291372SNP_A-1780351	1.867623	1.866423SNP_A-1780350	1.565960	1.790560SNP_A-1780748	1.538742	1.282522SNP_A-1780747	1.568166	1.951084SNP_A-1780746	0.890503	1.951084SNP_A-1780745	2.582893	2.228262SNP_A-1780743	2.623437	1.828317SNP_A-1780549	1.028697	1.805042SNP_A-1780547	1.804970	2.242385SNP_A-1780541	1.577555	3.032254SNP_A-1780346	3.149388	2.221794SNP_A-1780345	0.9179577	1.282522SNP_A-1780342	1.950401	1.917300SNP_A-1780341	0.2112426	2.616847SNP_A-1780340	1.678373	1.889196!sample_table_end
