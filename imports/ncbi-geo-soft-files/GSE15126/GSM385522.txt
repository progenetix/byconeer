PLASQ copy number and segmented copy number are included in Sample table. SNP genotype calls are provided as supplementary text files. Call data in the TXT files corresponding to the raw CEL files were generated using GTYPE ver. 4.0 with the Dynamic Model Mapping Algorithm. The threshold for Allele A, Allele B and Allele AB was 0.33.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Patricia,,Greninger!Sample_contact_email = pgreninger@partners.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Settleman Lab!Sample_contact_department = Center for Molecular Therapeutics!Sample_contact_institute = Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 149 13th St!Sample_contact_city = Charlestown!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02129!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385522/suppl/GSM385522.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385522/suppl/GSM385522.txt.gz!Sample_relation = Reanalyzed by: GSE85838!Sample_series_id = GSE15126!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = PLASQ copy number#SEGM = Segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SEGMSNP_A-1780619	2.320138	1.708085SNP_A-1780618	1.65324	1.643367SNP_A-1780617	1.145357	1.646014SNP_A-1780778	3.296963	2.329311SNP_A-1780616	2.290396	2.302340SNP_A-1780613	1.118519	1.64806SNP_A-1780419	1.235307	1.618549SNP_A-1780612	3.074517	2.919741SNP_A-1780418	1.993400	2.213978SNP_A-1780611	1.350549	1.643367SNP_A-1780610	1.604029	1.602445SNP_A-1780415	1.929187	2.213978SNP_A-1780576	2.061662	1.618549SNP_A-1780413	1.895136	1.640703SNP_A-1780412	2.082871	2.250082SNP_A-1780574	1.281618	1.647350SNP_A-1780379	1.291487	1.636918SNP_A-1780572	1.339298	1.691388SNP_A-1780378	0.9582731	1.6381SNP_A-1780377	2.141432	1.55094!sample_table_end
