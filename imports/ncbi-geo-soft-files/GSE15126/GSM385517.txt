PLASQ copy number and segmented copy number are included in Sample table. SNP genotype calls are provided as supplementary text files. Call data in the TXT files corresponding to the raw CEL files were generated using GTYPE ver. 4.0 with the Dynamic Model Mapping Algorithm. The threshold for Allele A, Allele B and Allele AB was 0.33.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Patricia,,Greninger!Sample_contact_email = pgreninger@partners.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Settleman Lab!Sample_contact_department = Center for Molecular Therapeutics!Sample_contact_institute = Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 149 13th St!Sample_contact_city = Charlestown!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02129!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385517/suppl/GSM385517.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385517/suppl/GSM385517.txt.gz!Sample_relation = Reanalyzed by: GSE85838!Sample_series_id = GSE15126!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = PLASQ copy number#SEGM = Segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SEGMSNP_A-1780619	1.294411	1.689579SNP_A-1780618	1.663446	1.670996SNP_A-1780617	1.687723	1.624739SNP_A-1780778	2.063057	2.275535SNP_A-1780616	3.77087	2.689617SNP_A-1780613	3.468879	3.296122SNP_A-1780419	1.927817	2.195261SNP_A-1780612	2.071155	2.182112SNP_A-1780418	1.798033	2.275535SNP_A-1780611	0.913194	1.686676SNP_A-1780610	1.328985	1.579389SNP_A-1780415	3.606913	2.275535SNP_A-1780576	2.109139	2.195261SNP_A-1780413	1.416522	1.656277SNP_A-1780412	2.257266	2.275535SNP_A-1780574	1.695777	2.282038SNP_A-1780379	0.8354877	0.9379188SNP_A-1780572	2.37264	2.273369SNP_A-1780378	2.182701	2.276442SNP_A-1780377	1.711702	1.656277!sample_table_end
