PLASQ copy number and segmented copy number are included in Sample table. SNP genotype calls are provided as supplementary text files. Call data in the TXT files corresponding to the raw CEL files were generated using GTYPE ver. 4.0 with the Dynamic Model Mapping Algorithm. The threshold for Allele A, Allele B and Allele AB was 0.33.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Patricia,,Greninger!Sample_contact_email = pgreninger@partners.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Settleman Lab!Sample_contact_department = Center for Molecular Therapeutics!Sample_contact_institute = Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 149 13th St!Sample_contact_city = Charlestown!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02129!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385534/suppl/GSM385534.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385534/suppl/GSM385534.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15126!Sample_data_row_count = 238228#ID_REF = #VALUE = PLASQ copy number#SEGM = Segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SEGMSNP_A-1780358	1.826820	1.668792SNP_A-1780551	1.251971	1.804856SNP_A-1780357	1.656653	1.621341SNP_A-1780550	3.290273	3.51075SNP_A-1780352	1.841363	1.601274SNP_A-1780351	1.572755	1.615598SNP_A-1780350	1.979616	2.710104SNP_A-1780748	2.0279	1.661114SNP_A-1780747	2.541635	2.327190SNP_A-1780746	1.032142	2.436292SNP_A-1780745	1.684612	1.605975SNP_A-1780743	2.929072	1.604805SNP_A-1780549	1.084914	1.643929SNP_A-1780547	1.988398	2.180994SNP_A-1780541	0.636422	1.621341SNP_A-1780346	2.806804	2.178762SNP_A-1780345	1.56191	1.661114SNP_A-1780342	2.800497	2.713673SNP_A-1780341	2.329193	2.905051SNP_A-1780340	0.9057805	1.588533!sample_table_end
