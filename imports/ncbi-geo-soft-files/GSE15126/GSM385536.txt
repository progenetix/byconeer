PLASQ copy number and segmented copy number are included in Sample table. SNP genotype calls are provided as supplementary text files. Call data in the TXT files corresponding to the raw CEL files were generated using GTYPE ver. 4.0 with the Dynamic Model Mapping Algorithm. The threshold for Allele A, Allele B and Allele AB was 0.33.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Patricia,,Greninger!Sample_contact_email = pgreninger@partners.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Settleman Lab!Sample_contact_department = Center for Molecular Therapeutics!Sample_contact_institute = Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 149 13th St!Sample_contact_city = Charlestown!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02129!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385536/suppl/GSM385536.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385536/suppl/GSM385536.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15126!Sample_data_row_count = 238228#ID_REF = #VALUE = PLASQ copy number#SEGM = Segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SEGMSNP_A-1780358	1.900261	2.195559SNP_A-1780551	1.404900	1.581339SNP_A-1780357	2.411396	2.154133SNP_A-1780550	4.348288	3.128456SNP_A-1780352	5.575856	3.116527SNP_A-1780351	1.826027	1.815296SNP_A-1780350	2.122621	2.625062SNP_A-1780748	2.196907	1.980299SNP_A-1780747	1.611741	1.880923SNP_A-1780746	1.624343	2.281171SNP_A-1780745	2.169181	2.043669SNP_A-1780743	0.8885269	0.6632791SNP_A-1780549	0.9339204	1.247713SNP_A-1780547	1.219227	1.673364SNP_A-1780541	1.149661	2.165712SNP_A-1780346	1.945471	1.892702SNP_A-1780345	2.378294	1.878227SNP_A-1780342	2.263537	1.811061SNP_A-1780341	1.777175	2.105797SNP_A-1780340	2.144034	2.997625!sample_table_end
