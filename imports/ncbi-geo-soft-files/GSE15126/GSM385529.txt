PLASQ copy number and segmented copy number are included in Sample table. SNP genotype calls are provided as supplementary text files. Call data in the TXT files corresponding to the raw CEL files were generated using GTYPE ver. 4.0 with the Dynamic Model Mapping Algorithm. The threshold for Allele A, Allele B and Allele AB was 0.33.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Patricia,,Greninger!Sample_contact_email = pgreninger@partners.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Settleman Lab!Sample_contact_department = Center for Molecular Therapeutics!Sample_contact_institute = Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 149 13th St!Sample_contact_city = Charlestown!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02129!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385529/suppl/GSM385529.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385529/suppl/GSM385529.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15126!Sample_data_row_count = 238228#ID_REF = #VALUE = PLASQ copy number#SEGM = Segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SEGMSNP_A-1780358	1.696626	1.882465SNP_A-1780551	0.5417723	1.021152SNP_A-1780357	1.507112	1.798453SNP_A-1780550	3.676238	3.168550SNP_A-1780352	1.855815	1.821450SNP_A-1780351	1.953848	1.799149SNP_A-1780350	1.287663	1.897179SNP_A-1780748	2.500687	1.818065SNP_A-1780747	1.8404	1.847086SNP_A-1780746	1.14331	2.449205SNP_A-1780745	2.587875	2.500859SNP_A-1780743	3.159513	1.749632SNP_A-1780549	1.237654	1.882465SNP_A-1780547	2.77658	2.498732SNP_A-1780541	0.950295	1.798453SNP_A-1780346	2.457334	1.817384SNP_A-1780345	1.770621	1.818065SNP_A-1780342	1.839644	1.798465SNP_A-1780341	0.6701556	1.035113SNP_A-1780340	1.931521	2.528941!sample_table_end
