PLASQ copy number and segmented copy number are included in Sample table. SNP genotype calls are provided as supplementary text files. Call data in the TXT files corresponding to the raw CEL files were generated using GTYPE ver. 4.0 with the Dynamic Model Mapping Algorithm. The threshold for Allele A, Allele B and Allele AB was 0.33.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Patricia,,Greninger!Sample_contact_email = pgreninger@partners.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Settleman Lab!Sample_contact_department = Center for Molecular Therapeutics!Sample_contact_institute = Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 149 13th St!Sample_contact_city = Charlestown!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02129!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385525/suppl/GSM385525.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385525/suppl/GSM385525.txt.gz!Sample_relation = Reanalyzed by: GSE85838!Sample_series_id = GSE15126!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = PLASQ copy number#SEGM = Segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SEGMSNP_A-1780619	3.080599	2.204953SNP_A-1780618	2.300910	1.904449SNP_A-1780617	1.555721	1.877816SNP_A-1780778	1.840586	1.891724SNP_A-1780616	2.638527	2.671988SNP_A-1780613	2.815263	3.128456SNP_A-1780419	1.800185	2.043669SNP_A-1780612	1.408925	1.576469SNP_A-1780418	1.812872	1.971930SNP_A-1780611	1.304711	1.926743SNP_A-1780610	3.301603	2.848033SNP_A-1780415	2.441901	3.091819SNP_A-1780576	2.301519	2.06818SNP_A-1780413	1.801851	1.959202SNP_A-1780412	1.81922	1.925992SNP_A-1780574	1.259927	1.672580SNP_A-1780379	1.503473	1.625335SNP_A-1780572	1.935975	2.124965SNP_A-1780378	2.860318	2.820097SNP_A-1780377	1.936628	2.044181!sample_table_end
