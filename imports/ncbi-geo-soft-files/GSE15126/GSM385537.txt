PLASQ copy number and segmented copy number are included in Sample table. SNP genotype calls are provided as supplementary text files. Call data in the TXT files corresponding to the raw CEL files were generated using GTYPE ver. 4.0 with the Dynamic Model Mapping Algorithm. The threshold for Allele A, Allele B and Allele AB was 0.33.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Patricia,,Greninger!Sample_contact_email = pgreninger@partners.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Settleman Lab!Sample_contact_department = Center for Molecular Therapeutics!Sample_contact_institute = Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 149 13th St!Sample_contact_city = Charlestown!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02129!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385537/suppl/GSM385537.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM385nnn/GSM385537/suppl/GSM385537.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE15126!Sample_data_row_count = 238228#ID_REF = #VALUE = PLASQ copy number#SEGM = Segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SEGMSNP_A-1780358	2.567580	2.546299SNP_A-1780551	0.9457386	1.185347SNP_A-1780357	2.790788	1.699045SNP_A-1780550	3.635225	2.067067SNP_A-1780352	1.598670	1.191741SNP_A-1780351	0.9127916	1.329523SNP_A-1780350	2.318429	2.149582SNP_A-1780748	2.406084	2.132969SNP_A-1780747	1.275963	1.917333SNP_A-1780746	0.8414506	1.303882SNP_A-1780745	1.311369	2.122222SNP_A-1780743	2.048551	1.734925SNP_A-1780549	1.550379	2.546299SNP_A-1780547	0.76593	1.775121SNP_A-1780541	0.5534682	1.699045SNP_A-1780346	5.076922	2.477413SNP_A-1780345	1.956385	2.132969SNP_A-1780342	2.962964	1.993973SNP_A-1780341	1.223532	2.16591SNP_A-1780340	1.664866	2.21384!sample_table_end
