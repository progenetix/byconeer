Normalization of the individual tumor (or tumor cell)'s SNP array data was performed with a newly developed method termed Tangent normalization (full desciption pending in Getz, et al; manuscript in preparation).  For Tangent normalization, SNP array data from as large a pool of non-cancerous normal samples as possible are obtained.  In this analysis, we used data from >1100 normal samples.  The SNP data from these normals are used to generate a  high-dimensional hyperplane that represents all linear combinations of the signal intensities seen in the normal samples; we then project each tumor sample onto this plane to find the 'hypothetical reference' sample that most closely matches that tumor, and use this reference point to infer the copy number.  After the copy-number are inferred from this new technique, we use the GLAD segmentation/smoothing algorithm to further process the data.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Adam,Joel,Bass!Sample_contact_email = adam_bass@dfci.harvard.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Dana-Farber Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 44 Binney Street!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM449nnn/GSM449668/suppl/GSM449668_TE8.cel.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE17958!Sample_data_row_count = 238230#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 copy number ratio via tangent normalization!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1909444	0.554SNP_A-2237149	0.554SNP_A-4303947	0.554SNP_A-2236359	0.554SNP_A-2205441	0.554SNP_A-2116190	0.554SNP_A-4291020	0.554SNP_A-2109914	0.554SNP_A-2291997	0.554SNP_A-4277872	0.554SNP_A-2118217	0.554SNP_A-1866065	0.554SNP_A-2288244	0.554SNP_A-1783407	0.554SNP_A-2169457	0.554SNP_A-4271011	0.554SNP_A-2082515	0.554SNP_A-1910751	0.554SNP_A-2081399	0.554SNP_A-2223642	0.554!sample_table_end
