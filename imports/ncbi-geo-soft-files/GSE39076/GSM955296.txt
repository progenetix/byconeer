DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer and Qubit.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = MOT_4691T!Sample_description = hybridized to SNP6!Sample_data_processing = CHP files were generated using the Affymetrix Genotyping Console algorithm Birdseed v2. Total and allele-specific copy number analysis was performed using Partek Genomics Suite 6.5, using both paired copy number generation.!Sample_data_processing = CEL and CHP files are provided for each sample in the study. Processed/normalized data for the germline DNA samples not provided because they themselves are normalised to a diploid copy number, making all the probe values 2, which is not informative.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sally,,Hunter!Sample_contact_email = Sally.Hunter@petermac.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genetics!Sample_contact_department = Research!Sample_contact_institute = Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = 7 St Andrew's Pl!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 3002!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM955nnn/GSM955296/suppl/GSM955296_MOT_4691T.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM955nnn/GSM955296/suppl/GSM955296_MOT_4691T.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE39076!Sample_data_row_count = 1855448#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalised total copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-SNP_10000979	2.37383AFFX-SNP_10009702	1.69975AFFX-SNP_10015773	1.96804AFFX-SNP_10021569	1.35105AFFX-SNP_10026879	1.53038AFFX-SNP_10029725	1.96835AFFX-SNP_10034687	2.18274AFFX-SNP_10036267	1.96015AFFX-SNP_10037362	3.03386AFFX-SNP_10037636	1.5002AFFX-SNP_10039349	1.82871AFFX-SNP_10039442	2.28382AFFX-SNP_10039933	1.84391AFFX-SNP_10046830	1.38343AFFX-SNP_10047363	1.71125AFFX-SNP_10047841	1.82562AFFX-SNP_10049334	2.27391AFFX-SNP_10052664	2.06952AFFX-SNP_10057887	2.00287AFFX-SNP_10064911	1.28595!sample_table_end
