DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer and Qubit.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = MOT_446T!Sample_description = hybridized to STYI 250K!Sample_data_processing = CHP files were generated using the Affymetrix Genotyping Console algorithm Birdseed v2. Total and allele-specific copy number analysis was performed using Partek Genomics Suite 6.5, using both paired copy number generation.!Sample_data_processing = CEL and CHP files are provided for each sample in the study. Processed/normalized data for the germline DNA samples not provided because they themselves are normalised to a diploid copy number, making all the probe values 2, which is not informative.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Sally,,Hunter!Sample_contact_email = Sally.Hunter@petermac.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genetics!Sample_contact_department = Research!Sample_contact_institute = Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = 7 St Andrew's Pl!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 3002!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM955nnn/GSM955357/suppl/GSM955357_MOT_446T_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM955nnn/GSM955357/suppl/GSM955357_MOT_446T_Sty.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE39076!Sample_data_row_count = 238378#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalised total copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-2315047	3.12253AFFX-2315048	2.7162AFFX-2315049	3.43183AFFX-2315050	1.18556AFFX-2315051	2.92955AFFX-2315052	2.47093AFFX-2315053	3.2102AFFX-2315054	3.3072AFFX-2315055	2.65499AFFX-2315056	1.85747AFFX-2315057	1.7073AFFX-2315058	2.37311AFFX-2315059	2.18062AFFX-2315060	2.58702AFFX-2315061	1.6243AFFX-2315062	2.30544AFFX-2315063	2.16155AFFX-2315064	1.15737AFFX-2315065	1.27439AFFX-2315066	2.07756!sample_table_end
