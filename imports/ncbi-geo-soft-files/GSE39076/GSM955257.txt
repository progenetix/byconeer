DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer and Qubit.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = MOT_11142S!Sample_description = hybridized to SNP6!Sample_data_processing = CHP files were generated using the Affymetrix Genotyping Console algorithm Birdseed v2. Total and allele-specific copy number analysis was performed using Partek Genomics Suite 6.5, using both paired copy number generation.!Sample_data_processing = CEL and CHP files are provided for each sample in the study. Processed/normalized data for the germline DNA samples not provided because they themselves are normalised to a diploid copy number, making all the probe values 2, which is not informative.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sally,,Hunter!Sample_contact_email = Sally.Hunter@petermac.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genetics!Sample_contact_department = Research!Sample_contact_institute = Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = 7 St Andrew's Pl!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 3002!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM955nnn/GSM955257/suppl/GSM955257_MOT_11142S.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM955nnn/GSM955257/suppl/GSM955257_MOT_11142S.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE39076!Sample_data_row_count = 1855448#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalised total copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-SNP_10000979	2.65024AFFX-SNP_10009702	2.29911AFFX-SNP_10015773	1.74997AFFX-SNP_10021569	2.93906AFFX-SNP_10026879	1.97172AFFX-SNP_10029725	1.34255AFFX-SNP_10034687	1.88317AFFX-SNP_10036267	2.53771AFFX-SNP_10037362	1.95225AFFX-SNP_10037636	2.53935AFFX-SNP_10039349	2.15373AFFX-SNP_10039442	1.96634AFFX-SNP_10039933	1.77655AFFX-SNP_10046830	2.08928AFFX-SNP_10047363	2.23227AFFX-SNP_10047841	1.50008AFFX-SNP_10049334	1.77837AFFX-SNP_10052664	2.35713AFFX-SNP_10057887	2.05696AFFX-SNP_10064911	1.58528!sample_table_end
