DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer and Qubit.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = MOT_289T!Sample_description = hybridized to STYI 250K!Sample_data_processing = CHP files were generated using the Affymetrix Genotyping Console algorithm Birdseed v2. Total and allele-specific copy number analysis was performed using Partek Genomics Suite 6.5, using both paired copy number generation.!Sample_data_processing = CEL and CHP files are provided for each sample in the study. Processed/normalized data for the germline DNA samples not provided because they themselves are normalised to a diploid copy number, making all the probe values 2, which is not informative.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Sally,,Hunter!Sample_contact_email = Sally.Hunter@petermac.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genetics!Sample_contact_department = Research!Sample_contact_institute = Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = 7 St Andrew's Pl!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 3002!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM955nnn/GSM955355/suppl/GSM955355_MOT_289T_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM955nnn/GSM955355/suppl/GSM955355_MOT_289T_Sty.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE39076!Sample_data_row_count = 238378#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalised total copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-2315047	2.73953AFFX-2315048	0.821787AFFX-2315049	1.08761AFFX-2315050	2.95075AFFX-2315051	1.53528AFFX-2315052	1.35803AFFX-2315053	1.56049AFFX-2315054	1.69331AFFX-2315055	0.490082AFFX-2315056	3.13894AFFX-2315057	1.85316AFFX-2315058	1.00921AFFX-2315059	2.46744AFFX-2315060	2.60837AFFX-2315061	11.5841AFFX-2315062	5.26418AFFX-2315063	1.16914AFFX-2315064	2.78563AFFX-2315065	1.55511AFFX-2315066	1.06804!sample_table_end
