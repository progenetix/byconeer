DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer and Qubit.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = MOT_446T!Sample_description = hybridized to NSPI 250K!Sample_data_processing = CHP files were generated using the Affymetrix Genotyping Console algorithm Birdseed v2. Total and allele-specific copy number analysis was performed using Partek Genomics Suite 6.5, using both paired copy number generation.!Sample_data_processing = CEL and CHP files are provided for each sample in the study. Processed/normalized data for the germline DNA samples not provided because they themselves are normalised to a diploid copy number, making all the probe values 2, which is not informative.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Sally,,Hunter!Sample_contact_email = Sally.Hunter@petermac.org!Sample_contact_laboratory = Cancer Genetics!Sample_contact_department = Research!Sample_contact_institute = Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = 7 St Andrew's Pl!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = VIC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 3002!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM955nnn/GSM955351/suppl/GSM955351_MOT_446T_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM955nnn/GSM955351/suppl/GSM955351_MOT_446T_Nsp.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE39076!Sample_data_row_count = 262338#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalised total copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-2315047	2.36319AFFX-2315048	1.52634AFFX-2315049	2.065AFFX-2315050	2.67306AFFX-2315051	2.1458AFFX-2315052	1.8148AFFX-2315053	2.6164AFFX-2315054	2.19254AFFX-2315055	2.17942AFFX-2315056	1.56031AFFX-2315057	2.1075AFFX-2315058	1.95188AFFX-2315059	1.88467AFFX-2315060	2.27708AFFX-2315061	2.20669AFFX-2315062	2.30915AFFX-2315063	2.43779AFFX-2315064	3.00295AFFX-2315065	2.02131AFFX-2315066	2.21618!sample_table_end
