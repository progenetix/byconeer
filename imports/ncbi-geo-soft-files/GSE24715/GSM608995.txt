DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The hybridized arrays were washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to 50K_Xba!Sample_data_processing = CEL files and TXT files were generated by Affymetrix GeneChip DNA Analysis Software version 3.0, Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT) versions 2.2 and 3.0, Affymetrix GeneChip Genotyping Operating Analysis software version 4.1 and Partek Genomics Suite version 6.3.  The 50K data were calculated in CNAT using an algorithm developed to identify genome wide gains and losses on high density oligonucleotide arrays based on SNP genotyping metods and whole genome sampling analysis.  The raw data were analyzed with CNAT to calculate a copy number at each locus, which was then normalized relative to a reference set of normal individuals.  The copy number estimates were displayed with a genome smoothed analysis, which incorporates Gaussian kernel smoothing over the default genomic filter length of 0.5 Mb.  Data from the 250K array were analyzed with the Hidden Markov Model default settings in the Copy Number work flow in Partek Genomics Suite.  The respective Hap Map samples were used as normals for both the 50K and 250K chips.!Sample_data_processing = The 50K CNAT data contains probe set id, physical chromosome position, genotype call (SNP call) AA, AB, BB, NC no call, GSA_CN genomic smoothed analysis of the copy number, GSA_pVal genomic smoothed analysis of the significance value and Log2 Ratio.  The 250K data .txt files analyzed on Partek contain the probe set ID and the copy number generated using the Copy Number workflow in Partek Genomic Suite.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Frederic ,,Barr!Sample_contact_email = barrfg@mail.med.upenn.edu!Sample_contact_institute = University of Pennsylvania!Sample_contact_address = 422 Curie Blvd!Sample_contact_city = Philadelphia!Sample_contact_state = PA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 19104!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM608nnn/GSM608995/suppl/GSM608995_Barr_Amp_SNP0102B_PALKPZ_Mapping50K_Xba240.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE24715!Sample_data_row_count = 58960#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#GSA_CN = #GSA_pVal = #Log2Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	GSA_CN	GSA_pVal	Log2RatioSNP_A-1677174	AA	2.694303	1.58467	0.607641SNP_A-1678466	BB	3.08015	1.596352	1.234157SNP_A-1676440	AA	3.076993	1.590595	2.447019SNP_A-1662392	AB	2.892941	1.349548	0.530259SNP_A-1685736	AB	2.892745	1.349226	0.820277SNP_A-1681384	AB	2.88555	1.337345	0.171934SNP_A-1642581	BB	2.83465	1.253405	-0.366476SNP_A-1669029	NoCall	2.83115	1.24764	-0.006894SNP_A-1718237	AA	2.263314	0.394068	0.291011SNP_A-1748467	AA	2.263278	0.393992	0.02951SNP_A-1705537	AA	2.034943	0.125551	0.314797SNP_A-1683756	AA	2.034946	0.125536	-0.501615SNP_A-1696782	NoCall	2.278842	0.471308	-0.422163SNP_A-1673422	BB	2.285907	0.489602	0.428135SNP_A-1670878	BB	2.46563	1.092757	1.054019SNP_A-1743511	BB	2.465636	1.092778	0.247348SNP_A-1736635	BB	2.487039	1.048495	0.763372SNP_A-1666738	BB	2.546961	1.080261	0.012474SNP_A-1721407	AA	2.391196	0.762077	0.454514SNP_A-1686722	AA	2.390525	0.75757	-0.252361!sample_table_end
