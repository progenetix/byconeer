DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The hybridized arrays were washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to 50K_Xba!Sample_data_processing = CEL files and TXT files were generated by Affymetrix GeneChip DNA Analysis Software version 3.0, Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT) versions 2.2 and 3.0, Affymetrix GeneChip Genotyping Operating Analysis software version 4.1 and Partek Genomics Suite version 6.3.  The 50K data were calculated in CNAT using an algorithm developed to identify genome wide gains and losses on high density oligonucleotide arrays based on SNP genotyping metods and whole genome sampling analysis.  The raw data were analyzed with CNAT to calculate a copy number at each locus, which was then normalized relative to a reference set of normal individuals.  The copy number estimates were displayed with a genome smoothed analysis, which incorporates Gaussian kernel smoothing over the default genomic filter length of 0.5 Mb.  Data from the 250K array were analyzed with the Hidden Markov Model default settings in the Copy Number work flow in Partek Genomics Suite.  The respective Hap Map samples were used as normals for both the 50K and 250K chips.!Sample_data_processing = The 50K CNAT data contains probe set id, physical chromosome position, genotype call (SNP call) AA, AB, BB, NC no call, GSA_CN genomic smoothed analysis of the copy number, GSA_pVal genomic smoothed analysis of the significance value and Log2 Ratio.  The 250K data .txt files analyzed on Partek contain the probe set ID and the copy number generated using the Copy Number workflow in Partek Genomic Suite.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Frederic ,,Barr!Sample_contact_email = barrfg@mail.med.upenn.edu!Sample_contact_institute = University of Pennsylvania!Sample_contact_address = 422 Curie Blvd!Sample_contact_city = Philadelphia!Sample_contact_state = PA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 19104!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM608nnn/GSM608997/suppl/GSM608997_Barr_Amp_SNP0077B_PAJALC_Mapping50K_Xba240.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE24715!Sample_data_row_count = 58960#ID_REF = #VALUE = genotype call#GSA_CN = #GSA_pVal = #Log2Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	GSA_CN	GSA_pVal	Log2RatioSNP_A-1677174	AA	1.813682	-0.692948	-0.260126SNP_A-1678466	BB	2.111022	0.119354	0.953006SNP_A-1676440	AA	2.109897	0.123022	0.402441SNP_A-1662392	AA	2.024742	0.346939	0.006134SNP_A-1685736	AA	2.024666	0.34717	-0.554297SNP_A-1681384	BB	2.021843	0.355678	-0.005916SNP_A-1642581	BB	2.00185	0.416142	0.145536SNP_A-1669029	NoCall	2.000473	0.420318	-1.081549SNP_A-1718237	AA	1.782204	-0.876299	-0.136559SNP_A-1748467	AA	1.78219	-0.876385	-0.695615SNP_A-1705537	AB	2.411359	0.068059	0.261322SNP_A-1683756	AA	2.411381	0.067935	-0.239758SNP_A-1696782	AB	2.297232	0.080093	-1.480342SNP_A-1673422	BB	2.29831	0.057023	1.742822SNP_A-1670878	BB	2.245426	0.413361	0.367808SNP_A-1743511	BB	2.245407	0.413359	-0.480442SNP_A-1736635	BB	1.763434	-2.242211	0.257069SNP_A-1666738	AB	1.866524	-1.951515	-0.699533SNP_A-1721407	AA	1.781723	-2.592708	-0.306919SNP_A-1686722	AA	1.782839	-2.593706	-1.789595!sample_table_end
