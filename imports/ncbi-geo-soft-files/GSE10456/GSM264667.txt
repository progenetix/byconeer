The resulting amplified DNA was purified using the Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Canada) and quantified using a DynaQuant Fluorimeter (Amersham Biosciences).!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = SCOMP amplification: Genomic DNA was digested with 2 U MseI (New England Biolabs) for 3 hours in One-Phor-All Buffer (Amersham) in a final volume of 5 mL.  Base pairing of the adaptor nucleotides was done in a final volume of 3 mL using 0.5 mL    One-Phor-All Buffer, 0.5m 100 mM Lib1 oligonucleotide (5â-AGTGGGATTCCTGCTGTCAGT-3â) and 0.5 mL 100 mM ddMse11 oligonucleotide (5â-TAACTGACAGCdd-3â) in a MJ Research PT100 thermocycler programmed for a gradient of 65Â°C to 15Â°C ramped down at 1Â°C per minute.   1 mL T4 DNA Ligase (40U/mL) (Roche), 1 mL of 10 mM ATP and the MseI digested genomic DNA was added and allowed to incubate at 15Â°C overnight. For PCR amplification the following was added to the ligation mix: 3 mL Expand Long Template buffer 1 (Roche), 2 mL 10 mM dNTPs, 35 mL H2O and 1 mL Expand-Long-Template PolMix (3.5U/mL).  Thermocycler conditions were as follows:  1 cycle, 68Â°C for 3 mins; 15 cycles 40 sec @ 94Â°C, 30 sec @ 57Â°C, 1 min 30 sec + 1 sec/cycle @ 68Â°C; 8 cycles 40 sec @ 94Â°C, 30 sec @ 57Â°C + 1Â°C/cycle, 1 min 45 sec + 1 sec/cycle @ 68Â°C; 22 cycles 40 sec @ 94Â°C, 30 sec @ 65Â°C, 1 min 53 sec + 1 sec/cycle @ 68Â°C; 1 cycle 3 min 40 sec @ 68Â°C.   Several reactions were pooled together.  A negative control (template=water) was used for all steps to ensure there was no contamination.  Following PCR amplification, the resulting products were cleaned with the Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Canada) and quantitated using a DynaQuant Fluorimeter (Amersham Biosciences).!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 1.0Î¼g of amplified test and reference DNA was mixed with 21.5Î¼l ddH2O and 20Î¼l of 2.5X Random Primer/Reaction Mix Buffer (Invitrogen, www.invitrogen.com), boiled for 5 min. and 5Î¼l of âlow Câ dNTP mix with either 2.5Î¼l Cy5-dCTP (Amersham Biosciences, USA) for test or Cy3 for the reference DNA with 1Î¼l of Klenow solution, then incubated at 37Â°C for 2 hrs.  The reaction was stopped by adding EDTA, then 450Î¼l of TE pH 7.4 added and the mix loaded onto a micron-30 filter (Fisher/Millipore), spun for 8-10 min. at 10,000 rpm, inverted and spun for 1 min to recover the purified probe.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Human placenta!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Fresh tissue!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = DNA extracted  using a QIAGEN DNA Mini Kit (QUIAGEN Inc., Canada) after a 72 hr period in lysis buffer at 56Â°C.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = DOP amplification: Degenerate oligonucleotide primed (DOP)-PCR: 10-100 ng of genomic DNA was amplified by Thermo Sequenase (Amersham Biosciences) in a low stringency pre-amplification step (5 cycles) followed by regular PCR amplification in less stringent conditions, several replicate reactions were pooled together and a negative control (template = water) was used to ensure absence of contamination.
