The hybridization solution was denatured for 10 minutes at 72C and incubated for 1 hour at 37C to allow blocking of repetitive sequences. Hybridizations were performed in slide chambers for 48 hours at 37C.!Sample_scan_protocol = After post-hybridization washes, arrays were rinsed, spun dry, scanned into two 16-bit TIFF image files using a GenePix4200A two-color fluorescent scanner, and signal was quantified using GenePix software (Axon Instruments).!Sample_description = 915445.gpr!Sample_data_processing = Log2-transformed fluorescence ratios were calculated from background-subtracted median intensity values, and these ratios were used for normalization using intensity normalization methods. To adjust for effects due to variation between the red and green dyes, LOWESS normalization was applied. Then, the ratio of the red/ green channel of each clone was calculated and log2 transformed. Spot quality criteria were set as foreground to background greater than 3.0 and standard deviation of triplicates less than 0.2. The breakpoint detection and status assignment of genomic regions was performed using GLAD software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8690!Sample_contact_name = Jiun,,Kang!Sample_contact_email = ju2497@gmail.com!Sample_contact_phone = 917-575-0205!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Columbia University!Sample_contact_address = 1130 St. Nicholas Avenue!Sample_contact_city = New York!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 10032!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM417nnn/GSM417081/suppl/GSM417081.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM417nnn/GSM417081/suppl/GSM417081_915445_NOR_DATA.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16597!Sample_data_row_count = 4044#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 mean value!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	0.71862	0.08993	0.11184	-0.02755	0.06776	0.05547	0.1648	0.1979	10	0.180211	0.112912	0.072213	0.082414	0.058915	0.00116	0.024517	0.146418	-0.024219	0.07620	-0.0588!sample_table_end
