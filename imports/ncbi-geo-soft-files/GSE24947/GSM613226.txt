BED files with methylation score calculated as the 1-log2 of the hybridization intensities before/after MSRE treatment are added. Replication timing: Cel files of G1 and early-S fractions of the cell cycle, obtained from exponentially grown EBV-transformed lymphocytes, hybridized to Affymetrix SNP mapping microarrays. Bed file corresponding this calculation is added.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Asaf,,Hellman!Sample_contact_email = asafh@ekmd.huji.ac.il!Sample_contact_phone = 972-2-6758476!Sample_contact_fax = 972-2-6758243!Sample_contact_department = Developmental Biology and Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Hebrew University!Sample_contact_address = Hadassah Medical School!Sample_contact_city = Jerusalem!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 91120!Sample_contact_country = Israel!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM613nnn/GSM613226/suppl/GSM613226.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE24947!Sample_data_row_count = 0
