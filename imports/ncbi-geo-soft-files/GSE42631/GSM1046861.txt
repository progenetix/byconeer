DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer  and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridize to Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array!Sample_data_processing = The array images were acquired using GeneChipÂ® Operating Software (GCOS) and Affymetrix GeneChipÂ®Command Console Software (AGCC). Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Genotyping Console version  4.1.1.834 (chp files). Genomic analysis was performed by using the DNA chip Analyze (dChip) and CNAG 3.3.0.1 software.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description: Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = MariaDolores,,Tabernero!Sample_contact_email = taberner@usal.es!Sample_contact_fax = 0034-923-264795!Sample_contact_laboratory = Unidad de InvestigaciÃ³n!Sample_contact_institute = Hospital Universitario de Salamanca y Centro del CÃ¡ncer!Sample_contact_address = Paseo San Vicente 58-182!Sample_contact_city = Salamanca!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 37007!Sample_contact_country = Spain!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1046nnn/GSM1046861/suppl/GSM1046861_G65TSNP_6.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1046nnn/GSM1046861/suppl/GSM1046861_G65TSNP_6.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE42631!Sample_data_row_count = 909622
