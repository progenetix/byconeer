To identify regions of similar genomic status within the array-CGH data, we applied the segmentation software GLAD. Imbalances with log2 ratios of less than -1.0 were scored as putative homozygous deletions, because this threshold corresponds to an average copy number of less than 1, suggesting the presence of at least one subpopulation of cells with homozygous deletions. Gains with log2 ratios higher than 1.0 were scored as amplifications. Chromosomal mapping information was based on Ensembl (v49) and position of candidate genes was verified using Ensembl v52.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13171!Sample_contact_name = Hendrik,,Witt!Sample_contact_email = h.witt@dkfz.de!Sample_contact_phone = +496221424594!Sample_contact_fax = +496221424639!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center!Sample_contact_address = INF 580!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_state = BW!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM675nnn/GSM675456/suppl/GSM675456.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27286!Sample_series_id = GSE27287!Sample_data_row_count = 10469#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized by print-tip loess log2 ration (tumor/control)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEG000001	0.336564083G000002	0.080791414G000003	-0.003180681G000004	0.00710677G000005	-0.364678543G000006	0.09128587G000007	0.014899268G000008	-0.039792671G000009	0.169190977G000010	-0.067308946G000011	-0.048026497G000012	0.155073624G000013	-0.029434198G000015	0.043596158G000016	-0.035837233G000017	0.092893191G000018	-0.022343092G000019	0.002262859G000020	0.079130893G000021	0.003098934!sample_table_end
