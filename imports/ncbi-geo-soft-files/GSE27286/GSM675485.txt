To identify regions of similar genomic status within the array-CGH data, we applied the segmentation software GLAD. Imbalances with log2 ratios of less than -1.0 were scored as putative homozygous deletions, because this threshold corresponds to an average copy number of less than 1, suggesting the presence of at least one subpopulation of cells with homozygous deletions. Gains with log2 ratios higher than 1.0 were scored as amplifications. Chromosomal mapping information was based on Ensembl (v49) and position of candidate genes was verified using Ensembl v52.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13171!Sample_contact_name = Hendrik,,Witt!Sample_contact_email = h.witt@dkfz.de!Sample_contact_phone = +496221424594!Sample_contact_fax = +496221424639!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center!Sample_contact_address = INF 580!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_state = BW!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM675nnn/GSM675485/suppl/GSM675485.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27286!Sample_series_id = GSE27287!Sample_data_row_count = 10469#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized by print-tip loess log2 ration (tumor/control)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEG000001	0.088091353G000002	0.031122176G000003	-0.13301989G000004	0.062136955G000005	-0.198718101G000006	0.073055219G000007	-0.151812375G000008	-0.107097942G000009	-0.055478881G000010	-0.296642601G000011	-0.237544049G000012	0.196542874G000013	-0.238880397G000015	-0.072523523G000016	-0.12112838G000017	0.012472917G000018	-0.162568623G000019	-0.069338004G000020	0.285961315G000021	0.250898031!sample_table_end
