To identify regions of similar genomic status within the array-CGH data, we applied the segmentation software GLAD. Imbalances with log2 ratios of less than -1.0 were scored as putative homozygous deletions, because this threshold corresponds to an average copy number of less than 1, suggesting the presence of at least one subpopulation of cells with homozygous deletions. Gains with log2 ratios higher than 1.0 were scored as amplifications. Chromosomal mapping information was based on Ensembl (v49) and position of candidate genes was verified using Ensembl v52.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13171!Sample_contact_name = Hendrik,,Witt!Sample_contact_email = h.witt@dkfz.de!Sample_contact_phone = +496221424594!Sample_contact_fax = +496221424639!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center!Sample_contact_address = INF 580!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_state = BW!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM675nnn/GSM675465/suppl/GSM675465.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27286!Sample_series_id = GSE27287!Sample_data_row_count = 10469#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized by print-tip loess log2 ration (tumor/control)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEG000001	0.405658017G000002	0.054410955G000003	-0.042530459G000004	G000005	-0.266728768G000006	0.082741473G000007	0.012376343G000008	-0.091157379G000009	0.13379868G000010	-0.112586519G000011	-0.124849659G000012	0.03169306G000013	-0.06203167G000015	-0.029247268G000016	-0.036306454G000017	-0.080839805G000018	-0.176694654G000019	-0.001521284G000020	0.074445607G000021	0.075860042!sample_table_end
