To identify regions of similar genomic status within the array-CGH data, we applied the segmentation software GLAD. Imbalances with log2 ratios of less than -1.0 were scored as putative homozygous deletions, because this threshold corresponds to an average copy number of less than 1, suggesting the presence of at least one subpopulation of cells with homozygous deletions. Gains with log2 ratios higher than 1.0 were scored as amplifications. Chromosomal mapping information was based on Ensembl (v49) and position of candidate genes was verified using Ensembl v52.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13171!Sample_contact_name = Hendrik,,Witt!Sample_contact_email = h.witt@dkfz.de!Sample_contact_phone = +496221424594!Sample_contact_fax = +496221424639!Sample_contact_laboratory = Prof. Peter Lichter!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = German Cancer Research Center!Sample_contact_address = INF 580!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_state = BW!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM675nnn/GSM675503/suppl/GSM675503.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27286!Sample_series_id = GSE27287!Sample_data_row_count = 10469#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized by print-tip loess log2 ration (tumor/control)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEG000001	G000002	0.111486148G000003	-0.031163395G000004	G000005	-0.204736572G000006	0.106818808G000007	-0.044496982G000008	-0.003894342G000009	G000010	-0.059342029G000011	-0.078622428G000012	0.109360751G000013	-0.088400206G000015	-0.063792418G000016	-0.062019007G000017	0.232993414G000018	-0.021301469G000019	-0.170404672G000020	0.104415814G000021	-0.014345945!sample_table_end
