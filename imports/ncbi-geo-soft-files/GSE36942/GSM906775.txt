Following normalization of the raw data, the log2ratio of Cy3 (tumor) to Cy5 (Control) was calculated. Aberrant regions were determined by the ADM-2 algorithm at a threshold of 7.0 in DNA Analytics. To detect gains and losses, we set the values of parameters for aberration filters as: minimum number of probes in region 2, minimum absolute average log2ratio for region 0., maximum number of aberrant regions 10000, and percentage penetrance per feature 0. We set the value of the minimum absolute average log2ratio at 0.163 to detect regions showing a change in the averaged copy number equal to or more than 1.12-fold (log2(1.12)=0.163).!Sample_platform_id = GPL5477!Sample_contact_name = shunichi,,yoshioka!Sample_contact_email = syoshioka@oita-u.ac.jp!Sample_contact_department = Depertment of Molecular Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Faculty of Medicine, Oita University!Sample_contact_address = Hasama-machi Idaigaoka 1-1!Sample_contact_city = Yufu-city!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 879-5593!Sample_contact_country = Japan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM906nnn/GSM906775/suppl/GSM906775_Case_17_NMPT-9858_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07_1_2.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE36942!Sample_data_row_count = 45214#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	-4.000619629e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	0.000000000e+0005	0.000000000e+0006	0.000000000e+0007	0.000000000e+0008	0.000000000e+0009	0.000000000e+00010	0.000000000e+00011	0.000000000e+00012	2.026779235e-00113	7.911969023e-00314	9.416843464e-00215	8.144897248e-00316	1.052608113e-00117	1.161903115e-00118	8.468746551e-00219	7.415549746e-00320	1.170290868e-001!sample_table_end
