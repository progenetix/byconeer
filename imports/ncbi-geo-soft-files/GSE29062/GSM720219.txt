GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = O9!Sample_description = SNP array data from renal cell carcinoma!Sample_description = PUNAS_p_Kinome_misc_AFFX_n_GenomeWideSNP_6_C03_238214.CEL!Sample_data_processing = Probe-level signal intensities (i.e. copy number data)  were normalized to a baseline array with median intensity using invariant set normalization and SNP-level signal intensities were obtained using a model-based (PM/MM) method. Significant regions of copy-number variation were determined using the Genomic Identification of Significant Targets In Cancer (GISTIC) method. SN, gene, and cytogenetic band locations are based on the hg18 genome build (http://genome.ucsc.edu). For the comparison between the Euclidean distance distributions among profiles of different subgroups, p-values were calculated by permuting group labels.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chiara,,Grisanzio!Sample_contact_email = cgrisanzio@partners.org!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = DFCI!Sample_contact_address = 44 Binney Street!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM720nnn/GSM720219/suppl/GSM720219.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29062!Sample_data_row_count = 1851810#ID_REF = #VALUE = signal intensities refer to copy number data!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUECN_000263	-0.042457CN_000265	0.111031CN_000274	0.782409CN_000281	0.100305CN_000285	0.075875CN_000288	0.946731CN_000292	0.325386CN_000296	-0.281036CN_000297	0.832687CN_000306	-0.805913CN_000307	-0.114035CN_000310	-0.241270CN_000329	0.641084CN_000331	0.034920CN_000347	0.360645CN_000348	-1.305788CN_000370	0.048236CN_000381	-0.108581CN_000385	-0.449099CN_000401	-0.005058!sample_table_end
