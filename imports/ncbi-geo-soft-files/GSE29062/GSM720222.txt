GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = X10!Sample_description = SNP array data from renal cell carcinoma!Sample_description = PUNAS_p_Kinome_misc_AFFX_n_GenomeWideSNP_6_C06_238220.CEL!Sample_data_processing = Probe-level signal intensities (i.e. copy number data)  were normalized to a baseline array with median intensity using invariant set normalization and SNP-level signal intensities were obtained using a model-based (PM/MM) method. Significant regions of copy-number variation were determined using the Genomic Identification of Significant Targets In Cancer (GISTIC) method. SN, gene, and cytogenetic band locations are based on the hg18 genome build (http://genome.ucsc.edu). For the comparison between the Euclidean distance distributions among profiles of different subgroups, p-values were calculated by permuting group labels.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chiara,,Grisanzio!Sample_contact_email = cgrisanzio@partners.org!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = DFCI!Sample_contact_address = 44 Binney Street!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM720nnn/GSM720222/suppl/GSM720222.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29062!Sample_data_row_count = 1851810#ID_REF = #VALUE = signal intensities refer to copy number data!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUECN_000263	0.852798CN_000265	0.336855CN_000274	0.372395CN_000281	-0.059645CN_000285	-0.052147CN_000288	0.317304CN_000292	0.411968CN_000296	0.237564CN_000297	0.942984CN_000306	-0.265345CN_000307	0.163499CN_000310	-0.267080CN_000329	0.533065CN_000331	0.600745CN_000347	0.327687CN_000348	-0.289827CN_000370	0.913033CN_000381	0.336283CN_000385	0.365133CN_000401	0.323082!sample_table_end
