GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = X6!Sample_description = SNP array data from renal cell carcinoma!Sample_description = PUNAS_p_Kinome_misc_AFFX_n_GenomeWideSNP_6_B12_238208.CEL!Sample_data_processing = Probe-level signal intensities (i.e. copy number data)  were normalized to a baseline array with median intensity using invariant set normalization and SNP-level signal intensities were obtained using a model-based (PM/MM) method. Significant regions of copy-number variation were determined using the Genomic Identification of Significant Targets In Cancer (GISTIC) method. SN, gene, and cytogenetic band locations are based on the hg18 genome build (http://genome.ucsc.edu). For the comparison between the Euclidean distance distributions among profiles of different subgroups, p-values were calculated by permuting group labels.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chiara,,Grisanzio!Sample_contact_email = cgrisanzio@partners.org!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = DFCI!Sample_contact_address = 44 Binney Street!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM720nnn/GSM720216/suppl/GSM720216.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29062!Sample_data_row_count = 1851810#ID_REF = #VALUE = signal intensities refer to copy number data!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUECN_000263	0.837136CN_000265	0.013641CN_000274	0.681224CN_000281	0.691534CN_000285	-0.053643CN_000288	0.053111CN_000292	0.738119CN_000296	0.147958CN_000297	0.763412CN_000306	0.239398CN_000307	0.555816CN_000310	0.608336CN_000329	0.888695CN_000331	0.805705CN_000347	0.702658CN_000348	0.872238CN_000370	0.685716CN_000381	0.457857CN_000385	0.055196CN_000401	-0.008682!sample_table_end
