GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.!Sample_description = X13!Sample_description = SNP array data from renal cell carcinoma!Sample_description = PUNAS_p_Kinome_misc_AFFX_n_GenomeWideSNP_6_C12_238232.CEL!Sample_data_processing = Probe-level signal intensities (i.e. copy number data)  were normalized to a baseline array with median intensity using invariant set normalization and SNP-level signal intensities were obtained using a model-based (PM/MM) method. Significant regions of copy-number variation were determined using the Genomic Identification of Significant Targets In Cancer (GISTIC) method. SN, gene, and cytogenetic band locations are based on the hg18 genome build (http://genome.ucsc.edu). For the comparison between the Euclidean distance distributions among profiles of different subgroups, p-values were calculated by permuting group labels.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chiara,,Grisanzio!Sample_contact_email = cgrisanzio@partners.org!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = DFCI!Sample_contact_address = 44 Binney Street!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM720nnn/GSM720228/suppl/GSM720228.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE29062!Sample_data_row_count = 1851810#ID_REF = #VALUE = signal intensities refer to copy number data!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUECN_000263	1.362891CN_000265	-0.144808CN_000274	0.991318CN_000281	0.249142CN_000285	-0.502260CN_000288	0.880881CN_000292	0.869871CN_000296	0.620586CN_000297	0.327112CN_000306	0.171207CN_000307	0.280956CN_000310	-0.038747CN_000329	0.526570CN_000331	0.876173CN_000347	0.577248CN_000348	-0.697827CN_000370	0.799087CN_000381	0.384602CN_000385	0.746313CN_000401	0.150560!sample_table_end
