To facilitate haemolysis of RBCs it is recommended to store a fresh sample for a few hours in a freezer as freezing destroys the red cells. After thawing, 3mls of whole blood are transferred to a sterile conical centrifuge tube (15ml volume) to which 9mls of 1 x erythrocyte lysing buffer (0.155M NH4Cl; 10mM KHCO3; 0.1mM Na2 EDTA; pH 7.4) must be added. The solution is left for 10 minutes at RT with occasional mixing by inversion followed by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 4000 rpm. After centrifugation the supernatant is discarded and a white pellet will be observed at the bottom of the tube. This pellet must be washed for at least 3 times by adding 3mls of erythrocyte lysing buffer and repeating steps 3 and 4. It is important to breakdown the pellet and rinse it well in erythrocyte lysing buffer in order to clean the white blood cells from remaining heme. 1.5mls of SE buffer (75mM NaCl; 25mM Na2 EDTA; pH 8.0) containing 100mg/ml of Proteinase K and 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS w/v), are added to the pellet. The tubes are then incubated at a temperature of 37-55ÂºC (optimal temp for Proteinase K activity) overnight in a water bath or incubator. During this step the white blood cells' membranes are denatured and DNA goes out in solution. After the incubation, 1.5mls of SE buffer together with 750ml of 6M (saturated) NaCl are added to each tube, followed by the addition of 3.75mls chloroform. The tubes are mixed vigorously (on a vortex) for about 20 sec with occasional mixing for at least 30min. Alternatively you can leave the tubes on a rotator for 1 hour. The emulsion will then be centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm with minimal breaking force. After centrifugation 2 phases are observed and care must be taken not to disturb the interphase. During this step DNA is extracted into the supernatant and proteins separated into the lower phase. The upper aqueous phase (containing the DNA) is transferred into a clean and sterile conical centrifuge tube using a sterile Pasteur pipette, followed by the addition of an equal volume of isopropanol. DNA will be precipitated by gentle swirling of the tube and is observed visually as a white thread like strand. Using a sterile spatula or loop transfer the DNA strand into a sterile microcentrifuge tube containing 1ml of 75% ethanol. The DNA is then washed by inversion to clean it from any remaining salts and the tube centrifuged at 11000g for 4 minutes. The supernatant is discarded taking care not to discard the pellet. Repeat this step once more. After discarding the supernatant the pellet is dried from excess ethanol either by using a vacuum centrifuge or by leaving the tubes open and inverted in an oven at around 50 - 65ÂºC for an hour. The dried pellet is resuspended in TE buffer (1M Tris-HCl; 0.5M EDTA; pH 8.0) and left overnight on a rotator. DNA concentration is determined either by agarose gel electrophoresis or spectrophotometry and adjusted to the desired concentration by adding more TE buffer. It is important to note that before adjusting and reading DNA concentrations one must obtain a homogeneous sample of DNA which is not quite easy acquired since DNA is very viscous. To adjust to lower concentration one must used other quantitation methods such as Picogreen (Molecular Probes) using spectrofluorometry as spectrophotometry is not accurate and sensitive at very low concentrations. !Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = For each sample, 100 ng genomic DNA was amplified using the BioScore kit (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY):!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = AMPLIFYING THE GENOMIC DNA !Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = In order to establish the lower and upper limits of the amplification reaction, a negative control reaction (no template DNA) and a positive control reaction (100 ng of Excellent high quality, non-FFPE genomic DNA) should be included in the protocol.

A block-median normalization excluding controls was applied to the 2log-transformed Cy3/Cy5 ratios. Subsequent exclusion criteria were: confidence <0.3, quality <1 and SD of replicates >0.5. Log-ratios of replicates were combined using the fusion algorithm. The resulting log-ratios were imported into Nexus-software Copy Number-V3.1 (BioDiscovery, US) to visualise and analyse copy number changes within or between subsets of SCC.!Sample_data_processing = The confidence flag filter selection: A and B (= confidence > 0.7)!Sample_data_processing = Postprocessing protocol:!Sample_data_processing = - Normalization then exclusion!Sample_data_processing = - Block median normalization excluding controls!Sample_data_processing = Next, exclude spots if:!Sample_data_processing = - ID = controls, THEN!Sample_data_processing = - Confidence < 0.3, THEN!Sample_data_processing = - Quality < 1, THEN!Sample_data_processing = - Replicates with StdDEV > 0.5!Sample_data_processing = Next:!Sample_data_processing = - Replicates are combined based on âNameâ, using âFusionâ algorithm!Sample_data_processing = Remark: Although this software package includes algorithms that deal with the (local) background, the background values are not listed in any of the output files.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7096!Sample_contact_name = Mirjam,,Boelens!Sample_contact_institute = UMCG!Sample_contact_address = Hanzeplein 1!Sample_contact_city = Groningen!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 9713 GZ!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM308nnn/GSM308028/suppl/GSM308028.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12280!Sample_data_row_count = 5910#ID_REF = #VALUE = logratio Cy5(sample)/Cy3(reference)#CH1 = normalized Cy5 signal#CH2 = normalized Cy3 signal!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1	CH2CTA-125H2	0.895	2703.388	1453.889CTA-150C2	0.578	1571.418	1053.038CTA-221G9	0.644	2010.468	1286.341CTA-221H1	0.670	2053.888	1290.846CTA-228A9	0.845	760.050	423.109CTA-250D10	0.583	1386.568	925.547CTA-268H5	0.566	1720.807	1162.432CTA-299D3	0.361	1964.044	1529.743CTA-29F11	0.657	1881.803	1193.142CTA-390B3	0.744	1956.751	1168.346CTA-397C4	0.659	1103.610	698.890CTA-415G2	0.667	4423.261	2786.461CTA-445C9	0.669	2304.789	1449.186CTA-485g10	-0.344	1227.470	1557.946CTA-530h11	-0.259	846.481	1012.882CTA-57G9	0.554	1412.303	962.095CTA-670b5	-0.107	856.839	922.661CTA-722E9	0.523	1667.174	1160.464CTA-799F10	0.441	521.935	384.449CTA-951c11	-0.042	713.107	734.172!sample_table_end
