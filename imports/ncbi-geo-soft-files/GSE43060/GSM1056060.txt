DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer and agarose gel eletrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA was labelled according to the standard Affymetrix protocol for the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Labelled DNA was hybridised according to manufacturerâs protocol.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned according to manufacturerâs protocol.!Sample_data_processing = The microarray data was processed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console (GTC) v4.0 to determine data quality. Genotype data was checked using the Concordance Check function within GTC to ensure no sampling errors had occurred during array processing. Copy number alterations were determined for 10 patients using the paired remission sample and the Hapmap894 reference 5 set within Partek Genomics Suite v6.5 (Partek, USA) as the reference for the remaining sample (L625). Further analysis, visualization and identification of genomic gains and losses were performed using Partek Genomics Suite v6.5 (Partek, USA) and SNPView2 v2.6 (Ilixa, UK). Regions of aberration were mapped according to the human reference sequence GRCh37.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Vikki,,Rand!Sample_contact_email = vikki.rand@newcastle.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Lymphoma Genomics!Sample_contact_department = Northern Institute for Cancer Research!Sample_contact_institute = Newcastle University!Sample_contact_address = Paul O'Gorman Building, Newcastle University!Sample_contact_city = Newcastle Upon Tyne!Sample_contact_state = Tyne and Wear!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = NE12 4HH!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1056nnn/GSM1056060/suppl/GSM1056060_S1233_NSP_140607.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1056nnn/GSM1056060/suppl/GSM1056060_S1233_NSP_140607.brlmm.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE43060!Sample_data_row_count = 262314
