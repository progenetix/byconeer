The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672847/suppl/GSM672847_2714_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672847/suppl/GSM672847_2714_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.002127	BB	-0.666550	12.131129AFFX-2315061	AB	0.001601	AB	0.126279	11.312484AFFX-2315062	AA	0.001656	AA	0.591789	10.667129AFFX-2315057	AB	0.004368	AB	-0.164391	10.877769AFFX-2315058	AA	0.001793	AA	0.684040	11.600875AFFX-2315059	AB	0.000433	AB	0.219446	10.552350AFFX-2315063	AA	0.000981	AA	0.783185	10.753776AFFX-2315064	AB	0.000272	AB	0.219449	11.052797AFFX-2315065	AB	0.015720	AB	0.008195	10.536367AFFX-2315066	AA	0.004017	AA	0.700288	10.775048AFFX-2315067	BB	0.001823	BB	-0.544392	11.204162AFFX-2315068	BB	0.014306	BB	-0.660825	10.997224AFFX-2315069	AB	0.004291	AB	-0.121371	10.855847AFFX-2315070	AB	0.000085	AB	-0.108385	10.900482AFFX-2315071	BB	0.031624	BB	-0.705233	10.050735AFFX-2315072	AA	0.015493	AA	0.576732	10.943876AFFX-2315073	AA	0.012861	AA	0.751514	11.033464AFFX-2315074	AB	0.011863	AB	-0.062149	10.607253AFFX-2315075	AB	0.002812	AB	0.156540	11.704348AFFX-2315076	AB	0.003594	AB	0.028911	11.016579!sample_table_end
