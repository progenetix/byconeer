The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672850/suppl/GSM672850_3094_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672850/suppl/GSM672850_3094_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.008472	AB	-0.142630	12.130620AFFX-2315061	AA	0.000962	AA	0.826318	11.241863AFFX-2315062	AB	0.002946	AB	-0.079913	10.772167AFFX-2315057	AB	0.024900	AB	-0.202336	10.840234AFFX-2315058	BB	0.004650	BB	-0.716180	10.982653AFFX-2315059	AB	0.007185	AB	0.257753	10.489323AFFX-2315063	AA	0.000506	AA	0.801915	10.801560AFFX-2315064	AB	0.001807	AB	0.256357	11.014566AFFX-2315065	AB	0.021093	AB	-0.114523	10.569141AFFX-2315066	AB	0.003938	AB	-0.029794	10.757417AFFX-2315067	BB	0.001020	BB	-0.532601	11.218199AFFX-2315068	AB	0.016382	AB	0.272579	10.900976AFFX-2315069	AB	0.006921	AB	-0.220750	10.731850AFFX-2315070	BB	0.012385	BB	-0.694865	11.025107AFFX-2315071	AB	0.010828	AB	-0.177505	9.756836AFFX-2315072	AB	0.006306	AB	-0.034364	10.894416AFFX-2315073	BB	0.000339	BB	-0.613981	10.850301AFFX-2315074	BB	0.012227	BB	-0.632325	10.516021AFFX-2315075	AB	0.001605	AB	0.144622	11.706996AFFX-2315076	AB	0.000928	AB	0.050041	10.979297!sample_table_end
