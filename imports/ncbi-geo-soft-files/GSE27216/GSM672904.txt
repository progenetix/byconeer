The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672904/suppl/GSM672904_5993_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672904/suppl/GSM672904_5993_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.017947	AB	-0.196098	12.224999AFFX-2315061	AB	0.000169	AB	0.128007	11.703730AFFX-2315062	BB	0.012605	BB	-0.684128	10.433473AFFX-2315057	AA	0.038427	AA	0.429999	10.396833AFFX-2315058	AA	0.021634	AA	0.664425	12.109854AFFX-2315059	AA	0.017277	AA	0.749500	10.828719AFFX-2315063	AA	0.004810	AA	0.787137	10.738864AFFX-2315064	AB	0.431541	AB	0.372838	10.167286AFFX-2315065	AB	0.021658	AB	-0.008264	10.442134AFFX-2315066	BB	0.006624	BB	-0.659958	10.548720AFFX-2315067	AB	0.066366	AB	0.152290	11.434728AFFX-2315068	BB	0.007403	BB	-0.690870	10.554086AFFX-2315069	AB	0.022292	AB	-0.097818	10.057459AFFX-2315070	AA	0.015349	AA	0.460194	10.339598AFFX-2315071	BB	0.003091	BB	-0.804790	10.423012AFFX-2315072	AB	0.011944	AB	0.041537	11.300878AFFX-2315073	AB	0.001648	AB	0.130871	10.668245AFFX-2315074	AB	0.007273	AB	0.131446	10.048877AFFX-2315075	AB	0.036093	AB	0.068897	11.937731AFFX-2315076	AA	0.002371	AA	0.561361	11.168799!sample_table_end
