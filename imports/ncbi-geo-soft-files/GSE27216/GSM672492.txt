The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672492/suppl/GSM672492_9313_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672492/suppl/GSM672492_9313_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.008911	AA	0.747131	11.811631AFFX-2315061	AB	0.006214	AB	0.130086	10.819506AFFX-2315062	BB	0.005432	BB	-0.676736	10.195323AFFX-2315057	AB	0.016665	AB	-0.025699	10.377722AFFX-2315058	AA	0.037538	AA	0.816317	11.793726AFFX-2315059	AB	0.006497	AB	0.282934	10.678987AFFX-2315063	AB	0.006265	AB	-0.100767	10.738195AFFX-2315064	AA	0.024450	AA	0.689179	9.937000AFFX-2315065	AA	0.078496	AA	0.371692	10.067081AFFX-2315066	AB	0.131919	AB	-0.307182	10.111587AFFX-2315067	BB	0.035015	BB	-0.654771	10.793686AFFX-2315068	BB	0.006332	BB	-0.817806	10.430582AFFX-2315069	AA	0.035835	AA	0.669455	9.463705AFFX-2315070	AB	0.003572	AB	-0.082279	10.441269AFFX-2315071	AB	0.004184	AB	-0.177764	10.141513AFFX-2315072	AB	0.001351	AB	0.093150	11.066777AFFX-2315073	AB	0.020241	AB	0.241513	10.579971AFFX-2315074	BB	0.045151	BB	-0.410929	9.782104AFFX-2315075	AA	0.022219	AA	0.776375	11.374234AFFX-2315076	BB	0.005430	BB	-0.703700	10.986822!sample_table_end
