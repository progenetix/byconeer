The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672432/suppl/GSM672432_8160_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672432/suppl/GSM672432_8160_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.061754	AA	0.534611	11.831853AFFX-2315061	AB	0.001220	AB	0.106120	11.002123AFFX-2315062	AA	0.010286	AA	0.578173	10.466357AFFX-2315057	BB	0.020195	BB	-0.587657	10.903483AFFX-2315058	AA	0.043032	AA	0.656390	11.364969AFFX-2315059	AB	0.005210	AB	0.276116	10.453922AFFX-2315063	AB	0.000829	AB	-0.085848	10.799620AFFX-2315064	AB	0.003494	AB	0.212299	10.833029AFFX-2315065	BB	0.148422	BB	-0.370197	10.367410AFFX-2315066	BB	0.011245	BB	-0.620370	10.486288AFFX-2315067	BB	0.009255	BB	-0.547555	10.998420AFFX-2315068	BB	0.001170	BB	-0.635379	10.520729AFFX-2315069	AB	0.000285	AB	-0.139496	10.540778AFFX-2315070	BB	0.012470	BB	-0.662177	10.728977AFFX-2315071	BB	0.003788	BB	-0.708026	9.734267AFFX-2315072	AA	0.008692	AA	0.515825	10.819486AFFX-2315073	AA	0.005332	AA	0.746016	10.615851AFFX-2315074	BB	0.008285	BB	-0.586356	10.361669AFFX-2315075	AB	0.014689	AB	0.127871	11.621586AFFX-2315076	AB	0.016858	AB	0.038152	10.807322!sample_table_end
