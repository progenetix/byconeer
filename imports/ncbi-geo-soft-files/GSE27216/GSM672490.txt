The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672490/suppl/GSM672490_8994_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672490/suppl/GSM672490_8994_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.009107	BB	-0.698970	12.316188AFFX-2315061	AA	0.019761	AA	0.846960	11.392710AFFX-2315062	AB	0.097852	AB	0.068647	10.935419AFFX-2315057	AB	0.168547	AB	0.028977	10.857518AFFX-2315058	AB	0.003409	AB	0.176156	12.277812AFFX-2315059	AB	0.020333	AB	0.243081	11.189324AFFX-2315063	AA	0.056309	AA	0.777746	11.038043AFFX-2315064	AB	0.099594	AB	0.259480	10.526924AFFX-2315065	AB	0.149758	AB	-0.133121	10.770504AFFX-2315066	BB	0.034179	BB	-0.691631	10.700988AFFX-2315067	AA	0.040289	AA	0.592876	11.590771AFFX-2315068	BB	0.019414	BB	-0.758606	11.016846AFFX-2315069	AA	0.010545	AA	0.618785	10.134614AFFX-2315070	BB	0.025286	BB	-0.602953	10.710480AFFX-2315071	BB	0.109719	BB	-0.845919	10.818354AFFX-2315072	AA	0.178020	AA	0.773557	11.625988AFFX-2315073	AA	0.069119	AA	0.763467	11.098126AFFX-2315074	BB	0.051464	BB	-0.413642	10.278824AFFX-2315075	AA	0.075577	AA	0.721816	12.066564AFFX-2315076	BB	0.048940	BB	-0.674769	11.568956!sample_table_end
