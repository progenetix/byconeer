The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672849/suppl/GSM672849_3094_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672849/suppl/GSM672849_3094_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.026794	AB	-0.184291	12.164511AFFX-2315061	AB	0.000052	AB	0.105521	11.259453AFFX-2315062	AB	0.016028	AB	-0.130593	10.935490AFFX-2315057	NC	0.694734	BB	-0.409950	10.579671AFFX-2315058	AB	0.007088	AB	0.078041	11.315152AFFX-2315059	AA	0.003316	AA	0.754713	10.674699AFFX-2315063	AA	0.000985	AA	0.800202	10.845153AFFX-2315064	AB	0.005896	AB	0.247229	11.161577AFFX-2315065	AB	0.006039	AB	-0.012917	10.556154AFFX-2315066	BB	0.011933	BB	-0.655764	10.820618AFFX-2315067	BB	0.006363	BB	-0.521955	11.254722AFFX-2315068	AB	0.000303	AB	0.192019	10.849175AFFX-2315069	AB	0.013535	AB	-0.201521	10.920435AFFX-2315070	BB	0.008304	BB	-0.665493	10.985286AFFX-2315071	AB	0.005127	AB	-0.065959	10.008710AFFX-2315072	AB	0.042241	AB	-0.180683	10.992426AFFX-2315073	AB	0.008868	AB	0.203128	11.025387AFFX-2315074	BB	0.017289	BB	-0.646710	10.663382AFFX-2315075	AB	0.003780	AB	0.144807	11.817157AFFX-2315076	AA	0.009386	AA	0.529033	11.044574!sample_table_end
