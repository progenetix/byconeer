The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672884/suppl/GSM672884_1780_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672884/suppl/GSM672884_1780_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.002091	BB	-0.733237	12.203516AFFX-2315061	AB	0.005031	AB	0.177597	11.832521AFFX-2315062	AB	0.013291	AB	-0.134012	10.512441AFFX-2315057	AA	0.028870	AA	0.433972	10.476520AFFX-2315058	BB	0.001788	BB	-0.794450	11.865776AFFX-2315059	AA	0.004512	AA	0.804590	11.042546AFFX-2315063	AB	0.026530	AB	-0.207823	11.145700AFFX-2315064	AB	0.017569	AB	0.284074	10.174801AFFX-2315065	BB	0.019465	BB	-0.442660	10.467590AFFX-2315066	BB	0.011595	BB	-0.669805	10.581401AFFX-2315067	AB	0.001303	AB	-0.013205	11.431982AFFX-2315068	AA	0.008435	AA	0.825996	10.861217AFFX-2315069	AA	0.001571	AA	0.668768	10.201578AFFX-2315070	AB	0.057648	AB	-0.180859	10.573330AFFX-2315071	AB	0.000743	AB	-0.177327	10.455099AFFX-2315072	AA	0.088051	AA	0.746871	11.247239AFFX-2315073	AA	0.024567	AA	0.774138	10.767205AFFX-2315074	AB	0.021354	AB	0.097796	10.093736AFFX-2315075	AA	0.037346	AA	0.749082	11.703927AFFX-2315076	AB	0.008809	AB	-0.055088	11.218801!sample_table_end
