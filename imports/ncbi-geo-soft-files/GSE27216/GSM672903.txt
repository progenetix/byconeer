The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672903/suppl/GSM672903_5993_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672903/suppl/GSM672903_5993_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.014720	AA	0.547591	12.297170AFFX-2315061	BB	0.000007	BB	-0.775293	11.511625AFFX-2315062	BB	0.017731	BB	-0.694546	10.518235AFFX-2315057	NC	0.671587	AB	-0.246743	10.546143AFFX-2315058	AA	0.003900	AA	0.684704	12.175769AFFX-2315059	AB	0.000281	AB	0.223230	10.931348AFFX-2315063	AB	0.005816	AB	-0.167738	10.973516AFFX-2315064	NC	0.795330	AA	0.401241	10.090307AFFX-2315065	AB	0.011405	AB	-0.057934	10.632702AFFX-2315066	AB	0.029757	AB	0.086682	10.586194AFFX-2315067	BB	0.020918	BB	-0.626111	11.337564AFFX-2315068	AB	0.000052	AB	0.121695	10.822978AFFX-2315069	AA	0.013996	AA	0.708253	10.091580AFFX-2315070	AB	0.037918	AB	-0.143042	10.403494AFFX-2315071	BB	0.004301	BB	-0.800732	10.301954AFFX-2315072	AA	0.043169	AA	0.682731	11.212096AFFX-2315073	AB	0.005023	AB	0.096746	10.726910AFFX-2315074	NC	0.718362	BB	-0.173478	9.729113AFFX-2315075	AA	0.019538	AA	0.706789	11.689815AFFX-2315076	AA	0.019456	AA	0.626395	11.124987!sample_table_end
