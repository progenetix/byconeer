The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672876/suppl/GSM672876_9390_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672876/suppl/GSM672876_9390_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.012185	AA	0.703345	11.844813AFFX-2315061	BB	0.002587	BB	-0.799531	10.858648AFFX-2315062	AB	0.021764	AB	-0.034079	10.669394AFFX-2315057	BB	0.004984	BB	-0.625905	10.761300AFFX-2315058	AA	0.044825	AA	0.742910	11.501322AFFX-2315059	AA	0.019993	AA	0.788746	10.427340AFFX-2315063	AA	0.007444	AA	0.812544	10.611700AFFX-2315064	AB	0.012770	AB	0.298501	10.839743AFFX-2315065	AA	0.011002	AA	0.534085	10.227680AFFX-2315066	BB	0.046944	BB	-0.718692	10.647598AFFX-2315067	BB	0.034633	BB	-0.515327	11.128695AFFX-2315068	AA	0.007063	AA	0.800850	10.672325AFFX-2315069	AA	0.001871	AA	0.784787	10.506160AFFX-2315070	BB	0.011634	BB	-0.658712	10.725274AFFX-2315071	AB	0.015863	AB	-0.044120	9.712896AFFX-2315072	AA	0.006426	AA	0.553899	10.779003AFFX-2315073	AB	0.014910	AB	0.187523	10.786537AFFX-2315074	AB	0.060563	AB	-0.116346	10.381255AFFX-2315075	AA	0.098410	AA	0.742992	11.347073AFFX-2315076	BB	0.064520	BB	-0.617471	10.861474!sample_table_end
