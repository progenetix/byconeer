The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672891/suppl/GSM672891_2714_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672891/suppl/GSM672891_2714_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.040441	BB	-0.731256	11.987752AFFX-2315061	AB	0.019270	AB	0.024471	11.517492AFFX-2315062	AA	0.087761	AA	0.697405	10.128446AFFX-2315057	AB	0.106397	AB	0.026227	10.286762AFFX-2315058	AA	0.033226	AA	0.712787	12.057425AFFX-2315059	AB	0.081836	AB	0.264136	10.428802AFFX-2315063	AA	0.018364	AA	0.782516	10.541539AFFX-2315064	NC	0.704727	AA	0.402121	9.660020AFFX-2315065	AB	0.165611	AB	-0.060512	10.235754AFFX-2315066	AA	0.001905	AA	0.681417	10.231598AFFX-2315067	BB	0.191323	BB	-0.654669	10.881902AFFX-2315068	BB	0.015078	BB	-0.749352	10.534008AFFX-2315069	AB	0.029477	AB	-0.110886	9.998369AFFX-2315070	AB	0.090622	AB	-0.094016	10.201830AFFX-2315071	BB	0.007498	BB	-0.799470	10.275359AFFX-2315072	AA	0.138011	AA	0.714400	10.881616AFFX-2315073	AA	0.018317	AA	0.746808	10.457996AFFX-2315074	NC	0.702231	AB	0.130615	9.377793AFFX-2315075	AB	0.003711	AB	0.005110	11.631682AFFX-2315076	AB	0.003597	AB	-0.027259	11.206893!sample_table_end
