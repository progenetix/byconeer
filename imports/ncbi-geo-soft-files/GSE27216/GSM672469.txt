The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672469/suppl/GSM672469_6932_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672469/suppl/GSM672469_6932_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.000572	BB	-0.776426	11.899343AFFX-2315061	AB	0.001966	AB	0.086405	11.043222AFFX-2315062	AB	0.001247	AB	-0.094573	10.326035AFFX-2315057	BB	0.025963	BB	-0.632122	10.496965AFFX-2315058	AA	0.008664	AA	0.799663	12.054893AFFX-2315059	AA	0.018513	AA	0.850892	10.723807AFFX-2315063	AB	0.004929	AB	-0.174814	11.011400AFFX-2315064	BB	0.012399	BB	-0.534314	9.734053AFFX-2315065	AA	0.014944	AA	0.538598	10.199521AFFX-2315066	BB	0.007737	BB	-0.721182	10.365731AFFX-2315067	BB	0.004905	BB	-0.649647	11.084773AFFX-2315068	AA	0.004782	AA	0.876471	10.688913AFFX-2315069	AB	0.009759	AB	-0.142065	9.681083AFFX-2315070	AB	0.006263	AB	-0.010491	10.324645AFFX-2315071	AA	0.007015	AA	0.841916	10.240541AFFX-2315072	AA	0.007073	AA	0.773368	11.086842AFFX-2315073	AA	0.007153	AA	0.801289	10.775735AFFX-2315074	BB	0.003589	BB	-0.530750	9.859911AFFX-2315075	AA	0.012313	AA	0.777048	11.446205AFFX-2315076	AA	0.001438	AA	0.660730	11.184226!sample_table_end
