The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672862/suppl/GSM672862_6428_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672862/suppl/GSM672862_6428_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.020487	AA	0.642895	12.249128AFFX-2315061	AA	0.017198	AA	0.817428	11.390907AFFX-2315062	AB	0.029005	AB	-0.146589	10.731477AFFX-2315057	AB	0.062248	AB	-0.105095	10.685129AFFX-2315058	AB	0.002305	AB	0.162551	11.469981AFFX-2315059	BB	0.008019	BB	-0.625369	10.499111AFFX-2315063	BB	0.007671	BB	-0.736626	10.933219AFFX-2315064	AB	0.027996	AB	0.333570	11.004200AFFX-2315065	AB	0.047532	AB	-0.045173	10.403559AFFX-2315066	AB	0.000002	AB	0.018954	10.724477AFFX-2315067	AB	0.054147	AB	0.150125	11.234266AFFX-2315068	AA	0.004223	AA	0.787935	10.925687AFFX-2315069	BB	0.015943	BB	-0.787524	10.796832AFFX-2315070	BB	0.028910	BB	-0.665403	10.679907AFFX-2315071	BB	0.011778	BB	-0.722256	9.809715AFFX-2315072	AA	0.098245	AA	0.652540	10.792724AFFX-2315073	BB	0.013754	BB	-0.650057	10.700886AFFX-2315074	AB	0.199495	AB	0.308293	10.448181AFFX-2315075	AB	0.001559	AB	0.078839	11.713245AFFX-2315076	AB	0.013695	AB	0.000078	10.870607!sample_table_end
