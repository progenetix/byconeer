The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672417/suppl/GSM672417_2894_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672417/suppl/GSM672417_2894_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.030048	AA	0.758919	11.858732AFFX-2315061	AA	0.010458	AA	0.859870	11.056767AFFX-2315062	AB	0.144300	AB	-0.242179	10.333108AFFX-2315057	BB	0.078093	BB	-0.742486	10.716583AFFX-2315058	AB	0.047828	AB	0.277777	11.251491AFFX-2315059	AA	0.034272	AA	0.800270	10.601100AFFX-2315063	AB	0.009225	AB	-0.146751	10.746072AFFX-2315064	AB	0.035016	AB	0.272656	11.045005AFFX-2315065	BB	0.138820	BB	-0.594050	10.143111AFFX-2315066	BB	0.002507	BB	-0.654354	10.440130AFFX-2315067	AB	0.001214	AB	0.042896	11.018531AFFX-2315068	AB	0.000417	AB	0.137183	10.586308AFFX-2315069	BB	0.003081	BB	-0.808911	10.608554AFFX-2315070	BB	0.020330	BB	-0.710524	10.542946AFFX-2315071	AB	0.090394	AB	-0.244866	9.474842AFFX-2315072	AA	0.081005	AA	0.641015	10.536207AFFX-2315073	AA	0.007124	AA	0.756119	10.595486AFFX-2315074	BB	0.019175	BB	-0.637747	10.202237AFFX-2315075	BB	0.033394	BB	-0.701550	11.324633AFFX-2315076	BB	0.055650	BB	-0.629287	10.562268!sample_table_end
