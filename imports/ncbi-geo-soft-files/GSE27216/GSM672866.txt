The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672866/suppl/GSM672866_7484_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672866/suppl/GSM672866_7484_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.007091	AB	-0.067778	11.966837AFFX-2315061	AB	0.022024	AB	0.007854	11.293508AFFX-2315062	AB	0.042242	AB	-0.204994	10.538110AFFX-2315057	BB	0.042484	BB	-0.711916	10.776800AFFX-2315058	AA	0.010173	AA	0.676510	11.278221AFFX-2315059	NC	0.501234	BB	-0.367776	10.797096AFFX-2315063	AB	0.148415	AB	-0.295136	10.825574AFFX-2315064	AB	0.015897	AB	0.153836	10.944355AFFX-2315065	AB	0.041400	AB	0.026496	10.215979AFFX-2315066	BB	0.243518	BB	-0.521122	10.748368AFFX-2315067	BB	0.043678	BB	-0.496824	11.131023AFFX-2315068	BB	0.054194	BB	-0.600589	10.802513AFFX-2315069	AB	0.009922	AB	-0.210844	10.613221AFFX-2315070	BB	0.096627	BB	-0.779886	10.396290AFFX-2315071	AA	0.074157	AA	0.602229	10.025946AFFX-2315072	AA	0.051243	AA	0.625693	10.630518AFFX-2315073	AB	0.032981	AB	0.185816	10.909208AFFX-2315074	BB	0.004499	BB	-0.568169	10.314881AFFX-2315075	AA	0.030109	AA	0.646458	11.659632AFFX-2315076	BB	0.027813	BB	-0.592335	10.690108!sample_table_end
