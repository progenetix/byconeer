The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672476/suppl/GSM672476_8160_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672476/suppl/GSM672476_8160_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.004219	AA	0.690553	11.775146AFFX-2315061	AA	0.004301	AA	0.881051	11.101541AFFX-2315062	AA	0.030643	AA	0.570327	10.254898AFFX-2315057	AB	0.015495	AB	-0.002594	10.469360AFFX-2315058	AA	0.008262	AA	0.801625	11.921086AFFX-2315059	AB	0.007344	AB	0.286591	10.798630AFFX-2315063	AB	0.003211	AB	-0.111197	10.804745AFFX-2315064	AA	0.034693	AA	0.768932	10.255392AFFX-2315065	AB	0.095258	AB	-0.129845	10.163395AFFX-2315066	BB	0.035644	BB	-0.723630	10.246431AFFX-2315067	BB	0.006497	BB	-0.624322	10.909045AFFX-2315068	AB	0.001495	AB	0.144651	10.623217AFFX-2315069	AA	0.014032	AA	0.640152	9.609121AFFX-2315070	BB	0.000780	BB	-0.603143	10.426510AFFX-2315071	AB	0.006986	AB	-0.241113	10.287563AFFX-2315072	AA	0.006971	AA	0.752053	11.044711AFFX-2315073	AA	0.011359	AA	0.777503	10.425813AFFX-2315074	AB	0.012917	AB	0.130475	9.948624AFFX-2315075	AB	0.003285	AB	0.113696	11.679475AFFX-2315076	AB	0.011170	AB	-0.047170	10.987091!sample_table_end
