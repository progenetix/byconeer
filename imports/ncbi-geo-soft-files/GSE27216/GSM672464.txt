The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672464/suppl/GSM672464_4821_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672464/suppl/GSM672464_4821_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.006895	AA	0.562062	12.188769AFFX-2315061	AA	0.001297	AA	0.839509	11.604038AFFX-2315062	AA	0.017890	AA	0.579116	10.188621AFFX-2315057	AB	0.069825	AB	0.038522	10.448833AFFX-2315058	AA	0.068746	AA	0.634210	12.358231AFFX-2315059	AB	0.003567	AB	0.205284	11.030285AFFX-2315063	AA	0.014368	AA	0.801453	10.642785AFFX-2315064	BB	0.045110	BB	-0.433883	9.769098AFFX-2315065	BB	0.016985	BB	-0.401384	10.563286AFFX-2315066	BB	0.019627	BB	-0.674095	10.449574AFFX-2315067	AB	0.012169	AB	-0.086267	11.453743AFFX-2315068	AB	0.007483	AB	0.197113	10.812078AFFX-2315069	AB	0.012314	AB	-0.127085	10.692062AFFX-2315070	BB	0.020022	BB	-0.568845	10.536536AFFX-2315071	AB	0.005188	AB	-0.203909	10.554566AFFX-2315072	AA	0.097676	AA	0.542908	10.655051AFFX-2315073	AA	0.011318	AA	0.670449	10.391166AFFX-2315074	BB	0.164582	BB	-0.278511	9.900928AFFX-2315075	AB	0.016689	AB	-0.024873	11.365458AFFX-2315076	AB	0.019151	AB	-0.072737	10.998178!sample_table_end
