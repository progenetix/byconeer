The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672488/suppl/GSM672488_8994_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672488/suppl/GSM672488_8994_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.006837	AB	-0.063681	12.462265AFFX-2315061	AB	0.006477	AB	0.118282	11.563837AFFX-2315062	AA	0.064186	AA	0.725946	10.633819AFFX-2315057	AB	0.271183	AB	-0.170300	10.945651AFFX-2315058	AB	0.009396	AB	0.193773	12.353432AFFX-2315059	AA	0.032943	AA	0.858752	11.168434AFFX-2315063	AA	0.079528	AA	0.854461	11.150294AFFX-2315064	AB	0.105961	AB	0.298842	10.501417AFFX-2315065	AB	0.059361	AB	-0.034193	10.822435AFFX-2315066	BB	0.080536	BB	-0.723240	10.856356AFFX-2315067	AB	0.061506	AB	-0.010437	11.791002AFFX-2315068	AB	0.022867	AB	0.159692	11.189876AFFX-2315069	AA	0.007053	AA	0.631306	10.154031AFFX-2315070	BB	0.047915	BB	-0.596060	10.867008AFFX-2315071	AB	0.034186	AB	-0.197466	10.935333AFFX-2315072	AA	0.247332	AA	0.721108	11.701245AFFX-2315073	AB	0.053723	AB	0.045616	11.242682AFFX-2315074	BB	0.044623	BB	-0.470927	10.328658AFFX-2315075	AA	0.077907	AA	0.825391	12.069179AFFX-2315076	BB	0.070214	BB	-0.716907	11.710387!sample_table_end
