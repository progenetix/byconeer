The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672893/suppl/GSM672893_3094_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672893/suppl/GSM672893_3094_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.009005	AB	-0.040562	12.334572AFFX-2315061	AB	0.003493	AB	0.163980	11.828631AFFX-2315062	AB	0.001263	AB	-0.041105	10.492253AFFX-2315057	BB	0.087129	BB	-0.358821	10.443106AFFX-2315058	AB	0.001381	AB	0.169076	12.228770AFFX-2315059	AA	0.004902	AA	0.779374	11.045390AFFX-2315063	AA	0.009664	AA	0.797337	10.800730AFFX-2315064	AB	0.193777	AB	0.361778	10.310308AFFX-2315065	AB	0.007437	AB	0.015061	10.598534AFFX-2315066	BB	0.063753	BB	-0.744647	10.620663AFFX-2315067	BB	0.008738	BB	-0.602317	11.270473AFFX-2315068	AB	0.003359	AB	0.079097	10.895144AFFX-2315069	AB	0.008177	AB	-0.165560	10.203279AFFX-2315070	BB	0.017252	BB	-0.583516	10.604999AFFX-2315071	AB	0.006036	AB	-0.175657	10.608905AFFX-2315072	AB	0.013915	AB	0.106872	11.220888AFFX-2315073	AB	0.002877	AB	0.109185	10.686261AFFX-2315074	BB	0.026866	BB	-0.496845	9.989643AFFX-2315075	AB	0.051693	AB	-0.050674	11.856812AFFX-2315076	AA	0.003868	AA	0.568523	11.186881!sample_table_end
