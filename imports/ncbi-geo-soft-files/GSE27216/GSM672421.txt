The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672421/suppl/GSM672421_4821_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672421/suppl/GSM672421_4821_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.005069	AA	0.647536	11.989414AFFX-2315061	AB	0.002977	AB	0.140275	11.325031AFFX-2315062	AA	0.003168	AA	0.581482	10.764749AFFX-2315057	BB	0.028810	BB	-0.644460	11.189034AFFX-2315058	AA	0.020814	AA	0.718991	11.710299AFFX-2315059	BB	0.041215	BB	-0.562307	10.597483AFFX-2315063	AA	0.005835	AA	0.827356	10.881950AFFX-2315064	BB	0.007342	BB	-0.771932	10.904765AFFX-2315065	AB	0.007975	AB	-0.012578	10.615165AFFX-2315066	BB	0.036860	BB	-0.775440	10.696195AFFX-2315067	AB	0.081489	AB	0.084288	11.493825AFFX-2315068	BB	0.011842	BB	-0.730962	10.918212AFFX-2315069	AB	0.045699	AB	0.066877	10.992085AFFX-2315070	AB	0.042470	AB	-0.086881	11.171335AFFX-2315071	AB	0.037503	AB	-0.026846	10.264969AFFX-2315072	AA	0.092010	AA	0.548563	11.204226AFFX-2315073	AA	0.048586	AA	0.747594	11.160238AFFX-2315074	AB	0.009020	AB	0.053017	10.686962AFFX-2315075	AB	0.008805	AB	0.092502	11.870729AFFX-2315076	AA	0.068314	AA	0.594616	11.255400!sample_table_end
