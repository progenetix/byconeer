The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672470/suppl/GSM672470_6942_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672470/suppl/GSM672470_6942_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.025571	AA	0.625247	12.052559AFFX-2315061	AA	0.000579	AA	0.873431	10.936552AFFX-2315062	AA	0.001534	AA	0.661073	10.156308AFFX-2315057	AB	0.014645	AB	-0.056276	10.357515AFFX-2315058	AB	0.003442	AB	0.132124	12.028562AFFX-2315059	AB	0.020737	AB	0.085938	10.824186AFFX-2315063	AA	0.002780	AA	0.771083	10.539304AFFX-2315064	AB	0.113206	AB	0.316096	9.837310AFFX-2315065	AB	0.028779	AB	-0.137142	10.368587AFFX-2315066	BB	0.016432	BB	-0.736614	10.365289AFFX-2315067	BB	0.001889	BB	-0.626739	10.966945AFFX-2315068	AA	0.000610	AA	0.856621	10.731872AFFX-2315069	AB	0.358903	AB	-0.359026	9.416939AFFX-2315070	AB	0.041188	AB	-0.143752	10.125868AFFX-2315071	BB	0.005383	BB	-0.857212	10.313823AFFX-2315072	AB	0.014691	AB	-0.044386	11.212509AFFX-2315073	AB	0.014362	AB	-0.008405	10.644698AFFX-2315074	BB	0.056868	BB	-0.448760	9.614061AFFX-2315075	AA	0.007247	AA	0.692246	11.505710AFFX-2315076	AB	0.023126	AB	-0.103618	10.961515!sample_table_end
