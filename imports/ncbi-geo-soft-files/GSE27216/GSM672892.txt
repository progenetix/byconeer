The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672892/suppl/GSM672892_2714_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672892/suppl/GSM672892_2714_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.000044	AB	-0.124197	12.344671AFFX-2315061	BB	0.002938	BB	-0.750164	11.575621AFFX-2315062	AA	0.014922	AA	0.620187	10.449415AFFX-2315057	BB	0.067452	BB	-0.550322	10.706818AFFX-2315058	AA	0.006272	AA	0.671065	12.237197AFFX-2315059	AA	0.015819	AA	0.815965	10.866550AFFX-2315063	BB	0.035861	BB	-0.758130	11.207274AFFX-2315064	BB	0.018006	BB	-0.371236	10.174133AFFX-2315065	BB	0.058875	BB	-0.377834	10.661875AFFX-2315066	BB	0.007574	BB	-0.627696	10.588573AFFX-2315067	BB	0.007049	BB	-0.592003	11.242323AFFX-2315068	BB	0.001465	BB	-0.745853	10.791178AFFX-2315069	AB	0.005644	AB	-0.127583	10.223976AFFX-2315070	BB	0.025542	BB	-0.477924	10.581481AFFX-2315071	BB	0.003983	BB	-0.811592	10.348635AFFX-2315072	AA	0.021077	AA	0.663700	11.123347AFFX-2315073	BB	0.000696	BB	-0.629535	10.466794AFFX-2315074	AB	0.000465	AB	0.132537	9.966622AFFX-2315075	AB	0.059439	AB	-0.008897	11.991406AFFX-2315076	BB	0.003697	BB	-0.608278	11.153374!sample_table_end
