The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672845/suppl/GSM672845_1815_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672845/suppl/GSM672845_1815_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.004349	AA	0.623600	11.979692AFFX-2315061	AB	0.003059	AB	0.067786	11.190344AFFX-2315062	AB	0.019675	AB	-0.135549	10.750398AFFX-2315057	AA	0.002419	AA	0.552366	10.816444AFFX-2315058	AA	0.037003	AA	0.708056	11.399380AFFX-2315059	BB	0.014560	BB	-0.542492	10.353555AFFX-2315063	AB	0.005389	AB	-0.093966	11.059157AFFX-2315064	BB	0.001746	BB	-0.725924	10.851597AFFX-2315065	AA	0.013103	AA	0.416824	10.500334AFFX-2315066	BB	0.004390	BB	-0.663315	10.769066AFFX-2315067	AA	0.003305	AA	0.515523	11.241372AFFX-2315068	AB	0.005971	AB	0.211976	10.962102AFFX-2315069	AB	0.012894	AB	-0.184046	10.933703AFFX-2315070	AA	0.002092	AA	0.660652	10.782722AFFX-2315071	BB	0.005166	BB	-0.727578	9.982314AFFX-2315072	AA	0.006056	AA	0.497150	10.966261AFFX-2315073	BB	0.006840	BB	-0.659666	10.890701AFFX-2315074	AA	0.000604	AA	0.718630	10.348798AFFX-2315075	AB	0.006872	AB	0.119238	11.857455AFFX-2315076	BB	0.014618	BB	-0.537312	11.003740!sample_table_end
