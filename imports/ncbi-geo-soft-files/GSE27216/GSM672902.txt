The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672902/suppl/GSM672902_5993_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672902/suppl/GSM672902_5993_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.012725	AB	-0.176382	12.482523AFFX-2315061	BB	0.011163	BB	-0.792632	11.828639AFFX-2315062	BB	0.023026	BB	-0.687391	10.594485AFFX-2315057	AB	0.030631	AB	-0.122547	10.584783AFFX-2315058	AA	0.037624	AA	0.657608	12.369818AFFX-2315059	AB	0.001941	AB	0.205159	10.982789AFFX-2315063	AA	0.022179	AA	0.741819	10.851688AFFX-2315064	AB	0.119164	AB	0.332252	10.433997AFFX-2315065	AB	0.030014	AB	0.010290	10.719418AFFX-2315066	BB	0.015424	BB	-0.674243	10.610176AFFX-2315067	AB	0.012648	AB	0.054813	11.504219AFFX-2315068	BB	0.006718	BB	-0.753252	10.893707AFFX-2315069	AB	0.000344	AB	-0.136444	10.358269AFFX-2315070	AB	0.011648	AB	-0.019790	10.488066AFFX-2315071	BB	0.035203	BB	-0.809427	10.589271AFFX-2315072	AA	0.086241	AA	0.743471	11.282098AFFX-2315073	AA	0.037794	AA	0.795622	10.781932AFFX-2315074	BB	0.154726	BB	-0.292888	10.032179AFFX-2315075	AB	0.067106	AB	0.047755	12.113807AFFX-2315076	AA	0.015219	AA	0.611264	11.255252!sample_table_end
