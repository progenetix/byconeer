The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672908/suppl/GSM672908_7093_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672908/suppl/GSM672908_7093_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.024375	AA	0.608625	11.992702AFFX-2315061	AB	0.006356	AB	0.193664	11.129638AFFX-2315062	AB	0.001082	AB	-0.055494	10.293235AFFX-2315057	AB	0.020678	AB	-0.144050	10.482319AFFX-2315058	AA	0.026255	AA	0.741375	12.101727AFFX-2315059	BB	0.000778	BB	-0.744021	10.483121AFFX-2315063	BB	0.002447	BB	-0.803163	11.029728AFFX-2315064	BB	0.000262	BB	-0.479898	9.903699AFFX-2315065	AB	0.007064	AB	-0.059682	10.458055AFFX-2315066	BB	0.010161	BB	-0.714166	10.537691AFFX-2315067	AA	0.072131	AA	0.538681	10.884882AFFX-2315068	AA	0.002325	AA	0.843730	10.619123AFFX-2315069	AA	0.000878	AA	0.707612	9.850797AFFX-2315070	AA	0.001380	AA	0.545093	10.209261AFFX-2315071	AB	0.002545	AB	-0.203654	10.406122AFFX-2315072	AA	0.009338	AA	0.770643	11.061305AFFX-2315073	AB	0.002215	AB	0.155591	10.718015AFFX-2315074	BB	0.003055	BB	-0.507009	9.804044AFFX-2315075	BB	0.000356	BB	-0.636757	11.530725AFFX-2315076	BB	0.000935	BB	-0.705002	11.062986!sample_table_end
