The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672428/suppl/GSM672428_8135_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672428/suppl/GSM672428_8135_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.005090	AB	-0.124382	11.850259AFFX-2315061	BB	0.005746	BB	-0.767398	10.636024AFFX-2315062	AB	0.028957	AB	-0.083595	10.342117AFFX-2315057	BB	0.011232	BB	-0.569645	10.764586AFFX-2315058	AA	0.050942	AA	0.649682	11.364532AFFX-2315059	AA	0.041763	AA	0.753354	10.319468AFFX-2315063	AB	0.008165	AB	0.003094	10.609689AFFX-2315064	AB	0.004581	AB	0.186174	10.685551AFFX-2315065	AA	0.003120	AA	0.444721	10.155003AFFX-2315066	AB	0.000482	AB	0.025834	10.403091AFFX-2315067	BB	0.006784	BB	-0.487686	10.847681AFFX-2315068	AA	0.007374	AA	0.750218	10.676896AFFX-2315069	AA	0.001227	AA	0.761091	10.363756AFFX-2315070	AA	0.012738	AA	0.623779	10.407893AFFX-2315071	AB	0.010448	AB	-0.077835	9.664066AFFX-2315072	AA	0.007064	AA	0.492741	10.743990AFFX-2315073	AA	0.004204	AA	0.724573	10.625304AFFX-2315074	BB	0.001009	BB	-0.569435	10.251657AFFX-2315075	AB	0.000987	AB	0.039811	11.474039AFFX-2315076	BB	0.001526	BB	-0.489368	10.642381!sample_table_end
