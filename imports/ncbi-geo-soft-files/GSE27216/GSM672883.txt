The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672883/suppl/GSM672883_1056_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672883/suppl/GSM672883_1056_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.012207	BB	-0.768815	12.176828AFFX-2315061	AA	0.001575	AA	0.879898	11.615626AFFX-2315062	AA	0.002148	AA	0.571253	10.311093AFFX-2315057	BB	0.066568	BB	-0.542210	10.797103AFFX-2315058	AA	0.028000	AA	0.731098	12.110860AFFX-2315059	AA	0.044334	AA	0.841420	10.799732AFFX-2315063	AA	0.009336	AA	0.799933	10.710209AFFX-2315064	AA	0.093252	AA	0.721853	10.135214AFFX-2315065	AA	0.021208	AA	0.413663	10.588777AFFX-2315066	AB	0.020192	AB	0.084194	10.490038AFFX-2315067	AB	0.007425	AB	0.069171	11.389715AFFX-2315068	AA	0.031614	AA	0.792949	10.662831AFFX-2315069	AA	0.023645	AA	0.594507	10.004845AFFX-2315070	BB	0.001200	BB	-0.527547	10.651090AFFX-2315071	AB	0.007561	AB	-0.196159	10.166059AFFX-2315072	AA	0.047892	AA	0.671694	11.226221AFFX-2315073	AA	0.008960	AA	0.731761	10.465066AFFX-2315074	NC	0.975460	AB	-0.169498	9.936715AFFX-2315075	AB	0.045696	AB	0.158911	11.745619AFFX-2315076	AB	0.009081	AB	-0.036372	11.261448!sample_table_end
