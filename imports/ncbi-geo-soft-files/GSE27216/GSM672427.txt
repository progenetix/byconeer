The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672427/suppl/GSM672427_6942_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672427/suppl/GSM672427_6942_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.017789	AB	-0.165215	11.870085AFFX-2315061	AA	0.038765	AA	0.796281	11.233253AFFX-2315062	AA	0.019403	AA	0.548433	10.554281AFFX-2315057	AA	0.033164	AA	0.587791	10.809283AFFX-2315058	AA	0.168582	AA	0.594822	11.354543AFFX-2315059	AB	0.020686	AB	0.187350	10.619840AFFX-2315063	AA	0.026047	AA	0.772589	10.794452AFFX-2315064	AB	0.016131	AB	0.193504	10.977418AFFX-2315065	AA	0.056830	AA	0.621571	10.359688AFFX-2315066	BB	0.008589	BB	-0.680854	10.470590AFFX-2315067	BB	0.014502	BB	-0.559384	10.944664AFFX-2315068	AA	0.006870	AA	0.730409	10.582764AFFX-2315069	AB	0.001626	AB	-0.141676	10.653774AFFX-2315070	AB	0.001212	AB	-0.108758	10.579814AFFX-2315071	BB	0.073205	BB	-0.745813	10.130443AFFX-2315072	AA	0.029759	AA	0.465972	10.786315AFFX-2315073	AB	0.006421	AB	0.184941	10.705251AFFX-2315074	BB	0.012173	BB	-0.641627	10.297079AFFX-2315075	AA	0.140863	AA	0.595804	11.749360AFFX-2315076	AB	0.045492	AB	0.073637	10.537527!sample_table_end
