The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672915/suppl/GSM672915_7531_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672915/suppl/GSM672915_7531_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.008512	AA	0.745974	12.033563AFFX-2315061	AB	0.008683	AB	0.027055	10.964588AFFX-2315062	BB	0.059816	BB	-0.579031	10.213050AFFX-2315057	AB	0.026999	AB	0.021221	10.510740AFFX-2315058	AA	0.009658	AA	0.812241	11.973595AFFX-2315059	AB	0.060271	AB	0.368118	10.584890AFFX-2315063	AA	0.006885	AA	0.854807	10.688556AFFX-2315064	AA	0.003888	AA	0.663687	10.033959AFFX-2315065	AA	0.010802	AA	0.515285	10.169429AFFX-2315066	BB	0.001334	BB	-0.696933	10.443724AFFX-2315067	AB	0.027032	AB	-0.008779	10.973946AFFX-2315068	BB	0.013972	BB	-0.851433	10.425178AFFX-2315069	AB	0.044444	AB	0.048130	9.571289AFFX-2315070	BB	0.007313	BB	-0.614941	10.315441AFFX-2315071	BB	0.006008	BB	-0.818328	10.187946AFFX-2315072	AA	0.003075	AA	0.777205	11.161816AFFX-2315073	AA	0.006102	AA	0.819844	10.638102AFFX-2315074	BB	0.007155	BB	-0.466322	9.774040AFFX-2315075	AA	0.045129	AA	0.850751	11.487449AFFX-2315076	AB	0.013398	AB	-0.084422	11.349900!sample_table_end
