The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672426/suppl/GSM672426_6942_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672426/suppl/GSM672426_6942_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.167775	AB	-0.265684	11.712214AFFX-2315061	AB	0.019765	AB	-0.022121	10.684441AFFX-2315062	AA	0.024414	AA	0.465992	10.461780AFFX-2315057	BB	0.006601	BB	-0.649781	10.842446AFFX-2315058	AB	0.024058	AB	0.091432	10.796505AFFX-2315059	AA	0.219207	AA	0.689852	10.172807AFFX-2315063	AA	0.001474	AA	0.755881	10.573606AFFX-2315064	AA	0.002102	AA	0.798549	10.640517AFFX-2315065	AB	0.015203	AB	-0.101328	10.322380AFFX-2315066	BB	0.039288	BB	-0.590678	10.151134AFFX-2315067	AB	0.016049	AB	0.103395	10.911654AFFX-2315068	AB	0.033233	AB	0.191643	10.354132AFFX-2315069	AB	0.027245	AB	-0.119411	10.250795AFFX-2315070	AB	0.011254	AB	-0.097345	10.463065AFFX-2315071	AB	0.042387	AB	-0.186345	9.487892AFFX-2315072	BB	0.139369	BB	-0.482861	10.659966AFFX-2315073	AB	0.013950	AB	0.186968	10.368369AFFX-2315074	NC	0.523566	BB	-0.361672	10.247189AFFX-2315075	AA	0.024026	AA	0.711991	11.542333AFFX-2315076	BB	0.149164	BB	-0.367151	10.391310!sample_table_end
