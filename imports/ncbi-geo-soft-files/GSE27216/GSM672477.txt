The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672477/suppl/GSM672477_8160_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672477/suppl/GSM672477_8160_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.000130	AA	0.693225	11.874096AFFX-2315061	AB	0.002534	AB	0.139261	11.140018AFFX-2315062	AA	0.004053	AA	0.684053	10.268084AFFX-2315057	BB	0.003516	BB	-0.582296	10.520099AFFX-2315058	AA	0.011997	AA	0.734439	12.004509AFFX-2315059	AB	0.022603	AB	0.322274	10.828468AFFX-2315063	AB	0.009831	AB	-0.227922	10.969781AFFX-2315064	AB	0.046013	AB	0.342553	10.081385AFFX-2315065	BB	0.010033	BB	-0.533421	10.339852AFFX-2315066	BB	0.005368	BB	-0.708272	10.501918AFFX-2315067	BB	0.021875	BB	-0.687832	10.949683AFFX-2315068	BB	0.001098	BB	-0.812247	10.643981AFFX-2315069	AB	0.002285	AB	-0.065404	9.950001AFFX-2315070	BB	0.009237	BB	-0.642072	10.455153AFFX-2315071	BB	0.003744	BB	-0.832310	10.441036AFFX-2315072	AA	0.006760	AA	0.782497	11.129850AFFX-2315073	AA	0.003012	AA	0.782604	10.705106AFFX-2315074	BB	0.001195	BB	-0.514670	9.841565AFFX-2315075	AB	0.003280	AB	0.031481	11.667611AFFX-2315076	AB	0.003814	AB	-0.060614	11.180226!sample_table_end
