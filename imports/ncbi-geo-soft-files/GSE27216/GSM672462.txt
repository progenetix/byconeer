The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672462/suppl/GSM672462_2894_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672462/suppl/GSM672462_2894_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.006048	AA	0.751396	11.946659AFFX-2315061	AA	0.002295	AA	0.864564	11.044281AFFX-2315062	AB	0.004214	AB	-0.088063	10.469158AFFX-2315057	BB	0.121010	BB	-0.453287	10.576889AFFX-2315058	AB	0.000665	AB	0.134526	11.890190AFFX-2315059	AA	0.026805	AA	0.825812	10.653369AFFX-2315063	AB	0.004467	AB	-0.163415	10.719937AFFX-2315064	AB	0.155017	AB	0.381642	10.053773AFFX-2315065	BB	0.001834	BB	-0.504014	10.319603AFFX-2315066	BB	0.035013	BB	-0.702047	10.212708AFFX-2315067	AB	0.013010	AB	0.093024	11.324864AFFX-2315068	AB	0.007824	AB	0.147854	10.480089AFFX-2315069	BB	0.026986	BB	-0.693223	9.701764AFFX-2315070	BB	0.375897	BB	-0.435422	10.492449AFFX-2315071	AB	0.007365	AB	-0.194012	10.102609AFFX-2315072	AA	0.007085	AA	0.728010	11.095613AFFX-2315073	AA	0.002495	AA	0.796724	10.555917AFFX-2315074	BB	0.338042	BB	-0.333736	9.904748AFFX-2315075	BB	0.007954	BB	-0.689327	11.548818AFFX-2315076	BB	0.003187	BB	-0.721664	11.181122!sample_table_end
