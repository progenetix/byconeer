The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672863/suppl/GSM672863_7093_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672863/suppl/GSM672863_7093_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.008180	AA	0.596991	11.764240AFFX-2315061	AB	0.000379	AB	0.101585	10.959563AFFX-2315062	AB	0.017169	AB	-0.052797	10.400357AFFX-2315057	AB	0.003307	AB	-0.157400	10.696983AFFX-2315058	AA	0.026345	AA	0.648138	11.222320AFFX-2315059	BB	0.048193	BB	-0.478898	10.261865AFFX-2315063	BB	0.000011	BB	-0.727711	10.909209AFFX-2315064	BB	0.004054	BB	-0.713033	10.650703AFFX-2315065	AB	0.014678	AB	-0.052823	10.412706AFFX-2315066	BB	0.005226	BB	-0.679428	10.414242AFFX-2315067	AA	0.000566	AA	0.530563	11.023846AFFX-2315068	AA	0.007608	AA	0.757955	10.691350AFFX-2315069	AA	0.007736	AA	0.770833	10.595408AFFX-2315070	AA	0.004072	AA	0.588785	10.447360AFFX-2315071	AB	0.011249	AB	-0.218147	9.761682AFFX-2315072	AA	0.093268	AA	0.430444	10.600126AFFX-2315073	AB	0.033418	AB	0.275623	10.685564AFFX-2315074	BB	0.026412	BB	-0.528091	10.321393AFFX-2315075	BB	0.026597	BB	-0.556236	11.446712AFFX-2315076	BB	0.046680	BB	-0.440784	10.731360!sample_table_end
