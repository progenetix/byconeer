The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672868/suppl/GSM672868_7484_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672868/suppl/GSM672868_7484_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.029000	AB	-0.177563	11.941739AFFX-2315061	BB	0.006973	BB	-0.773913	10.622181AFFX-2315062	AB	0.046282	AB	-0.187153	10.397285AFFX-2315057	AB	0.006358	AB	-0.145318	10.644323AFFX-2315058	AA	0.045154	AA	0.714337	10.937420AFFX-2315059	AB	0.111735	AB	0.351828	10.023439AFFX-2315063	AA	0.074555	AA	0.756383	10.069687AFFX-2315064	AB	0.065120	AB	0.372559	10.519929AFFX-2315065	BB	0.283653	BB	-0.335611	10.203009AFFX-2315066	AB	0.074012	AB	0.124953	10.034286AFFX-2315067	AB	0.079312	AB	0.030693	10.705275AFFX-2315068	AB	0.019924	AB	0.225142	10.483375AFFX-2315069	BB	0.006246	BB	-0.782700	10.378897AFFX-2315070	BB	0.014562	BB	-0.616166	10.548162AFFX-2315071	AA	0.064190	AA	0.533941	9.234337AFFX-2315072	AB	0.048774	AB	-0.009007	10.462808AFFX-2315073	AB	0.023852	AB	0.118988	10.284983AFFX-2315074	BB	0.187998	BB	-0.424563	9.962214AFFX-2315075	AA	0.033835	AA	0.592831	11.515251AFFX-2315076	BB	0.027024	BB	-0.437515	10.515392!sample_table_end
