The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672412/suppl/GSM672412_2377_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672412/suppl/GSM672412_2377_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.011481	AB	-0.053534	11.994760AFFX-2315061	AB	0.003502	AB	0.139522	11.035232AFFX-2315062	AA	0.001845	AA	0.531892	10.362397AFFX-2315057	AA	0.002683	AA	0.499439	10.523541AFFX-2315058	AA	0.001885	AA	0.714749	11.239081AFFX-2315059	AA	0.010029	AA	0.764752	10.552974AFFX-2315063	AA	0.007906	AA	0.754803	10.654277AFFX-2315064	AB	0.023147	AB	0.297395	10.929196AFFX-2315065	BB	0.012427	BB	-0.501757	10.396535AFFX-2315066	BB	0.023052	BB	-0.721105	10.489157AFFX-2315067	AA	0.047931	AA	0.479303	11.146456AFFX-2315068	AB	0.014357	AB	0.094155	10.792324AFFX-2315069	AB	0.009890	AB	-0.052476	10.705666AFFX-2315070	BB	0.006663	BB	-0.639912	10.690221AFFX-2315071	AB	0.005712	AB	-0.170776	9.898677AFFX-2315072	AB	0.008236	AB	-0.083990	10.832878AFFX-2315073	BB	0.013385	BB	-0.654725	10.640470AFFX-2315074	AB	0.005398	AB	0.061753	10.403521AFFX-2315075	AB	0.002399	AB	0.112651	11.501871AFFX-2315076	AB	0.040838	AB	0.054092	10.864433!sample_table_end
