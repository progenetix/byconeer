The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672435/suppl/GSM672435_8327_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672435/suppl/GSM672435_8327_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.014288	AB	-0.010720	11.976565AFFX-2315061	BB	0.000072	BB	-0.777313	10.775781AFFX-2315062	AB	0.014641	AB	-0.133458	10.420390AFFX-2315057	AA	0.013733	AA	0.474750	10.442538AFFX-2315058	AB	0.004519	AB	0.124124	11.133841AFFX-2315059	BB	0.076259	BB	-0.473605	10.042773AFFX-2315063	AB	0.061169	AB	-0.222419	10.572757AFFX-2315064	AB	0.002214	AB	0.258541	10.655228AFFX-2315065	AB	0.032883	AB	0.009239	10.196054AFFX-2315066	BB	0.009060	BB	-0.630951	10.255108AFFX-2315067	BB	0.022660	BB	-0.498594	10.781852AFFX-2315068	AA	0.004893	AA	0.739976	10.626139AFFX-2315069	AB	0.007453	AB	-0.084801	10.433039AFFX-2315070	BB	0.016173	BB	-0.623191	10.526083AFFX-2315071	AA	0.046888	AA	0.522253	9.374592AFFX-2315072	AA	0.024281	AA	0.530972	10.570552AFFX-2315073	AB	0.015543	AB	0.108682	10.356293AFFX-2315074	AB	0.076766	AB	0.207211	10.119670AFFX-2315075	AB	0.030670	AB	-0.018743	11.665293AFFX-2315076	BB	0.024330	BB	-0.583387	10.700518!sample_table_end
