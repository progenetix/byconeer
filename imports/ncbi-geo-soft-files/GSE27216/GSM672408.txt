The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672408/suppl/GSM672408_2332_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672408/suppl/GSM672408_2332_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.209777	AB	0.158424	11.677158AFFX-2315061	BB	0.010505	BB	-0.791127	10.955677AFFX-2315062	BB	0.016236	BB	-0.662313	10.601089AFFX-2315057	AB	0.110668	AB	-0.140295	11.075433AFFX-2315058	AA	0.015695	AA	0.657098	11.185439AFFX-2315059	BB	0.005242	BB	-0.609778	10.200038AFFX-2315063	AA	0.010182	AA	0.802046	10.690881AFFX-2315064	BB	0.007154	BB	-0.761548	10.586665AFFX-2315065	AB	0.016017	AB	-0.000189	10.357086AFFX-2315066	AB	0.001872	AB	0.029792	10.437107AFFX-2315067	AB	0.007929	AB	0.037632	10.908739AFFX-2315068	AB	0.007665	AB	0.065488	10.596979AFFX-2315069	AA	0.001490	AA	0.757726	10.355523AFFX-2315070	BB	0.009093	BB	-0.614823	10.635582AFFX-2315071	AA	0.007391	AA	0.633921	9.757059AFFX-2315072	AA	0.044522	AA	0.473262	10.875350AFFX-2315073	AA	0.002207	AA	0.707987	10.552053AFFX-2315074	AB	0.002551	AB	0.019929	10.360575AFFX-2315075	AA	0.080767	AA	0.689568	11.773021AFFX-2315076	AA	0.013407	AA	0.471539	10.642455!sample_table_end
