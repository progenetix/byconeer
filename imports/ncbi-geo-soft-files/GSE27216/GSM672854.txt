The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672854/suppl/GSM672854_3519_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672854/suppl/GSM672854_3519_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.000232	AB	-0.079939	11.881561AFFX-2315061	AB	0.005635	AB	0.097300	11.107437AFFX-2315062	BB	0.005010	BB	-0.659293	10.466344AFFX-2315057	BB	0.010954	BB	-0.652065	10.774240AFFX-2315058	AA	0.007564	AA	0.669298	11.188049AFFX-2315059	BB	0.020757	BB	-0.518103	10.255460AFFX-2315063	AA	0.000614	AA	0.752189	10.488775AFFX-2315064	AB	0.004085	AB	0.273342	10.795831AFFX-2315065	AB	0.006640	AB	-0.020917	10.247808AFFX-2315066	AB	0.020556	AB	0.119558	10.419686AFFX-2315067	AB	0.020572	AB	0.092214	10.872901AFFX-2315068	AB	0.014352	AB	0.246798	10.620256AFFX-2315069	AB	0.001026	AB	-0.107050	10.594087AFFX-2315070	AB	0.033356	AB	-0.165360	10.440576AFFX-2315071	AA	0.008874	AA	0.578635	9.615614AFFX-2315072	AA	0.057868	AA	0.489316	10.509554AFFX-2315073	AB	0.015507	AB	0.051465	10.571971AFFX-2315074	BB	0.034452	BB	-0.511258	10.284723AFFX-2315075	AB	0.004390	AB	0.065510	11.572601AFFX-2315076	AA	0.014404	AA	0.496065	10.593451!sample_table_end
