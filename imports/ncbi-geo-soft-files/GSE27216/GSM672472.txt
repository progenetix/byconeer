The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672472/suppl/GSM672472_6942_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672472/suppl/GSM672472_6942_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.021659	AB	-0.130742	12.202399AFFX-2315061	AA	0.000746	AA	0.860907	10.989090AFFX-2315062	AA	0.004689	AA	0.605477	10.183545AFFX-2315057	AA	0.018841	AA	0.584879	10.277174AFFX-2315058	AA	0.012340	AA	0.753210	12.066364AFFX-2315059	AB	0.002413	AB	0.236582	10.662045AFFX-2315063	AA	0.007256	AA	0.760771	10.395816AFFX-2315064	AB	0.072452	AB	0.269087	9.848550AFFX-2315065	AA	0.049988	AA	0.376553	10.177377AFFX-2315066	BB	0.012571	BB	-0.723446	10.340839AFFX-2315067	BB	0.020326	BB	-0.686507	10.958722AFFX-2315068	AA	0.002050	AA	0.830827	10.622665AFFX-2315069	AB	0.027377	AB	-0.098253	9.490136AFFX-2315070	AB	0.018578	AB	-0.074083	10.152266AFFX-2315071	BB	0.005035	BB	-0.822428	10.202802AFFX-2315072	AA	0.001108	AA	0.756063	11.110168AFFX-2315073	AB	0.053708	AB	0.301377	10.705342AFFX-2315074	BB	0.197122	BB	-0.347860	9.805193AFFX-2315075	AA	0.026649	AA	0.676973	11.580014AFFX-2315076	AB	0.008376	AB	-0.044020	11.017313!sample_table_end
