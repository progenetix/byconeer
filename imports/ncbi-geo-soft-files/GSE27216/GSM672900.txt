The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672900/suppl/GSM672900_3921_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672900/suppl/GSM672900_3921_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.000233	AA	0.695904	11.912812AFFX-2315061	AB	0.000858	AB	0.152880	11.069072AFFX-2315062	AA	0.002694	AA	0.621403	10.206890AFFX-2315057	AB	0.028391	AB	0.022826	10.492023AFFX-2315058	AA	0.001275	AA	0.762827	11.994424AFFX-2315059	AA	0.005650	AA	0.851895	10.842390AFFX-2315063	AB	0.004642	AB	-0.130344	10.991961AFFX-2315064	AB	0.027238	AB	0.304507	9.961228AFFX-2315065	AA	0.001368	AA	0.491973	10.265060AFFX-2315066	BB	0.102362	BB	-0.637335	10.556331AFFX-2315067	AB	0.001079	AB	0.068239	11.220355AFFX-2315068	AA	0.009230	AA	0.847060	10.866810AFFX-2315069	AB	0.016541	AB	-0.176558	9.682424AFFX-2315070	AB	0.009402	AB	-0.002974	10.306183AFFX-2315071	AB	0.009750	AB	-0.076703	10.136879AFFX-2315072	AA	0.000483	AA	0.765240	11.158966AFFX-2315073	BB	0.004712	BB	-0.682557	10.567779AFFX-2315074	AA	0.002166	AA	0.604134	9.725925AFFX-2315075	AB	0.002718	AB	0.038335	11.672756AFFX-2315076	AB	0.119998	AB	0.200929	11.150002!sample_table_end
