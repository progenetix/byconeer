The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672898/suppl/GSM672898_3519_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672898/suppl/GSM672898_3519_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.014389	AB	-0.181727	12.004773AFFX-2315061	AB	0.000885	AB	0.118907	11.081617AFFX-2315062	BB	0.001863	BB	-0.679567	10.238938AFFX-2315057	BB	0.015458	BB	-0.596544	10.432467AFFX-2315058	AA	0.009918	AA	0.738645	11.882902AFFX-2315059	BB	0.000846	BB	-0.735972	10.544428AFFX-2315063	AA	0.002685	AA	0.797633	10.644150AFFX-2315064	AB	0.075291	AB	0.356406	10.113729AFFX-2315065	AB	0.082511	AB	-0.165816	10.306758AFFX-2315066	AB	0.004545	AB	-0.140052	10.277286AFFX-2315067	AB	0.003898	AB	0.079695	11.143267AFFX-2315068	AB	0.002304	AB	0.165409	10.644358AFFX-2315069	AB	0.009724	AB	-0.152348	9.700480AFFX-2315070	AB	0.000613	AB	-0.057126	10.331717AFFX-2315071	AA	0.003011	AA	0.786148	10.265371AFFX-2315072	AA	0.008025	AA	0.782980	11.117580AFFX-2315073	AB	0.000660	AB	0.139326	10.646911AFFX-2315074	BB	0.027948	BB	-0.499404	9.692617AFFX-2315075	AB	0.014722	AB	0.041197	11.862475AFFX-2315076	AA	0.002802	AA	0.624861	11.114121!sample_table_end
