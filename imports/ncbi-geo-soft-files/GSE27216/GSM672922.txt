The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672922/suppl/GSM672922_9390_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672922/suppl/GSM672922_9390_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.000291	AB	-0.115612	11.966773AFFX-2315061	AB	0.003000	AB	0.103523	10.898333AFFX-2315062	AB	0.053665	AB	-0.199719	10.205069AFFX-2315057	AB	0.007040	AB	-0.040405	10.434277AFFX-2315058	AA	0.007634	AA	0.798421	11.915325AFFX-2315059	AB	0.002788	AB	0.260765	10.684088AFFX-2315063	AA	0.000201	AA	0.808630	10.530107AFFX-2315064	AA	0.011406	AA	0.708193	10.184497AFFX-2315065	BB	0.011690	BB	-0.509545	10.244813AFFX-2315066	BB	0.006483	BB	-0.675774	10.354309AFFX-2315067	BB	0.000917	BB	-0.599657	11.004671AFFX-2315068	AA	0.009691	AA	0.835308	10.525594AFFX-2315069	AB	0.016255	AB	-0.040281	9.592738AFFX-2315070	AB	0.003868	AB	-0.064964	10.468797AFFX-2315071	BB	0.001713	BB	-0.845577	10.369786AFFX-2315072	AA	0.003708	AA	0.739081	11.164349AFFX-2315073	AA	0.011333	AA	0.807756	10.480738AFFX-2315074	AB	0.080765	AB	0.234705	9.919936AFFX-2315075	AA	0.040996	AA	0.633904	11.398732AFFX-2315076	AA	0.010489	AA	0.670059	11.285726!sample_table_end
