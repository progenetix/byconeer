The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672468/suppl/GSM672468_6932_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672468/suppl/GSM672468_6932_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.006716	AA	0.751665	11.978235AFFX-2315061	BB	0.000419	BB	-0.800908	10.881550AFFX-2315062	AB	0.061522	AB	0.104177	10.416101AFFX-2315057	AB	0.003408	AB	-0.058657	10.567837AFFX-2315058	AA	0.000393	AA	0.772760	11.986952AFFX-2315059	AB	0.013644	AB	0.302523	10.826118AFFX-2315063	AA	0.012272	AA	0.821944	10.791913AFFX-2315064	AA	0.013316	AA	0.749957	10.106460AFFX-2315065	BB	0.011699	BB	-0.502774	10.475639AFFX-2315066	BB	0.055490	BB	-0.670778	10.590765AFFX-2315067	AA	0.002327	AA	0.622577	11.272155AFFX-2315068	AA	0.000190	AA	0.845074	10.725694AFFX-2315069	AB	0.045558	AB	0.060002	9.615741AFFX-2315070	BB	0.009542	BB	-0.578847	10.464912AFFX-2315071	AA	0.001686	AA	0.807515	10.177494AFFX-2315072	AA	0.006236	AA	0.763079	11.257955AFFX-2315073	AB	0.002665	AB	0.119861	10.805366AFFX-2315074	AB	0.010717	AB	0.103314	9.969567AFFX-2315075	AB	0.006357	AB	0.118892	11.748671AFFX-2315076	AB	0.003196	AB	-0.007065	11.309094!sample_table_end
