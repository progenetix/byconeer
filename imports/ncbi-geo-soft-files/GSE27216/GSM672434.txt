The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672434/suppl/GSM672434_8327_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672434/suppl/GSM672434_8327_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.025763	BB	-0.649435	12.032476AFFX-2315061	AB	0.008968	AB	0.154604	11.108521AFFX-2315062	AA	0.027018	AA	0.535990	10.224431AFFX-2315057	AA	0.018188	AA	0.574944	10.423955AFFX-2315058	AA	0.026728	AA	0.669585	11.348490AFFX-2315059	BB	0.042426	BB	-0.485574	10.251445AFFX-2315063	AA	0.000320	AA	0.753445	10.507679AFFX-2315064	AB	0.005501	AB	0.231701	10.867861AFFX-2315065	AA	0.038185	AA	0.596616	10.126436AFFX-2315066	BB	0.023048	BB	-0.616447	10.539823AFFX-2315067	BB	0.002331	BB	-0.522683	10.937187AFFX-2315068	AA	0.010281	AA	0.801440	10.707323AFFX-2315069	AB	0.005774	AB	-0.175027	10.687794AFFX-2315070	BB	0.002422	BB	-0.675237	10.609970AFFX-2315071	AA	0.004053	AA	0.591367	9.555553AFFX-2315072	AA	0.063230	AA	0.550910	10.466304AFFX-2315073	BB	0.002459	BB	-0.604516	10.559665AFFX-2315074	AB	0.009142	AB	0.128961	10.285851AFFX-2315075	AB	0.005532	AB	0.113900	11.560020AFFX-2315076	BB	0.006219	BB	-0.472644	10.651144!sample_table_end
