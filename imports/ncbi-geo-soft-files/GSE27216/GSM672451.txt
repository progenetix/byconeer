The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672451/suppl/GSM672451_1511_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672451/suppl/GSM672451_1511_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.012765	AB	-0.168082	11.860952AFFX-2315061	BB	0.001548	BB	-0.787691	10.777668AFFX-2315062	BB	0.005991	BB	-0.704745	10.403410AFFX-2315057	BB	0.004462	BB	-0.539297	10.410466AFFX-2315058	AB	0.008867	AB	0.132994	11.691924AFFX-2315059	AA	0.003076	AA	0.804595	10.779457AFFX-2315063	BB	0.008468	BB	-0.762994	10.726127AFFX-2315064	AA	0.016115	AA	0.714492	9.982784AFFX-2315065	BB	0.089794	BB	-0.586619	10.093411AFFX-2315066	AA	0.019267	AA	0.724859	9.963844AFFX-2315067	AB	0.015922	AB	0.096837	11.073581AFFX-2315068	AA	0.014719	AA	0.798550	10.517569AFFX-2315069	AA	0.029392	AA	0.623866	9.513560AFFX-2315070	AB	0.035537	AB	-0.165835	10.244527AFFX-2315071	BB	0.007152	BB	-0.789022	10.235039AFFX-2315072	AA	0.022345	AA	0.774480	11.000982AFFX-2315073	AA	0.012297	AA	0.783581	10.422462AFFX-2315074	BB	0.103814	BB	-0.425624	9.538732AFFX-2315075	AB	0.276615	AB	-0.167263	11.040056AFFX-2315076	BB	0.003485	BB	-0.681191	10.995192!sample_table_end
