The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672917/suppl/GSM672917_7581_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672917/suppl/GSM672917_7581_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.013142	AB	-0.176961	11.897040AFFX-2315061	BB	0.030257	BB	-0.818498	11.253794AFFX-2315062	AB	0.077813	AB	-0.194176	10.089552AFFX-2315057	BB	0.126615	BB	-0.430343	10.240222AFFX-2315058	AB	0.025294	AB	0.109274	11.532849AFFX-2315059	AB	0.065965	AB	0.291009	10.313066AFFX-2315063	AB	0.096921	AB	-0.039885	10.135126AFFX-2315064	BB	0.150490	BB	-0.297882	9.399373AFFX-2315065	AB	0.089265	AB	-0.044170	10.058802AFFX-2315066	BB	0.290381	BB	-0.568959	9.894522AFFX-2315067	AB	0.091947	AB	0.072984	10.804545AFFX-2315068	AA	0.034681	AA	0.771888	10.441022AFFX-2315069	AB	0.024778	AB	-0.150418	9.559935AFFX-2315070	AB	0.019075	AB	-0.062016	10.147102AFFX-2315071	BB	0.094353	BB	-0.798083	9.766665AFFX-2315072	AB	0.038794	AB	0.125369	10.585235AFFX-2315073	AA	0.140272	AA	0.722504	9.961856AFFX-2315074	AB	0.096458	AB	0.218405	9.626576AFFX-2315075	AB	0.053458	AB	-0.001212	11.152261AFFX-2315076	AB	0.077983	AB	-0.005012	10.675803!sample_table_end
