The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672855/suppl/GSM672855_3921_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672855/suppl/GSM672855_3921_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.019229	AA	0.599220	11.861433AFFX-2315061	AA	0.026510	AA	0.777903	11.111968AFFX-2315062	AA	0.010187	AA	0.528175	10.505845AFFX-2315057	AB	0.003688	AB	-0.105530	10.762686AFFX-2315058	AA	0.132020	AA	0.639410	11.540447AFFX-2315059	AB	0.015530	AB	0.136235	10.531220AFFX-2315063	BB	0.007623	BB	-0.773579	10.909310AFFX-2315064	AB	0.011344	AB	0.141811	10.825689AFFX-2315065	AB	0.035066	AB	0.029025	10.340452AFFX-2315066	BB	0.042782	BB	-0.668158	10.654094AFFX-2315067	AA	0.202902	AA	0.389706	10.963110AFFX-2315068	AA	0.073023	AA	0.751027	10.863623AFFX-2315069	AB	0.010487	AB	-0.201437	10.685564AFFX-2315070	AB	0.042793	AB	0.034175	10.782472AFFX-2315071	BB	0.019695	BB	-0.729709	9.966947AFFX-2315072	AA	0.026074	AA	0.487983	10.851100AFFX-2315073	BB	0.069494	BB	-0.564715	10.878742AFFX-2315074	AB	0.035583	AB	-0.082218	10.403963AFFX-2315075	AA	0.010225	AA	0.681554	11.485130AFFX-2315076	AB	0.127909	AB	0.135663	10.895321!sample_table_end
