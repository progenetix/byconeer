The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672869/suppl/GSM672869_7531_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672869/suppl/GSM672869_7531_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.018142	AA	0.650130	11.933617AFFX-2315061	BB	0.009892	BB	-0.735885	10.638827AFFX-2315062	AB	0.104882	AB	-0.248768	10.580939AFFX-2315057	AB	0.036256	AB	-0.048570	10.568632AFFX-2315058	AA	0.046016	AA	0.676539	10.929712AFFX-2315059	AB	0.222305	AB	0.402793	9.932151AFFX-2315063	AB	0.054181	AB	-0.111165	10.234692AFFX-2315064	AB	0.049174	AB	0.309576	10.408334AFFX-2315065	AA	0.307000	AA	0.279535	9.960522AFFX-2315066	BB	0.091817	BB	-0.542685	10.094017AFFX-2315067	BB	0.138003	BB	-0.367693	10.711714AFFX-2315068	BB	0.009983	BB	-0.642186	10.345784AFFX-2315069	AB	0.060383	AB	-0.074412	10.089641AFFX-2315070	BB	0.232804	BB	-0.507588	10.474811AFFX-2315071	NC	0.804047	AB	-0.374402	9.103968AFFX-2315072	AA	0.289908	AA	0.405795	10.333987AFFX-2315073	AB	0.046540	AB	0.252554	10.296537AFFX-2315074	NC	0.721184	BB	-0.305706	10.018843AFFX-2315075	AA	0.033277	AA	0.593716	11.469982AFFX-2315076	AB	0.168412	AB	0.173747	10.575473!sample_table_end
