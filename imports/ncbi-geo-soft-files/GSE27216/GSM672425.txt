The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672425/suppl/GSM672425_6942_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672425/suppl/GSM672425_6942_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.000001	AA	0.637982	11.713061AFFX-2315061	AA	0.001871	AA	0.827695	10.966604AFFX-2315062	AA	0.004100	AA	0.528864	10.334823AFFX-2315057	AB	0.002604	AB	-0.148131	10.679192AFFX-2315058	AB	0.025649	AB	0.025744	10.956201AFFX-2315059	AB	0.017887	AB	0.288000	10.227463AFFX-2315063	AA	0.001328	AA	0.743656	10.491302AFFX-2315064	AB	0.022813	AB	0.338999	10.706137AFFX-2315065	AB	0.082074	AB	0.061743	10.362203AFFX-2315066	BB	0.010384	BB	-0.596140	10.388681AFFX-2315067	BB	0.086131	BB	-0.389321	10.783236AFFX-2315068	AA	0.071620	AA	0.707447	10.318268AFFX-2315069	AB	0.062156	AB	-0.160872	10.123897AFFX-2315070	AB	0.006531	AB	-0.083057	10.491844AFFX-2315071	BB	0.061339	BB	-0.697014	9.525900AFFX-2315072	AB	0.157937	AB	-0.150341	10.391132AFFX-2315073	AB	0.043063	AB	0.132907	10.172268AFFX-2315074	BB	0.065457	BB	-0.478538	10.208550AFFX-2315075	AA	0.004037	AA	0.658869	11.575419AFFX-2315076	AB	0.067929	AB	0.056982	10.482735!sample_table_end
