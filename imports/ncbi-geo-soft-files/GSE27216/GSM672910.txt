The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672910/suppl/GSM672910_7093_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672910/suppl/GSM672910_7093_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.007225	AA	0.630527	11.883096AFFX-2315061	AB	0.006513	AB	0.046243	11.113774AFFX-2315062	AA	0.007483	AA	0.700557	10.306847AFFX-2315057	AB	0.031585	AB	-0.157813	10.493582AFFX-2315058	AA	0.003780	AA	0.746470	11.934934AFFX-2315059	AB	0.002132	AB	0.250786	10.823688AFFX-2315063	AB	0.015294	AB	-0.245587	10.975437AFFX-2315064	BB	0.001162	BB	-0.471429	9.921824AFFX-2315065	AB	0.017975	AB	-0.008735	10.294829AFFX-2315066	AB	0.005561	AB	-0.036781	10.412483AFFX-2315067	AA	0.015633	AA	0.690022	11.249475AFFX-2315068	AA	0.000115	AA	0.845070	10.720527AFFX-2315069	AB	0.000267	AB	-0.094029	9.864268AFFX-2315070	AB	0.003566	AB	-0.037569	10.293821AFFX-2315071	AB	0.004815	AB	-0.167890	10.513883AFFX-2315072	AA	0.004013	AA	0.777000	11.228788AFFX-2315073	BB	0.006054	BB	-0.695408	10.633495AFFX-2315074	BB	0.003725	BB	-0.516952	9.912269AFFX-2315075	BB	0.032166	BB	-0.636439	11.793300AFFX-2315076	BB	0.017858	BB	-0.661646	11.214309!sample_table_end
