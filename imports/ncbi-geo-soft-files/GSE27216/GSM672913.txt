The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672913/suppl/GSM672913_7484_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672913/suppl/GSM672913_7484_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.000340	AB	-0.098730	11.935671AFFX-2315061	BB	0.003230	BB	-0.845040	10.842127AFFX-2315062	AB	0.014684	AB	-0.004889	10.188001AFFX-2315057	AB	0.020249	AB	-0.091966	10.339115AFFX-2315058	AA	0.008045	AA	0.790048	11.888163AFFX-2315059	AB	0.012543	AB	0.194301	10.560396AFFX-2315063	AA	0.001319	AA	0.791545	10.470840AFFX-2315064	AB	0.075778	AB	0.355327	10.036912AFFX-2315065	BB	0.035264	BB	-0.438409	10.387321AFFX-2315066	AB	0.019725	AB	-0.208390	10.245873AFFX-2315067	AB	0.006829	AB	0.082145	11.112401AFFX-2315068	AB	0.004888	AB	0.104521	10.509574AFFX-2315069	BB	0.012340	BB	-0.738542	9.722774AFFX-2315070	BB	0.012689	BB	-0.562774	10.413645AFFX-2315071	AA	0.000274	AA	0.779853	10.101595AFFX-2315072	AB	0.003477	AB	0.012100	11.219247AFFX-2315073	AB	0.005487	AB	0.163416	10.521770AFFX-2315074	BB	0.022690	BB	-0.438376	9.832094AFFX-2315075	AA	0.005636	AA	0.771911	11.566931AFFX-2315076	BB	0.002425	BB	-0.721991	11.110099!sample_table_end
