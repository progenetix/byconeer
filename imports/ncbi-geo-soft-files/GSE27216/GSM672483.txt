The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672483/suppl/GSM672483_8612_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672483/suppl/GSM672483_8612_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.000253	AB	-0.091296	11.955961AFFX-2315061	AB	0.002455	AB	0.097470	10.926031AFFX-2315062	AB	0.001633	AB	-0.034032	10.339705AFFX-2315057	BB	0.010027	BB	-0.605276	10.564141AFFX-2315058	AA	0.015551	AA	0.760922	11.821924AFFX-2315059	AB	0.016998	AB	0.212217	10.509218AFFX-2315063	AB	0.000106	AB	-0.156671	10.880652AFFX-2315064	BB	0.001022	BB	-0.465016	9.889476AFFX-2315065	AB	0.061276	AB	-0.154586	10.310731AFFX-2315066	AB	0.015867	AB	-0.130275	10.154024AFFX-2315067	BB	0.001569	BB	-0.620154	10.960592AFFX-2315068	AA	0.017395	AA	0.820175	10.463588AFFX-2315069	AA	0.009610	AA	0.681655	9.620590AFFX-2315070	BB	0.015234	BB	-0.653599	10.356239AFFX-2315071	AB	0.000288	AB	-0.162604	10.358565AFFX-2315072	AB	0.004659	AB	0.045163	11.389998AFFX-2315073	AB	0.002582	AB	0.162874	10.698438AFFX-2315074	BB	0.038795	BB	-0.542953	9.712502AFFX-2315075	AA	0.000347	AA	0.739869	11.512923AFFX-2315076	BB	0.001211	BB	-0.690768	11.034280!sample_table_end
