The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672453/suppl/GSM672453_2332_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672453/suppl/GSM672453_2332_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.017699	AB	-0.074540	12.207815AFFX-2315061	BB	0.014065	BB	-0.828523	11.133778AFFX-2315062	BB	0.012934	BB	-0.723639	10.451514AFFX-2315057	AB	0.002810	AB	-0.101586	10.539494AFFX-2315058	AA	0.014408	AA	0.757756	12.084739AFFX-2315059	BB	0.003695	BB	-0.801466	10.692398AFFX-2315063	AA	0.004350	AA	0.823499	10.693300AFFX-2315064	BB	0.003557	BB	-0.457652	9.790588AFFX-2315065	AB	0.008648	AB	-0.096115	10.448768AFFX-2315066	AB	0.011275	AB	-0.007163	10.425889AFFX-2315067	AB	0.002797	AB	0.026666	11.251476AFFX-2315068	AB	0.005951	AB	0.196208	10.840193AFFX-2315069	AA	0.003921	AA	0.714092	9.721778AFFX-2315070	BB	0.007108	BB	-0.634879	10.456748AFFX-2315071	AA	0.002591	AA	0.813559	10.144839AFFX-2315072	AA	0.007580	AA	0.751967	11.249529AFFX-2315073	AA	0.011580	AA	0.821927	10.801136AFFX-2315074	AB	0.014300	AB	0.160899	9.832219AFFX-2315075	AA	0.009361	AA	0.766554	11.635099AFFX-2315076	AA	0.012440	AA	0.637590	11.255392!sample_table_end
