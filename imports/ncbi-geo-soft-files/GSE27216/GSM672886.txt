The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672886/suppl/GSM672886_1780_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672886/suppl/GSM672886_1780_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.001234	BB	-0.722301	12.293849AFFX-2315061	AB	0.001523	AB	0.162802	11.774107AFFX-2315062	AB	0.001024	AB	-0.056489	10.538733AFFX-2315057	AB	0.141816	AB	-0.179554	10.591131AFFX-2315058	BB	0.000206	BB	-0.746051	11.826573AFFX-2315059	AB	0.001259	AB	0.244333	10.978624AFFX-2315063	AA	0.005929	AA	0.791050	10.716143AFFX-2315064	AB	0.099331	AB	0.177189	10.088448AFFX-2315065	AB	0.049221	AB	0.050029	10.470064AFFX-2315066	BB	0.029644	BB	-0.698171	10.643224AFFX-2315067	AB	0.024626	AB	-0.119940	11.434924AFFX-2315068	AA	0.010635	AA	0.804256	10.781404AFFX-2315069	AA	0.005235	AA	0.647505	10.134903AFFX-2315070	AB	0.016561	AB	-0.082776	10.380823AFFX-2315071	AB	0.000442	AB	-0.187349	10.409527AFFX-2315072	AA	0.081611	AA	0.732846	11.113719AFFX-2315073	AA	0.009505	AA	0.744638	10.690074AFFX-2315074	AB	0.125778	AB	0.161572	9.762909AFFX-2315075	AA	0.015256	AA	0.685278	11.718107AFFX-2315076	AB	0.000896	AB	0.007293	11.125620!sample_table_end
