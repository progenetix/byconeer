The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672844/suppl/GSM672844_1815_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672844/suppl/GSM672844_1815_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.004323	BB	-0.646321	12.229476AFFX-2315061	AB	0.001240	AB	0.088320	11.298629AFFX-2315062	AA	0.005013	AA	0.585250	10.782314AFFX-2315057	AA	0.001169	AA	0.522964	10.818397AFFX-2315058	AA	0.018316	AA	0.668409	11.446936AFFX-2315059	AA	0.054467	AA	0.705765	10.662992AFFX-2315063	AA	0.000394	AA	0.800812	10.809665AFFX-2315064	AA	0.028722	AA	0.792919	11.277143AFFX-2315065	AB	0.003001	AB	-0.078847	10.574886AFFX-2315066	BB	0.018119	BB	-0.677783	10.862794AFFX-2315067	BB	0.026873	BB	-0.597220	11.258988AFFX-2315068	AB	0.002608	AB	0.193201	10.937656AFFX-2315069	AB	0.017140	AB	-0.185113	10.966974AFFX-2315070	AB	0.013580	AB	-0.076876	11.041924AFFX-2315071	AB	0.001604	AB	-0.092794	9.966897AFFX-2315072	AA	0.030957	AA	0.487298	11.055790AFFX-2315073	BB	0.029090	BB	-0.586045	11.027138AFFX-2315074	AB	0.006358	AB	0.001569	10.657410AFFX-2315075	AA	0.024016	AA	0.642153	11.825315AFFX-2315076	AA	0.002380	AA	0.484978	10.933416!sample_table_end
