The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672897/suppl/GSM672897_3519_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672897/suppl/GSM672897_3519_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.005027	AB	-0.151797	11.927260AFFX-2315061	AB	0.003668	AB	0.137448	11.167645AFFX-2315062	BB	0.013838	BB	-0.736457	10.425395AFFX-2315057	AA	0.028883	AA	0.454822	10.221089AFFX-2315058	AA	0.006260	AA	0.740708	11.920481AFFX-2315059	AB	0.007500	AB	0.166249	10.684446AFFX-2315063	AB	0.000764	AB	-0.159221	10.921000AFFX-2315064	BB	0.001942	BB	-0.510561	9.958339AFFX-2315065	AB	0.042856	AB	-0.058381	10.160105AFFX-2315066	BB	0.024630	BB	-0.664836	10.248075AFFX-2315067	AB	0.004463	AB	0.048388	11.099228AFFX-2315068	AA	0.004425	AA	0.819906	10.595306AFFX-2315069	AB	0.003457	AB	-0.126989	9.756728AFFX-2315070	AB	0.003934	AB	-0.051595	10.272491AFFX-2315071	BB	0.000337	BB	-0.827077	10.361026AFFX-2315072	AA	0.013794	AA	0.767816	11.027411AFFX-2315073	AA	0.001719	AA	0.768971	10.582184AFFX-2315074	AA	0.021727	AA	0.542673	9.673136AFFX-2315075	AA	0.005509	AA	0.718361	11.572173AFFX-2315076	AA	0.004594	AA	0.676838	11.077486!sample_table_end
