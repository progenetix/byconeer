The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672437/suppl/GSM672437_8612_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672437/suppl/GSM672437_8612_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.003377	BB	-0.644004	11.865189AFFX-2315061	AA	0.012828	AA	0.854988	11.110440AFFX-2315062	AB	0.007715	AB	-0.055565	10.610252AFFX-2315057	BB	0.030241	BB	-0.663794	10.972900AFFX-2315058	AA	0.012145	AA	0.742809	11.274962AFFX-2315059	AB	0.005659	AB	0.281981	10.446722AFFX-2315063	BB	0.002875	BB	-0.718935	10.960735AFFX-2315064	BB	0.011436	BB	-0.774912	10.701303AFFX-2315065	AA	0.018876	AA	0.527956	10.304209AFFX-2315066	BB	0.019356	BB	-0.717331	10.454977AFFX-2315067	BB	0.016332	BB	-0.494987	10.803299AFFX-2315068	AB	0.006085	AB	0.219518	10.660522AFFX-2315069	AA	0.007742	AA	0.781636	10.289486AFFX-2315070	BB	0.027139	BB	-0.597413	10.693184AFFX-2315071	BB	0.019777	BB	-0.758549	9.978079AFFX-2315072	AA	0.011025	AA	0.530993	10.837015AFFX-2315073	AB	0.010009	AB	0.073388	10.637324AFFX-2315074	BB	0.039387	BB	-0.686843	10.418767AFFX-2315075	AA	0.057091	AA	0.680601	11.729379AFFX-2315076	AB	0.003734	AB	0.007207	10.656893!sample_table_end
