The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672907/suppl/GSM672907_6428_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672907/suppl/GSM672907_6428_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.011689	AA	0.610221	12.101905AFFX-2315061	AA	0.011542	AA	0.888052	11.495022AFFX-2315062	AB	0.006778	AB	-0.010551	10.481478AFFX-2315057	AB	0.009124	AB	-0.062781	10.586381AFFX-2315058	AB	0.004361	AB	0.100697	12.106457AFFX-2315059	BB	0.008319	BB	-0.709322	10.671360AFFX-2315063	BB	0.028001	BB	-0.742600	11.170812AFFX-2315064	AB	0.027637	AB	0.296981	10.182939AFFX-2315065	AB	0.055990	AB	-0.107676	10.627508AFFX-2315066	AB	0.007604	AB	-0.061376	10.560987AFFX-2315067	AB	0.019155	AB	0.080218	11.491744AFFX-2315068	AA	0.013049	AA	0.841373	10.875977AFFX-2315069	BB	0.046550	BB	-0.776190	10.084167AFFX-2315070	BB	0.046185	BB	-0.631129	10.646852AFFX-2315071	BB	0.020739	BB	-0.842211	10.492200AFFX-2315072	AA	0.033469	AA	0.682262	11.166801AFFX-2315073	BB	0.018372	BB	-0.702364	10.533836AFFX-2315074	AB	0.016296	AB	0.174543	10.026571AFFX-2315075	AB	0.072921	AB	-0.072050	11.886942AFFX-2315076	AB	0.002905	AB	-0.017205	11.206709!sample_table_end
