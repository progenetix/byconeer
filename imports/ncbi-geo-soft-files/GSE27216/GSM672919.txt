The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672919/suppl/GSM672919_7581_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672919/suppl/GSM672919_7581_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.021031	AB	-0.134347	11.744923AFFX-2315061	AB	0.016099	AB	0.144601	11.341907AFFX-2315062	AB	0.062363	AB	-0.045051	9.928908AFFX-2315057	NC	0.522946	BB	-0.339088	10.125208AFFX-2315058	AA	0.023851	AA	0.741661	11.799219AFFX-2315059	AB	0.019949	AB	0.206718	10.489698AFFX-2315063	AB	0.038467	AB	-0.032337	10.457229AFFX-2315064	AB	0.063592	AB	0.291731	9.875139AFFX-2315065	AB	0.009340	AB	-0.101795	10.325639AFFX-2315066	BB	0.092312	BB	-0.661204	10.061849AFFX-2315067	BB	0.011395	BB	-0.567718	10.901636AFFX-2315068	AB	0.010694	AB	0.169197	10.470466AFFX-2315069	AA	0.005376	AA	0.700498	9.678982AFFX-2315070	AB	0.043379	AB	-0.150292	10.131955AFFX-2315071	AB	0.019356	AB	-0.166251	9.941008AFFX-2315072	AA	0.235937	AA	0.648106	10.626438AFFX-2315073	AB	0.036088	AB	0.156345	10.220303AFFX-2315074	BB	0.018924	BB	-0.439452	9.762927AFFX-2315075	AA	0.136667	AA	0.656432	10.965209AFFX-2315076	BB	0.178181	BB	-0.540282	10.654843!sample_table_end
