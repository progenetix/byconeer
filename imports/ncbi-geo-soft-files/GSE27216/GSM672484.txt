The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672484/suppl/GSM672484_8612_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672484/suppl/GSM672484_8612_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.005619	AB	-0.041820	11.982388AFFX-2315061	AA	0.006041	AA	0.887611	10.832518AFFX-2315062	BB	0.012310	BB	-0.736259	10.343391AFFX-2315057	BB	0.006270	BB	-0.591678	10.515829AFFX-2315058	AA	0.017806	AA	0.775504	11.815932AFFX-2315059	AB	0.003227	AB	0.220670	10.652030AFFX-2315063	AB	0.004419	AB	-0.153694	10.716994AFFX-2315064	BB	0.046315	BB	-0.621169	9.640934AFFX-2315065	AB	0.017153	AB	-0.065526	10.239114AFFX-2315066	BB	0.012529	BB	-0.700468	10.293710AFFX-2315067	BB	0.002000	BB	-0.595782	11.023264AFFX-2315068	AB	0.008121	AB	0.163842	10.499487AFFX-2315069	AB	0.029097	AB	-0.006148	9.521533AFFX-2315070	AB	0.029314	AB	0.053477	10.388022AFFX-2315071	BB	0.000466	BB	-0.835853	10.349926AFFX-2315072	AA	0.000227	AA	0.752213	11.137640AFFX-2315073	AB	0.007521	AB	0.198062	10.618183AFFX-2315074	BB	0.032907	BB	-0.529266	9.709773AFFX-2315075	AA	0.000720	AA	0.716350	11.469066AFFX-2315076	AB	0.004910	AB	0.054235	11.202654!sample_table_end
