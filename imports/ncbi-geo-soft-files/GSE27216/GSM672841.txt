The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672841/suppl/GSM672841_1780_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672841/suppl/GSM672841_1780_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.003162	AB	-0.119805	12.135369AFFX-2315061	AB	0.007917	AB	0.141202	11.125186AFFX-2315062	AA	0.003591	AA	0.559739	10.748741AFFX-2315057	AB	0.034373	AB	-0.033135	10.892653AFFX-2315058	AB	0.002733	AB	0.132134	11.318913AFFX-2315059	AA	0.110785	AA	0.737848	10.414240AFFX-2315063	AB	0.023618	AB	0.121715	10.887426AFFX-2315064	AB	0.015804	AB	0.149837	10.931793AFFX-2315065	AB	0.008473	AB	-0.089703	10.548149AFFX-2315066	BB	0.000026	BB	-0.661174	10.677127AFFX-2315067	AB	0.021450	AB	0.115624	11.222187AFFX-2315068	AA	0.019389	AA	0.811361	10.685125AFFX-2315069	AB	0.003837	AB	-0.142961	10.625205AFFX-2315070	AB	0.004377	AB	-0.094459	10.828795AFFX-2315071	AA	0.024013	AA	0.689037	9.579522AFFX-2315072	AB	0.001970	AB	-0.087571	10.992245AFFX-2315073	AA	0.004100	AA	0.756574	10.853685AFFX-2315074	AA	0.016451	AA	0.730640	10.479565AFFX-2315075	AA	0.109408	AA	0.609638	11.918688AFFX-2315076	AB	0.035870	AB	0.091926	11.090104!sample_table_end
