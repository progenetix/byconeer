The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672407/suppl/GSM672407_2332_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672407/suppl/GSM672407_2332_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.071658	BB	-0.682232	11.582938AFFX-2315061	BB	0.018279	BB	-0.747731	10.535889AFFX-2315062	AB	0.004649	AB	-0.062137	10.589644AFFX-2315057	AB	0.096249	AB	0.029822	10.970152AFFX-2315058	AA	0.036010	AA	0.706489	10.962056AFFX-2315059	AB	0.016154	AB	0.223576	10.196656AFFX-2315063	AA	0.000142	AA	0.769437	10.536662AFFX-2315064	AB	0.014215	AB	0.245185	10.521152AFFX-2315065	AB	0.001072	AB	-0.063302	10.300834AFFX-2315066	BB	0.026156	BB	-0.633341	10.164715AFFX-2315067	AB	0.015929	AB	-0.009587	10.926171AFFX-2315068	BB	0.024179	BB	-0.742984	10.431435AFFX-2315069	AA	0.030217	AA	0.657528	10.263426AFFX-2315070	BB	0.098203	BB	-0.542842	10.580486AFFX-2315071	AB	0.001544	AB	-0.133782	9.822186AFFX-2315072	AB	0.010107	AB	-0.026129	10.873743AFFX-2315073	AA	0.021919	AA	0.736889	10.414869AFFX-2315074	AB	0.006414	AB	0.099618	10.224489AFFX-2315075	AA	0.035620	AA	0.724876	11.593691AFFX-2315076	AB	0.204322	AB	-0.146082	10.631885!sample_table_end
