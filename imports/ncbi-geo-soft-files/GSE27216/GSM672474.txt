The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672474/suppl/GSM672474_8135_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672474/suppl/GSM672474_8135_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.001735	AA	0.657986	11.866220AFFX-2315061	BB	0.013231	BB	-0.812382	11.113362AFFX-2315062	AB	0.026462	AB	0.001363	10.118693AFFX-2315057	BB	0.033629	BB	-0.489915	10.311913AFFX-2315058	AA	0.009221	AA	0.744478	11.872382AFFX-2315059	AB	0.020318	AB	0.297755	10.553017AFFX-2315063	AB	0.012120	AB	-0.167268	10.633126AFFX-2315064	AB	0.155284	AB	0.282969	9.749003AFFX-2315065	AA	0.031956	AA	0.526480	10.056705AFFX-2315066	AA	0.012255	AA	0.736178	10.036181AFFX-2315067	BB	0.023447	BB	-0.567436	10.811731AFFX-2315068	AA	0.028403	AA	0.829984	10.399135AFFX-2315069	AA	0.003052	AA	0.717819	9.744580AFFX-2315070	AA	0.019738	AA	0.534597	10.033269AFFX-2315071	AB	0.019384	AB	-0.119320	9.935132AFFX-2315072	AA	0.061206	AA	0.709142	10.847237AFFX-2315073	AA	0.042865	AA	0.767071	10.248083AFFX-2315074	BB	0.233652	BB	-0.329679	9.546687AFFX-2315075	AB	0.001213	AB	0.053937	11.522269AFFX-2315076	BB	0.036391	BB	-0.684448	10.777344!sample_table_end
