The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672875/suppl/GSM672875_9390_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672875/suppl/GSM672875_9390_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.002747	AA	0.655640	11.795473AFFX-2315061	BB	0.003183	BB	-0.812408	10.837852AFFX-2315062	AB	0.106102	AB	0.091731	10.565124AFFX-2315057	AB	0.021062	AB	-0.098084	10.581045AFFX-2315058	AA	0.003907	AA	0.702061	11.284594AFFX-2315059	AB	0.000195	AB	0.212386	10.405584AFFX-2315063	AA	0.000483	AA	0.775461	10.541830AFFX-2315064	AA	0.003295	AA	0.808568	10.769778AFFX-2315065	AB	0.030120	AB	-0.094506	10.195591AFFX-2315066	BB	0.017513	BB	-0.701353	10.506595AFFX-2315067	BB	0.012406	BB	-0.477752	11.005346AFFX-2315068	AA	0.008184	AA	0.784098	10.709581AFFX-2315069	AB	0.009998	AB	-0.210552	10.619959AFFX-2315070	BB	0.032722	BB	-0.737046	10.715723AFFX-2315071	AB	0.088986	AB	-0.297122	9.689113AFFX-2315072	AA	0.005444	AA	0.556184	10.748831AFFX-2315073	AB	0.006662	AB	0.114542	10.711317AFFX-2315074	AA	0.001010	AA	0.667529	10.135071AFFX-2315075	AA	0.015504	AA	0.674512	11.442737AFFX-2315076	AB	0.006474	AB	0.032073	10.764673!sample_table_end
