The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672925/suppl/GSM672925_9609_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672925/suppl/GSM672925_9609_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.000799	AB	-0.103100	12.387873AFFX-2315061	BB	0.003486	BB	-0.763929	11.331169AFFX-2315062	AB	0.045684	AB	-0.122446	10.812554AFFX-2315057	BB	0.072598	BB	-0.542177	10.827944AFFX-2315058	AB	0.010793	AB	0.217382	12.302628AFFX-2315059	BB	0.005811	BB	-0.705219	10.924443AFFX-2315063	AA	0.039114	AA	0.791118	10.991798AFFX-2315064	AA	0.123889	AA	0.653943	10.476520AFFX-2315065	AA	0.031391	AA	0.479804	10.688925AFFX-2315066	BB	0.075282	BB	-0.695881	10.856930AFFX-2315067	AB	0.024500	AB	0.013292	11.618208AFFX-2315068	AA	0.015455	AA	0.826476	11.077259AFFX-2315069	AB	0.020866	AB	-0.187785	10.113893AFFX-2315070	AB	0.023101	AB	-0.083585	10.705513AFFX-2315071	AB	0.018650	AB	-0.171151	10.802883AFFX-2315072	AA	0.153927	AA	0.775248	11.549305AFFX-2315073	AA	0.077634	AA	0.774776	11.148206AFFX-2315074	BB	0.013557	BB	-0.464512	10.181649AFFX-2315075	AB	0.085556	AB	0.110181	12.162311AFFX-2315076	AB	0.101071	AB	0.015094	11.659509!sample_table_end
