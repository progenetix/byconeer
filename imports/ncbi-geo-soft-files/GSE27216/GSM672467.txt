The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672467/suppl/GSM672467_6932_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672467/suppl/GSM672467_6932_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.006641	AB	-0.075947	12.104568AFFX-2315061	BB	0.003159	BB	-0.845125	10.926997AFFX-2315062	AA	0.012430	AA	0.653023	10.352755AFFX-2315057	AB	0.005596	AB	-0.063504	10.599310AFFX-2315058	AA	0.002333	AA	0.785423	11.938138AFFX-2315059	AB	0.002015	AB	0.237760	10.843570AFFX-2315063	AB	0.006124	AB	-0.216429	10.938854AFFX-2315064	AB	0.002531	AB	0.259702	10.070544AFFX-2315065	AB	0.037315	AB	-0.145494	10.430614AFFX-2315066	BB	0.040499	BB	-0.783550	10.520933AFFX-2315067	AB	0.028422	AB	0.071248	11.443846AFFX-2315068	AA	0.006323	AA	0.855575	10.847898AFFX-2315069	AA	0.053737	AA	0.574952	9.646255AFFX-2315070	BB	0.005269	BB	-0.623076	10.465560AFFX-2315071	AA	0.006107	AA	0.818451	10.316619AFFX-2315072	AA	0.000889	AA	0.746807	11.144773AFFX-2315073	AB	0.001451	AB	0.126790	10.760585AFFX-2315074	AB	0.008704	AB	0.049101	9.945487AFFX-2315075	AB	0.006765	AB	0.130402	11.720641AFFX-2315076	AA	0.006961	AA	0.639761	11.220451!sample_table_end
