The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672838/suppl/GSM672838_1056_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672838/suppl/GSM672838_1056_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.005017	AA	0.622996	11.973361AFFX-2315061	BB	0.003143	BB	-0.759350	11.070850AFFX-2315062	AA	0.014591	AA	0.660037	10.707408AFFX-2315057	AB	0.014066	AB	-0.071634	10.970593AFFX-2315058	AA	0.055989	AA	0.701503	11.346805AFFX-2315059	AB	0.006902	AB	0.282592	10.514667AFFX-2315063	AA	0.003739	AA	0.821413	10.856293AFFX-2315064	AB	0.005579	AB	0.281557	11.075366AFFX-2315065	AA	0.204412	AA	0.314866	10.448940AFFX-2315066	BB	0.004793	BB	-0.629417	10.706254AFFX-2315067	BB	0.020121	BB	-0.586128	11.182092AFFX-2315068	AB	0.015922	AB	0.272462	10.888079AFFX-2315069	AB	0.002811	AB	-0.186244	10.691162AFFX-2315070	AA	0.004655	AA	0.668061	10.827402AFFX-2315071	BB	0.007129	BB	-0.713948	9.826789AFFX-2315072	AA	0.027704	AA	0.491519	11.054665AFFX-2315073	AA	0.013796	AA	0.786276	10.869493AFFX-2315074	BB	0.021741	BB	-0.628651	10.700176AFFX-2315075	AA	0.002706	AA	0.682673	11.836735AFFX-2315076	AB	0.059516	AB	0.090492	11.157985!sample_table_end
