The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672438/suppl/GSM672438_8612_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672438/suppl/GSM672438_8612_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.001501	AB	-0.061645	11.824529AFFX-2315061	AB	0.008193	AB	0.187486	10.984462AFFX-2315062	AB	0.036440	AB	-0.150826	10.681905AFFX-2315057	BB	0.011455	BB	-0.655079	10.887115AFFX-2315058	AA	0.023002	AA	0.747620	11.111181AFFX-2315059	AB	0.023923	AB	0.282372	10.189269AFFX-2315063	AB	0.004571	AB	-0.096536	10.608695AFFX-2315064	BB	0.022440	BB	-0.581664	10.592954AFFX-2315065	AB	0.016450	AB	0.003133	10.247294AFFX-2315066	AB	0.001858	AB	0.023870	10.296669AFFX-2315067	BB	0.118416	BB	-0.373446	10.760414AFFX-2315068	AA	0.239593	AA	0.599172	10.324280AFFX-2315069	AA	0.050299	AA	0.631290	10.214618AFFX-2315070	BB	0.104950	BB	-0.573816	10.412363AFFX-2315071	AB	0.102013	AB	-0.280178	9.562620AFFX-2315072	AB	0.033870	AB	0.065654	10.686373AFFX-2315073	AB	0.025544	AB	0.181264	10.285221AFFX-2315074	BB	0.004098	BB	-0.578712	10.328202AFFX-2315075	AA	0.019567	AA	0.607365	11.535336AFFX-2315076	BB	0.060813	BB	-0.405800	10.625232!sample_table_end
