The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672842/suppl/GSM672842_1780_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672842/suppl/GSM672842_1780_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.006689	BB	-0.636940	12.227242AFFX-2315061	AB	0.003201	AB	0.158212	11.292132AFFX-2315062	AB	0.003058	AB	-0.055460	10.891297AFFX-2315057	AB	0.003751	AB	-0.117365	10.894144AFFX-2315058	BB	0.001647	BB	-0.666933	11.011794AFFX-2315059	AB	0.000343	AB	0.210282	10.591325AFFX-2315063	AA	0.000781	AA	0.803818	10.827934AFFX-2315064	AB	0.002166	AB	0.194559	11.060445AFFX-2315065	AB	0.019185	AB	-0.082431	10.490298AFFX-2315066	BB	0.003413	BB	-0.689139	10.725138AFFX-2315067	AB	0.011324	AB	-0.035489	11.237322AFFX-2315068	AA	0.000528	AA	0.793599	10.871353AFFX-2315069	AA	0.005879	AA	0.792869	10.731816AFFX-2315070	AB	0.003414	AB	-0.128725	10.965378AFFX-2315071	AB	0.001066	AB	-0.084528	9.933936AFFX-2315072	AA	0.030180	AA	0.515604	10.811870AFFX-2315073	AA	0.003464	AA	0.757759	10.953475AFFX-2315074	AB	0.003062	AB	0.044698	10.623389AFFX-2315075	AA	0.002593	AA	0.690398	11.756647AFFX-2315076	AB	0.008704	AB	-0.004819	11.013714!sample_table_end
