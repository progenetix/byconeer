The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672411/suppl/GSM672411_2377_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672411/suppl/GSM672411_2377_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.004034	AB	-0.028776	11.910451AFFX-2315061	BB	0.009199	BB	-0.824115	10.925518AFFX-2315062	AB	0.068561	AB	0.063707	10.581904AFFX-2315057	AA	0.009864	AA	0.592390	10.568746AFFX-2315058	AA	0.019818	AA	0.657173	11.246511AFFX-2315059	AA	0.001835	AA	0.745533	10.447079AFFX-2315063	AA	0.019900	AA	0.813987	10.766833AFFX-2315064	AB	0.013835	AB	0.216051	10.957616AFFX-2315065	AB	0.076421	AB	-0.151153	10.362679AFFX-2315066	BB	0.022561	BB	-0.724672	10.455749AFFX-2315067	AB	0.066587	AB	-0.083102	11.132873AFFX-2315068	AB	0.000467	AB	0.166061	10.589047AFFX-2315069	AB	0.008814	AB	-0.048261	10.658784AFFX-2315070	BB	0.031880	BB	-0.728692	10.736832AFFX-2315071	BB	0.017699	BB	-0.766076	9.962186AFFX-2315072	AB	0.013636	AB	-0.084534	10.625629AFFX-2315073	AA	0.028634	AA	0.768589	10.713541AFFX-2315074	BB	0.021429	BB	-0.662756	10.311221AFFX-2315075	AA	0.014350	AA	0.672674	11.620031AFFX-2315076	BB	0.029422	BB	-0.595951	10.635110!sample_table_end
