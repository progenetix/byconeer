The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672436/suppl/GSM672436_8327_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672436/suppl/GSM672436_8327_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.003708	AB	-0.115646	11.893269AFFX-2315061	AA	0.000160	AA	0.811385	10.916131AFFX-2315062	AA	0.022504	AA	0.485544	10.501929AFFX-2315057	AB	0.001802	AB	-0.151196	10.708028AFFX-2315058	AA	0.001178	AA	0.706080	11.169777AFFX-2315059	AB	0.000599	AB	0.220730	10.355936AFFX-2315063	AA	0.001516	AA	0.741886	10.504580AFFX-2315064	AB	0.016829	AB	0.323683	10.768268AFFX-2315065	AA	0.029875	AA	0.522637	10.037415AFFX-2315066	BB	0.013227	BB	-0.595029	10.421649AFFX-2315067	BB	0.020952	BB	-0.444991	10.936265AFFX-2315068	AA	0.002260	AA	0.781914	10.653897AFFX-2315069	BB	0.004725	BB	-0.811058	10.637667AFFX-2315070	BB	0.017508	BB	-0.621858	10.522734AFFX-2315071	AA	0.004416	AA	0.590520	9.594388AFFX-2315072	AA	0.018350	AA	0.499061	10.612306AFFX-2315073	AB	0.003947	AB	0.136749	10.686949AFFX-2315074	AB	0.002593	AB	0.078166	10.355400AFFX-2315075	AA	0.004462	AA	0.668973	11.569167AFFX-2315076	BB	0.035069	BB	-0.575161	10.794288!sample_table_end
