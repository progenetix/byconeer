The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672857/suppl/GSM672857_5993_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672857/suppl/GSM672857_5993_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.011763	AB	-0.099065	12.281739AFFX-2315061	BB	0.001586	BB	-0.767883	11.088323AFFX-2315062	BB	0.014476	BB	-0.646534	10.657687AFFX-2315057	AB	0.017070	AB	-0.203961	10.882646AFFX-2315058	AA	0.014797	AA	0.731657	11.593558AFFX-2315059	AB	0.001258	AB	0.265328	10.586004AFFX-2315063	AA	0.021875	AA	0.763788	10.576756AFFX-2315064	AB	0.018175	AB	0.165038	10.888238AFFX-2315065	AB	0.050709	AB	-0.130522	10.507559AFFX-2315066	BB	0.033839	BB	-0.627087	10.462047AFFX-2315067	AB	0.044786	AB	0.041542	11.035107AFFX-2315068	BB	0.001154	BB	-0.637200	10.799949AFFX-2315069	AB	0.001032	AB	-0.119272	10.692410AFFX-2315070	AB	0.033855	AB	-0.112997	10.680845AFFX-2315071	BB	0.003474	BB	-0.740964	9.932590AFFX-2315072	AA	0.030258	AA	0.467744	10.902580AFFX-2315073	AA	0.015282	AA	0.710444	10.800433AFFX-2315074	BB	0.055766	BB	-0.643743	10.398966AFFX-2315075	AB	0.018209	AB	0.005189	11.815447AFFX-2315076	AA	0.057532	AA	0.429744	10.793116!sample_table_end
