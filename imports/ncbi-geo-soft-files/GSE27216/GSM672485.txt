The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672485/suppl/GSM672485_8960_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672485/suppl/GSM672485_8960_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.002573	AB	-0.078942	12.381701AFFX-2315061	AA	0.002257	AA	0.843379	11.673607AFFX-2315062	BB	0.010234	BB	-0.676922	10.475340AFFX-2315057	BB	0.061442	BB	-0.540398	10.664239AFFX-2315058	AA	0.035828	AA	0.642444	12.267638AFFX-2315059	AB	0.005552	AB	0.171919	10.982856AFFX-2315063	AB	0.045120	AB	-0.256908	11.138184AFFX-2315064	AA	0.049052	AA	0.655779	10.348089AFFX-2315065	AB	0.033560	AB	0.039920	10.667225AFFX-2315066	BB	0.018121	BB	-0.641975	10.654975AFFX-2315067	BB	0.016360	BB	-0.618788	11.299781AFFX-2315068	AA	0.009166	AA	0.808912	10.801701AFFX-2315069	AB	0.017127	AB	-0.051481	10.179403AFFX-2315070	AB	0.035778	AB	-0.160112	10.489944AFFX-2315071	AA	0.006216	AA	0.757693	10.302936AFFX-2315072	AA	0.055255	AA	0.698500	11.249400AFFX-2315073	AA	0.003895	AA	0.694106	10.576928AFFX-2315074	AB	0.080783	AB	0.219026	9.931917AFFX-2315075	AB	0.044649	AB	0.130575	11.881201AFFX-2315076	AB	0.028103	AB	-0.110573	11.210585!sample_table_end
