The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672429/suppl/GSM672429_8135_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672429/suppl/GSM672429_8135_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.025180	AA	0.591547	11.875184AFFX-2315061	BB	0.012234	BB	-0.750623	10.902865AFFX-2315062	AB	0.027790	AB	-0.144892	10.661433AFFX-2315057	BB	0.327916	BB	-0.450532	10.852147AFFX-2315058	AA	0.007412	AA	0.694734	11.306709AFFX-2315059	AB	0.007813	AB	0.286167	10.303855AFFX-2315063	AB	0.012110	AB	-0.030475	10.486838AFFX-2315064	AB	0.007216	AB	0.250448	10.581313AFFX-2315065	AA	0.134997	AA	0.345181	10.313989AFFX-2315066	AA	0.021832	AA	0.643421	10.124992AFFX-2315067	BB	0.012320	BB	-0.453305	10.903823AFFX-2315068	AA	0.031998	AA	0.721052	10.708613AFFX-2315069	AA	0.015186	AA	0.718247	10.205217AFFX-2315070	AA	0.165968	AA	0.433442	10.551315AFFX-2315071	AB	0.009072	AB	-0.165311	9.626163AFFX-2315072	AA	0.186457	AA	0.399793	10.880923AFFX-2315073	AA	0.012908	AA	0.693014	10.486226AFFX-2315074	NC	0.529151	BB	-0.351719	10.181115AFFX-2315075	AB	0.019469	AB	0.040277	11.678622AFFX-2315076	BB	0.068624	BB	-0.440162	10.779966!sample_table_end
