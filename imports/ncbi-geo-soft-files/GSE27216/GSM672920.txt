The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672920/suppl/GSM672920_9390_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672920/suppl/GSM672920_9390_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.005145	AA	0.746568	11.917332AFFX-2315061	BB	0.000804	BB	-0.821558	10.817422AFFX-2315062	AB	0.001926	AB	-0.032420	10.371127AFFX-2315057	AB	0.009382	AB	-0.031966	10.589283AFFX-2315058	AA	0.000762	AA	0.779509	11.953051AFFX-2315059	AB	0.001460	AB	0.257822	10.727682AFFX-2315063	AA	0.003164	AA	0.817083	10.671762AFFX-2315064	AA	0.003109	AA	0.703233	10.129289AFFX-2315065	AB	0.002368	AB	-0.076386	10.419969AFFX-2315066	BB	0.010918	BB	-0.702751	10.528800AFFX-2315067	BB	0.002958	BB	-0.630352	11.084362AFFX-2315068	AA	0.004508	AA	0.853299	10.602886AFFX-2315069	AB	0.001381	AB	-0.103358	9.793468AFFX-2315070	BB	0.028543	BB	-0.595371	10.574431AFFX-2315071	AB	0.000612	AB	-0.187231	10.354421AFFX-2315072	AA	0.008837	AA	0.758449	11.270750AFFX-2315073	AB	0.007085	AB	0.020320	10.726954AFFX-2315074	AA	0.012117	AA	0.624389	9.881996AFFX-2315075	AA	0.008907	AA	0.784969	11.562878AFFX-2315076	AB	0.005762	AB	-0.033434	11.333264!sample_table_end
