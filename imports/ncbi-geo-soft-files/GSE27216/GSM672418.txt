The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672418/suppl/GSM672418_2894_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672418/suppl/GSM672418_2894_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.004877	AA	0.656999	11.623797AFFX-2315061	BB	0.005638	BB	-0.755998	10.647243AFFX-2315062	BB	0.006905	BB	-0.638827	10.409354AFFX-2315057	AB	0.030019	AB	-0.203501	10.662649AFFX-2315058	AA	0.015525	AA	0.672176	11.062058AFFX-2315059	BB	0.011507	BB	-0.594345	10.145867AFFX-2315063	AB	0.000096	AB	-0.072524	10.719254AFFX-2315064	AA	0.006198	AA	0.838407	10.777095AFFX-2315065	AA	0.040625	AA	0.457222	9.992607AFFX-2315066	BB	0.043777	BB	-0.724940	10.189833AFFX-2315067	BB	0.104254	BB	-0.586591	10.674540AFFX-2315068	AA	0.007002	AA	0.803409	10.627402AFFX-2315069	AB	0.002752	AB	-0.106974	10.666262AFFX-2315070	BB	0.035957	BB	-0.723063	10.493500AFFX-2315071	AA	0.037961	AA	0.706431	9.404163AFFX-2315072	AA	0.062636	AA	0.562114	10.472082AFFX-2315073	AB	0.002228	AB	0.196347	10.585985AFFX-2315074	BB	0.032635	BB	-0.653360	10.170864AFFX-2315075	AA	0.025678	AA	0.710789	11.503505AFFX-2315076	BB	0.028899	BB	-0.595691	10.649384!sample_table_end
