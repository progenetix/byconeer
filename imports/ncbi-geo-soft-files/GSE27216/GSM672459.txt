The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672459/suppl/GSM672459_2569_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672459/suppl/GSM672459_2569_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.006579	AB	-0.102559	12.496901AFFX-2315061	BB	0.000947	BB	-0.771607	11.418016AFFX-2315062	AB	0.062177	AB	-0.142198	10.845644AFFX-2315057	BB	0.135249	BB	-0.486002	10.955101AFFX-2315058	AA	0.022412	AA	0.725402	12.406156AFFX-2315059	BB	0.015425	BB	-0.760634	10.931927AFFX-2315063	AB	0.034302	AB	-0.112246	11.350163AFFX-2315064	AA	0.111573	AA	0.754786	10.463574AFFX-2315065	BB	0.017520	BB	-0.487717	10.752833AFFX-2315066	AB	0.019004	AB	0.046018	10.602983AFFX-2315067	AB	0.027688	AB	0.008403	11.637259AFFX-2315068	AB	0.015271	AB	0.189848	11.051393AFFX-2315069	AB	0.023148	AB	-0.134316	10.045092AFFX-2315070	BB	0.062642	BB	-0.510470	10.838271AFFX-2315071	AB	0.017195	AB	-0.187421	10.765717AFFX-2315072	AA	0.148163	AA	0.744795	11.532896AFFX-2315073	AA	0.076330	AA	0.790925	11.149834AFFX-2315074	BB	0.019336	BB	-0.409000	10.164453AFFX-2315075	AA	0.064309	AA	0.732098	12.031678AFFX-2315076	AB	0.058993	AB	-0.025694	11.542543!sample_table_end
