The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672874/suppl/GSM672874_7581_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672874/suppl/GSM672874_7581_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.000626	AB	-0.091987	11.862219AFFX-2315061	AB	0.001649	AB	0.091419	10.825930AFFX-2315062	AB	0.016774	AB	-0.152306	10.438890AFFX-2315057	BB	0.049638	BB	-0.530753	10.734362AFFX-2315058	AA	0.000595	AA	0.691378	11.207409AFFX-2315059	AB	0.017183	AB	0.309676	10.266171AFFX-2315063	AB	0.003399	AB	-0.049308	10.612047AFFX-2315064	AB	0.000970	AB	0.249522	10.676837AFFX-2315065	AB	0.009705	AB	-0.012917	10.352594AFFX-2315066	BB	0.001595	BB	-0.637174	10.326574AFFX-2315067	BB	0.019949	BB	-0.479668	10.786387AFFX-2315068	AB	0.006031	AB	0.075492	10.609340AFFX-2315069	AA	0.000479	AA	0.756186	10.387330AFFX-2315070	AB	0.004514	AB	-0.032695	10.579803AFFX-2315071	AB	0.008907	AB	-0.176231	9.641665AFFX-2315072	AA	0.012039	AA	0.490915	10.663419AFFX-2315073	AB	0.006146	AB	0.212143	10.503028AFFX-2315074	BB	0.127301	BB	-0.449185	10.236775AFFX-2315075	AA	0.033912	AA	0.671843	11.383023AFFX-2315076	BB	0.015864	BB	-0.563330	10.598466!sample_table_end
