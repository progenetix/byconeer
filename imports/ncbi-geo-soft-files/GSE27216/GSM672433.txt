The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672433/suppl/GSM672433_8160_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672433/suppl/GSM672433_8160_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.015076	AB	-0.151746	11.818424AFFX-2315061	AB	0.001874	AB	0.147014	10.861112AFFX-2315062	AB	0.150881	AB	0.113829	10.662218AFFX-2315057	AB	0.009288	AB	-0.105531	10.808662AFFX-2315058	AA	0.002993	AA	0.695638	11.267344AFFX-2315059	AA	0.016975	AA	0.764935	10.382976AFFX-2315063	BB	0.004089	BB	-0.733439	10.831429AFFX-2315064	AB	0.009802	AB	0.254154	10.898677AFFX-2315065	AA	0.040863	AA	0.486259	10.384668AFFX-2315066	BB	0.012354	BB	-0.622331	10.496520AFFX-2315067	BB	0.026691	BB	-0.549171	11.114557AFFX-2315068	AB	0.005336	AB	0.212237	10.603759AFFX-2315069	AA	0.002438	AA	0.760010	10.336814AFFX-2315070	BB	0.059297	BB	-0.676956	10.869751AFFX-2315071	AB	0.017077	AB	-0.042201	9.686014AFFX-2315072	AA	0.060574	AA	0.469691	10.909379AFFX-2315073	AB	0.014459	AB	0.078455	10.741423AFFX-2315074	AB	0.014381	AB	0.060332	10.470524AFFX-2315075	AA	0.037781	AA	0.695408	11.678881AFFX-2315076	BB	0.054719	BB	-0.499210	10.846370!sample_table_end
