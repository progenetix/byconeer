The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672416/suppl/GSM672416_2894_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672416/suppl/GSM672416_2894_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.028426	AA	0.757052	11.799329AFFX-2315061	AB	0.002981	AB	0.121393	10.785599AFFX-2315062	BB	0.120904	BB	-0.771488	10.250001AFFX-2315057	AB	0.441954	AB	-0.286890	10.302748AFFX-2315058	AA	0.094711	AA	0.818527	11.046290AFFX-2315059	AB	0.289232	AB	0.494123	10.446193AFFX-2315063	AB	0.036994	AB	-0.062156	10.279685AFFX-2315064	AB	0.020793	AB	0.324868	10.602060AFFX-2315065	NC	0.602245	AB	-0.041483	9.503686AFFX-2315066	BB	0.119025	BB	-0.743524	9.940139AFFX-2315067	BB	0.048545	BB	-0.412548	10.850840AFFX-2315068	AA	0.053600	AA	0.819616	10.408120AFFX-2315069	BB	0.019577	BB	-0.821786	10.267441AFFX-2315070	BB	0.144850	BB	-0.825640	10.344058AFFX-2315071	AB	0.290283	AB	0.061283	8.942157AFFX-2315072	AA	0.227806	AA	0.749362	10.315930AFFX-2315073	AB	0.038759	AB	0.278775	10.435892AFFX-2315074	BB	0.191920	BB	-0.624097	9.730004AFFX-2315075	AB	0.001850	AB	0.101285	11.447119AFFX-2315076	BB	0.203881	BB	-0.736575	10.252649!sample_table_end
