The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672473/suppl/GSM672473_8135_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672473/suppl/GSM672473_8135_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.000203	AB	-0.096109	11.946675AFFX-2315061	BB	0.015378	BB	-0.783761	11.083273AFFX-2315062	AB	0.044339	AB	-0.160942	10.117270AFFX-2315057	BB	0.211190	BB	-0.579182	9.881075AFFX-2315058	AA	0.005720	AA	0.770769	11.879461AFFX-2315059	AA	0.217818	AA	0.663043	10.797271AFFX-2315063	AB	0.112042	AB	-0.305791	10.509989AFFX-2315064	AB	0.070544	AB	0.354963	10.092255AFFX-2315065	AA	0.148227	AA	0.620221	9.749854AFFX-2315066	AB	0.038157	AB	0.058937	10.310215AFFX-2315067	BB	0.001835	BB	-0.597812	11.027919AFFX-2315068	AA	0.045668	AA	0.816175	10.313739AFFX-2315069	AA	0.089960	AA	0.570982	9.838443AFFX-2315070	AA	0.136823	AA	0.518290	9.628563AFFX-2315071	AB	0.024422	AB	-0.195646	9.924286AFFX-2315072	AA	0.095409	AA	0.783569	10.810413AFFX-2315073	AA	0.033644	AA	0.767508	10.290063AFFX-2315074	BB	0.187063	BB	-0.396299	9.440308AFFX-2315075	AB	0.003592	AB	0.109537	11.530765AFFX-2315076	BB	0.117415	BB	-0.806383	10.713799!sample_table_end
