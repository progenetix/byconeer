The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672926/suppl/GSM672926_3921_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672926/suppl/GSM672926_3921_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.034986	AA	0.593141	11.926775AFFX-2315061	AB	0.007993	AB	0.043394	11.111485AFFX-2315062	AA	0.013080	AA	0.586908	10.471365AFFX-2315057	BB	0.021515	BB	-0.671403	10.925858AFFX-2315058	AA	0.063891	AA	0.663070	11.457392AFFX-2315059	AB	0.011477	AB	0.218004	10.568534AFFX-2315063	AB	0.012421	AB	-0.141316	10.901443AFFX-2315064	AB	0.014721	AB	0.147091	10.916415AFFX-2315065	BB	0.000224	BB	-0.469164	10.320475AFFX-2315066	AB	0.035840	AB	0.007006	10.714540AFFX-2315067	AA	0.156630	AA	0.402001	10.986329AFFX-2315068	AB	0.043950	AB	0.252522	10.950933AFFX-2315069	BB	0.012820	BB	-0.853829	10.763341AFFX-2315070	BB	0.064265	BB	-0.775504	10.504991AFFX-2315071	AB	0.007648	AB	-0.131798	9.920950AFFX-2315072	AB	0.012829	AB	-0.008016	10.613845AFFX-2315073	AB	0.010638	AB	0.126048	10.770336AFFX-2315074	BB	0.005238	BB	-0.596983	10.347012AFFX-2315075	AA	0.014462	AA	0.651842	11.425699AFFX-2315076	AB	0.034740	AB	-0.060038	10.743382!sample_table_end
