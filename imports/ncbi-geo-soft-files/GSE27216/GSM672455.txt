The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672455/suppl/GSM672455_2377_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672455/suppl/GSM672455_2377_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.010065	BB	-0.828694	11.907067AFFX-2315061	AB	0.015086	AB	0.241918	10.942167AFFX-2315062	AA	0.018148	AA	0.570321	10.175497AFFX-2315057	AA	0.019329	AA	0.462348	10.335739AFFX-2315058	AA	0.023919	AA	0.807517	11.833238AFFX-2315059	AA	0.005296	AA	0.850671	10.842009AFFX-2315063	AA	0.000890	AA	0.790384	10.488186AFFX-2315064	AA	0.015436	AA	0.736341	10.189447AFFX-2315065	BB	0.047587	BB	-0.431934	10.399896AFFX-2315066	BB	0.002860	BB	-0.710569	10.480430AFFX-2315067	AA	0.023862	AA	0.709855	11.253500AFFX-2315068	AB	0.037729	AB	-0.039794	10.416177AFFX-2315069	AB	0.017743	AB	0.003112	9.676948AFFX-2315070	BB	0.046247	BB	-0.609028	10.638728AFFX-2315071	AB	0.016516	AB	-0.189401	9.986696AFFX-2315072	AB	0.006687	AB	0.134060	11.393170AFFX-2315073	AB	0.048920	AB	0.286254	10.473928AFFX-2315074	AB	0.013689	AB	0.136735	9.941720AFFX-2315075	AA	0.015014	AA	0.795461	11.496678AFFX-2315076	AB	0.018014	AB	-0.094607	11.378934!sample_table_end
