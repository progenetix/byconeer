The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672449/suppl/GSM672449_1511_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672449/suppl/GSM672449_1511_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.001052	AB	-0.116700	12.006723AFFX-2315061	AB	0.000539	AB	0.156407	10.984059AFFX-2315062	AB	0.005729	AB	-0.007081	10.322573AFFX-2315057	AB	0.006421	AB	-0.112820	10.458575AFFX-2315058	AA	0.003469	AA	0.747250	11.938343AFFX-2315059	AB	0.022776	AB	0.326933	10.784341AFFX-2315063	AB	0.002583	AB	-0.199173	10.839122AFFX-2315064	AB	0.139887	AB	0.378507	10.119967AFFX-2315065	BB	0.006942	BB	-0.466711	10.284992AFFX-2315066	AB	0.008900	AB	-0.161044	10.247687AFFX-2315067	AA	0.004462	AA	0.636693	11.151616AFFX-2315068	AA	0.002714	AA	0.825615	10.616755AFFX-2315069	AA	0.018690	AA	0.621764	9.638448AFFX-2315070	BB	0.043574	BB	-0.531234	10.352995AFFX-2315071	AB	0.000300	AB	-0.183660	10.331029AFFX-2315072	AA	0.014745	AA	0.797568	11.133025AFFX-2315073	AA	0.003623	AA	0.786071	10.512191AFFX-2315074	BB	0.005193	BB	-0.521172	9.811187AFFX-2315075	BB	0.244553	BB	-0.436967	11.456779AFFX-2315076	AB	0.006271	AB	0.016056	11.354923!sample_table_end
