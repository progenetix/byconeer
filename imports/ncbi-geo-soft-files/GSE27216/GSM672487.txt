The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672487/suppl/GSM672487_8960_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672487/suppl/GSM672487_8960_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.003193	BB	-0.705347	12.250278AFFX-2315061	AB	0.000923	AB	0.157411	11.694668AFFX-2315062	AB	0.025701	AB	-0.118551	10.308639AFFX-2315057	BB	0.026939	BB	-0.475578	10.540459AFFX-2315058	AA	0.031185	AA	0.671792	12.060065AFFX-2315059	AB	0.001976	AB	0.260330	10.854452AFFX-2315063	AB	0.009684	AB	-0.181783	11.011977AFFX-2315064	AA	0.052630	AA	0.696833	10.290085AFFX-2315065	AB	0.020623	AB	0.004339	10.456642AFFX-2315066	BB	0.013173	BB	-0.637716	10.382952AFFX-2315067	BB	0.000915	BB	-0.573730	11.312854AFFX-2315068	AB	0.004669	AB	0.154973	10.676752AFFX-2315069	AB	0.008079	AB	-0.148982	10.190096AFFX-2315070	AB	0.063852	AB	-0.170097	10.417841AFFX-2315071	AA	0.021898	AA	0.683328	10.269537AFFX-2315072	AA	0.027184	AA	0.682794	11.076906AFFX-2315073	AA	0.005558	AA	0.737681	10.628836AFFX-2315074	AB	0.150880	AB	0.210177	9.815859AFFX-2315075	AA	0.014728	AA	0.688928	11.697373AFFX-2315076	AB	0.003888	AB	0.023323	11.138080!sample_table_end
