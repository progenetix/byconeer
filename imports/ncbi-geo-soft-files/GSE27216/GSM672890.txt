The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672890/suppl/GSM672890_2714_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672890/suppl/GSM672890_2714_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.003763	BB	-0.714132	12.311855AFFX-2315061	AB	0.002859	AB	0.139070	11.841936AFFX-2315062	AA	0.049898	AA	0.644446	10.645681AFFX-2315057	BB	0.092670	BB	-0.483377	10.885500AFFX-2315058	AA	0.005569	AA	0.705843	12.170661AFFX-2315059	AB	0.006814	AB	0.292891	10.918433AFFX-2315063	AB	0.005043	AB	-0.081338	11.064050AFFX-2315064	BB	0.010807	BB	-0.321888	10.058771AFFX-2315065	BB	0.002683	BB	-0.454922	10.568294AFFX-2315066	AB	0.031983	AB	0.093462	10.581480AFFX-2315067	BB	0.028382	BB	-0.629120	11.250431AFFX-2315068	BB	0.001684	BB	-0.752114	10.745256AFFX-2315069	AB	0.006122	AB	-0.136781	10.213915AFFX-2315070	BB	0.005957	BB	-0.529793	10.547603AFFX-2315071	BB	0.001373	BB	-0.803374	10.349809AFFX-2315072	AA	0.064101	AA	0.721502	11.231538AFFX-2315073	AB	0.000713	AB	0.133112	10.629918AFFX-2315074	BB	0.007640	BB	-0.389224	10.036556AFFX-2315075	AA	0.029222	AA	0.720858	11.813967AFFX-2315076	BB	0.011982	BB	-0.640547	11.232539!sample_table_end
