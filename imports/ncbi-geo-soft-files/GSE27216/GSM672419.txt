The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672419/suppl/GSM672419_4821_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672419/suppl/GSM672419_4821_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	NC	0.636920	AA	0.331674	11.836456AFFX-2315061	AA	0.095351	AA	0.705500	10.798893AFFX-2315062	AB	0.375869	AB	0.159858	10.524112AFFX-2315057	AB	0.085740	AB	0.020680	10.964387AFFX-2315058	AA	0.494666	AA	0.576580	10.920699AFFX-2315059	AB	0.056455	AB	0.376685	10.739786AFFX-2315063	AA	0.100281	AA	0.648995	10.665713AFFX-2315064	BB	0.129855	BB	-0.425924	10.543245AFFX-2315065	BB	0.402627	BB	-0.343609	10.204595AFFX-2315066	NC	0.633112	BB	-0.410957	10.792346AFFX-2315067	NC	0.550971	AB	0.266876	11.520242AFFX-2315068	AB	0.006507	AB	0.164896	10.747184AFFX-2315069	AB	0.149657	AB	-0.293939	10.274302AFFX-2315070	BB	0.044406	BB	-0.607965	10.724330AFFX-2315071	AB	0.011559	AB	-0.181859	9.758270AFFX-2315072	AA	0.367875	AA	0.398401	11.246452AFFX-2315073	NC	0.781110	AA	0.534588	11.169735AFFX-2315074	BB	0.090914	BB	-0.498859	10.427910AFFX-2315075	AB	0.054520	AB	0.169899	12.048095AFFX-2315076	AB	0.276646	AB	0.205546	11.061452!sample_table_end
