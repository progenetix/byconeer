The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672880/suppl/GSM672880_9609_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672880/suppl/GSM672880_9609_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.002042	AB	-0.047666	12.157812AFFX-2315061	BB	0.022476	BB	-0.811459	10.872393AFFX-2315062	AB	0.130314	AB	0.113634	10.725497AFFX-2315057	BB	0.004988	BB	-0.631047	11.085679AFFX-2315058	AB	0.000540	AB	0.158887	11.362369AFFX-2315059	BB	0.031259	BB	-0.543276	10.249287AFFX-2315063	AA	0.008771	AA	0.763197	10.667891AFFX-2315064	AA	0.007094	AA	0.812109	10.964453AFFX-2315065	AA	0.023395	AA	0.427698	10.357586AFFX-2315066	BB	0.054379	BB	-0.616564	10.406455AFFX-2315067	AB	0.027401	AB	0.123301	11.215681AFFX-2315068	AA	0.039457	AA	0.777564	10.570673AFFX-2315069	AB	0.034125	AB	-0.138551	10.401415AFFX-2315070	AB	0.060737	AB	0.037591	10.812222AFFX-2315071	AB	0.003243	AB	-0.064227	9.802855AFFX-2315072	AA	0.159273	AA	0.412947	11.057855AFFX-2315073	AA	0.159555	AA	0.761202	10.415712AFFX-2315074	BB	0.192014	BB	-0.523967	10.153044AFFX-2315075	AB	0.021685	AB	0.161333	11.565291AFFX-2315076	AB	0.024157	AB	0.018141	10.810010!sample_table_end
