The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672423/suppl/GSM672423_6932_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672423/suppl/GSM672423_6932_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.018050	AA	0.625632	11.906612AFFX-2315061	BB	0.004490	BB	-0.794973	10.893307AFFX-2315062	AB	0.038522	AB	-0.139141	10.344932AFFX-2315057	AB	0.020895	AB	-0.116671	10.575473AFFX-2315058	AA	0.040818	AA	0.704006	11.474327AFFX-2315059	AB	0.008446	AB	0.278812	10.488052AFFX-2315063	AA	0.000291	AA	0.753903	10.508241AFFX-2315064	AA	0.041535	AA	0.752560	10.820254AFFX-2315065	BB	0.016871	BB	-0.510614	10.403193AFFX-2315066	BB	0.034430	BB	-0.594432	10.538565AFFX-2315067	AA	0.041389	AA	0.454136	10.930135AFFX-2315068	AA	0.000483	AA	0.770125	10.594050AFFX-2315069	AB	0.000635	AB	-0.115983	10.602855AFFX-2315070	BB	0.043917	BB	-0.713696	10.450747AFFX-2315071	AA	0.019715	AA	0.586841	9.374985AFFX-2315072	AA	0.030531	AA	0.500450	10.567361AFFX-2315073	AB	0.001726	AB	0.138212	10.502530AFFX-2315074	AB	0.008271	AB	0.009232	10.227434AFFX-2315075	AB	0.010037	AB	-0.009697	11.405462AFFX-2315076	AB	0.086172	AB	-0.077930	10.562345!sample_table_end
