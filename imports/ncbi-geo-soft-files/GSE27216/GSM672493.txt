The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672493/suppl/GSM672493_9313_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672493/suppl/GSM672493_9313_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.010183	AA	0.712939	11.729856AFFX-2315061	AB	0.008408	AB	0.206641	10.889713AFFX-2315062	AB	0.003315	AB	-0.090819	10.450641AFFX-2315057	AB	0.024535	AB	0.017149	10.503857AFFX-2315058	AB	0.002903	AB	0.190476	11.827429AFFX-2315059	AB	0.001496	AB	0.250307	10.805958AFFX-2315063	AB	0.004725	AB	-0.098416	10.898267AFFX-2315064	AB	0.199473	AB	0.392724	10.136357AFFX-2315065	BB	0.045798	BB	-0.424152	10.237130AFFX-2315066	BB	0.022387	BB	-0.701225	10.253397AFFX-2315067	BB	0.002299	BB	-0.636899	10.990076AFFX-2315068	BB	0.002753	BB	-0.788557	10.438138AFFX-2315069	BB	0.020844	BB	-0.799976	9.765748AFFX-2315070	BB	0.006386	BB	-0.617351	10.481279AFFX-2315071	AB	0.006561	AB	-0.186466	10.536886AFFX-2315072	AA	0.007081	AA	0.787283	11.159554AFFX-2315073	AB	0.017244	AB	-0.022152	10.689808AFFX-2315074	BB	0.010653	BB	-0.551147	9.853011AFFX-2315075	AA	0.018572	AA	0.744356	11.685659AFFX-2315076	AB	0.003892	AB	-0.060972	11.192623!sample_table_end
