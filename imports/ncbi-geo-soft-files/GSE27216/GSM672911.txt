The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672911/suppl/GSM672911_7484_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672911/suppl/GSM672911_7484_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.006517	AB	-0.039135	12.013860AFFX-2315061	AB	0.007927	AB	0.212766	10.932144AFFX-2315062	AB	0.005692	AB	-0.102805	10.247714AFFX-2315057	BB	0.031999	BB	-0.640212	10.485414AFFX-2315058	AA	0.020361	AA	0.830570	11.946065AFFX-2315059	BB	0.005908	BB	-0.750490	10.347480AFFX-2315063	AB	0.005861	AB	-0.087302	10.829783AFFX-2315064	AB	0.025533	AB	0.305534	9.967603AFFX-2315065	AB	0.023775	AB	-0.000143	10.289220AFFX-2315066	BB	0.050400	BB	-0.743779	10.250097AFFX-2315067	BB	0.015328	BB	-0.563487	10.875208AFFX-2315068	BB	0.018809	BB	-0.794757	10.240638AFFX-2315069	AB	0.021440	AB	-0.019551	9.561200AFFX-2315070	BB	0.011843	BB	-0.578341	10.478384AFFX-2315071	AA	0.006518	AA	0.791966	9.974295AFFX-2315072	AA	0.004915	AA	0.734832	11.153743AFFX-2315073	AB	0.006708	AB	0.059601	10.521311AFFX-2315074	BB	0.059489	BB	-0.424198	9.903616AFFX-2315075	AA	0.011820	AA	0.791130	11.521749AFFX-2315076	BB	0.001312	BB	-0.715807	11.118844!sample_table_end
