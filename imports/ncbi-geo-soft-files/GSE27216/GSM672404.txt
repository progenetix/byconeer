The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672404/suppl/GSM672404_1511_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672404/suppl/GSM672404_1511_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.002144	AB	-0.099429	11.902770AFFX-2315061	AB	0.002466	AB	0.155538	10.948836AFFX-2315062	AB	0.012522	AB	-0.062155	10.412992AFFX-2315057	AB	0.000786	AB	-0.115365	10.705621AFFX-2315058	AA	0.006684	AA	0.719438	11.135307AFFX-2315059	AB	0.035727	AB	0.364164	10.436721AFFX-2315063	AB	0.001744	AB	-0.066703	10.839604AFFX-2315064	AB	0.017106	AB	0.259365	10.953191AFFX-2315065	BB	0.008135	BB	-0.447835	10.369447AFFX-2315066	AB	0.003137	AB	-0.018880	10.330947AFFX-2315067	AA	0.015093	AA	0.574072	11.081862AFFX-2315068	AA	0.006261	AA	0.743231	10.528831AFFX-2315069	AA	0.009118	AA	0.710231	10.467749AFFX-2315070	BB	0.037653	BB	-0.588844	10.706546AFFX-2315071	AB	0.000868	AB	-0.142457	9.721789AFFX-2315072	AA	0.008653	AA	0.520537	10.636811AFFX-2315073	AA	0.012718	AA	0.765464	10.523885AFFX-2315074	BB	0.028692	BB	-0.538410	10.360972AFFX-2315075	BB	0.139241	BB	-0.472899	11.300898AFFX-2315076	AB	0.039427	AB	0.047848	10.865432!sample_table_end
