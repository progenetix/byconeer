The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672479/suppl/GSM672479_8327_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672479/suppl/GSM672479_8327_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.014380	BB	-0.828154	11.843794AFFX-2315061	AB	0.002423	AB	0.086792	10.959694AFFX-2315062	AA	0.016030	AA	0.570662	10.156505AFFX-2315057	AA	0.040953	AA	0.438835	10.375093AFFX-2315058	AA	0.011890	AA	0.810093	11.919520AFFX-2315059	BB	0.000351	BB	-0.774450	10.563419AFFX-2315063	AA	0.004805	AA	0.796458	10.401255AFFX-2315064	AB	0.052817	AB	0.345095	10.116955AFFX-2315065	AA	0.091000	AA	0.347464	10.245678AFFX-2315066	BB	0.013805	BB	-0.745707	10.448640AFFX-2315067	BB	0.011877	BB	-0.562931	10.921874AFFX-2315068	AA	0.001149	AA	0.856987	10.760064AFFX-2315069	AB	0.013112	AB	-0.032181	9.642925AFFX-2315070	BB	0.002378	BB	-0.587420	10.418779AFFX-2315071	AA	0.001428	AA	0.751055	10.068343AFFX-2315072	AA	0.004557	AA	0.745270	11.063539AFFX-2315073	BB	0.003182	BB	-0.719607	10.402061AFFX-2315074	AB	0.002397	AB	0.114201	9.850929AFFX-2315075	AB	0.004734	AB	0.088974	11.760598AFFX-2315076	BB	0.000424	BB	-0.707329	11.100962!sample_table_end
