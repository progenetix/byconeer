The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672867/suppl/GSM672867_7484_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672867/suppl/GSM672867_7484_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.017743	AB	-0.080658	11.718308AFFX-2315061	AB	0.017959	AB	0.218527	11.019453AFFX-2315062	AB	0.014839	AB	-0.115523	10.642029AFFX-2315057	BB	0.040672	BB	-0.696796	10.739328AFFX-2315058	AB	0.010811	AB	0.167335	11.236872AFFX-2315059	AB	0.005933	AB	0.249503	10.500380AFFX-2315063	BB	0.024767	BB	-0.810230	10.874020AFFX-2315064	AB	0.010695	AB	0.153154	10.858605AFFX-2315065	AA	0.071461	AA	0.613106	9.995429AFFX-2315066	AB	0.015025	AB	0.108215	10.404375AFFX-2315067	AB	0.003652	AB	0.031136	11.038698AFFX-2315068	AB	0.027146	AB	0.272301	10.604188AFFX-2315069	AA	0.026480	AA	0.700725	10.591791AFFX-2315070	AB	0.149531	AB	-0.259340	10.399870AFFX-2315071	AB	0.004029	AB	-0.191310	9.824683AFFX-2315072	AA	0.023715	AA	0.585000	10.646336AFFX-2315073	AA	0.086681	AA	0.643364	10.659317AFFX-2315074	BB	0.009424	BB	-0.634396	10.299733AFFX-2315075	AB	0.005713	AB	0.060211	11.585752AFFX-2315076	AB	0.022782	AB	-0.035364	10.628935!sample_table_end
