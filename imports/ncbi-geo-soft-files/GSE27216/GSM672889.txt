The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672889/suppl/GSM672889_1815_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672889/suppl/GSM672889_1815_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.015106	AA	0.542580	12.158352AFFX-2315061	AB	0.007335	AB	0.154107	11.562411AFFX-2315062	AB	0.006315	AB	-0.112461	10.460208AFFX-2315057	AA	0.052560	AA	0.333089	10.610776AFFX-2315058	AA	0.038638	AA	0.735064	12.080426AFFX-2315059	BB	0.001675	BB	-0.648919	10.688087AFFX-2315063	AB	0.001369	AB	-0.111197	10.819639AFFX-2315064	NC	0.871184	AB	-0.065690	10.020098AFFX-2315065	AA	0.083908	AA	0.363466	10.633270AFFX-2315066	BB	0.000060	BB	-0.629653	10.502142AFFX-2315067	AA	0.067050	AA	0.618796	11.259377AFFX-2315068	AB	0.022057	AB	-0.007637	10.623651AFFX-2315069	AB	0.045752	AB	-0.172911	9.941558AFFX-2315070	AA	0.071898	AA	0.362719	10.484333AFFX-2315071	BB	0.024997	BB	-0.783978	10.179317AFFX-2315072	AA	0.016454	AA	0.667290	11.037055AFFX-2315073	BB	0.007514	BB	-0.568683	10.441629AFFX-2315074	AA	0.098028	AA	0.654596	9.838343AFFX-2315075	AB	0.031373	AB	0.026550	11.897716AFFX-2315076	BB	0.003823	BB	-0.612533	11.086205!sample_table_end
