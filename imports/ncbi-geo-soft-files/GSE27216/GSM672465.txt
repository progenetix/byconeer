The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672465/suppl/GSM672465_4821_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672465/suppl/GSM672465_4821_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.013043	AA	0.565079	12.360126AFFX-2315061	AB	0.003401	AB	0.102516	11.844157AFFX-2315062	AA	0.004961	AA	0.579039	10.403514AFFX-2315057	BB	0.007695	BB	-0.453665	10.561647AFFX-2315058	AA	0.060470	AA	0.701081	12.526572AFFX-2315059	BB	0.011184	BB	-0.667542	10.992508AFFX-2315063	AA	0.016504	AA	0.813895	10.699582AFFX-2315064	BB	0.002635	BB	-0.356810	10.053087AFFX-2315065	AB	0.046861	AB	0.024283	10.744102AFFX-2315066	BB	0.012291	BB	-0.672908	10.525660AFFX-2315067	AB	0.000363	AB	0.022326	11.378355AFFX-2315068	BB	0.011398	BB	-0.766041	10.948430AFFX-2315069	AB	0.010725	AB	-0.097520	10.654474AFFX-2315070	AB	0.050555	AB	-0.171111	10.626538AFFX-2315071	AB	0.007066	AB	-0.245842	10.481147AFFX-2315072	AA	0.006974	AA	0.609755	10.865714AFFX-2315073	AA	0.000427	AA	0.710856	10.568276AFFX-2315074	AB	0.080718	AB	0.222109	9.953178AFFX-2315075	AB	0.002373	AB	0.048334	11.485056AFFX-2315076	AA	0.028675	AA	0.645698	11.104801!sample_table_end
