The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672410/suppl/GSM672410_2377_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672410/suppl/GSM672410_2377_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.013848	BB	-0.623258	11.896383AFFX-2315061	AB	0.006224	AB	0.038794	11.058185AFFX-2315062	AA	0.050627	AA	0.662925	10.397393AFFX-2315057	AA	0.034497	AA	0.657835	10.685473AFFX-2315058	AA	0.013028	AA	0.704465	11.354307AFFX-2315059	AA	0.008560	AA	0.751759	10.401571AFFX-2315063	AA	0.024837	AA	0.816678	10.800159AFFX-2315064	AA	0.046354	AA	0.831158	11.008348AFFX-2315065	BB	0.100980	BB	-0.514452	10.608543AFFX-2315066	BB	0.048590	BB	-0.759624	10.564353AFFX-2315067	AA	0.052894	AA	0.476486	11.150786AFFX-2315068	AB	0.016992	AB	0.201020	10.842181AFFX-2315069	AB	0.006258	AB	-0.116023	10.738444AFFX-2315070	BB	0.068992	BB	-0.789437	10.749711AFFX-2315071	AB	0.036221	AB	0.006902	9.876641AFFX-2315072	AB	0.003689	AB	-0.087869	10.741505AFFX-2315073	AB	0.023642	AB	0.106302	10.881855AFFX-2315074	AB	0.025833	AB	-0.063408	10.405044AFFX-2315075	AA	0.021468	AA	0.707046	11.574459AFFX-2315076	AB	0.073184	AB	0.142251	10.755419!sample_table_end
