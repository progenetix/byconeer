The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672456/suppl/GSM672456_2377_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672456/suppl/GSM672456_2377_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.000538	AB	-0.112318	11.930698AFFX-2315061	BB	0.001186	BB	-0.817212	10.787026AFFX-2315062	AB	0.000552	AB	-0.073388	10.395101AFFX-2315057	AA	0.005959	AA	0.540715	10.294478AFFX-2315058	AA	0.008497	AA	0.780290	11.868793AFFX-2315059	AA	0.005368	AA	0.850449	10.838673AFFX-2315063	AA	0.005625	AA	0.837925	10.471708AFFX-2315064	AB	0.031265	AB	0.314202	10.187147AFFX-2315065	AB	0.034942	AB	-0.139334	10.337112AFFX-2315066	BB	0.018882	BB	-0.748082	10.406520AFFX-2315067	AB	0.003974	AB	0.017351	11.253330AFFX-2315068	AB	0.002274	AB	0.071979	10.755082AFFX-2315069	AB	0.011197	AB	-0.006849	9.760615AFFX-2315070	BB	0.015808	BB	-0.657066	10.464190AFFX-2315071	BB	0.000479	BB	-0.835190	10.358621AFFX-2315072	AB	0.000635	AB	0.092073	11.233365AFFX-2315073	AA	0.001679	AA	0.803244	10.654256AFFX-2315074	BB	0.015507	BB	-0.570910	9.919929AFFX-2315075	AA	0.011490	AA	0.793133	11.570855AFFX-2315076	BB	0.006080	BB	-0.719592	11.234590!sample_table_end
