The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672864/suppl/GSM672864_7093_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672864/suppl/GSM672864_7093_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.002245	AB	-0.094812	11.910739AFFX-2315061	BB	0.000365	BB	-0.778126	10.737264AFFX-2315062	BB	0.004520	BB	-0.638007	10.424565AFFX-2315057	AB	0.041939	AB	-0.218278	10.693190AFFX-2315058	AA	0.009264	AA	0.681760	11.086414AFFX-2315059	BB	0.095269	BB	-0.460146	10.010668AFFX-2315063	AB	0.003816	AB	-0.014117	10.761619AFFX-2315064	BB	0.000467	BB	-0.693275	10.550526AFFX-2315065	AB	0.010354	AB	-0.008763	10.345948AFFX-2315066	AB	0.007161	AB	0.009163	10.518764AFFX-2315067	AB	0.039818	AB	0.144510	10.984688AFFX-2315068	AB	0.001900	AB	0.178250	10.567947AFFX-2315069	AA	0.001426	AA	0.790156	10.452654AFFX-2315070	AA	0.040468	AA	0.501297	10.491389AFFX-2315071	AB	0.018228	AB	-0.119894	9.544072AFFX-2315072	AA	0.016197	AA	0.514777	10.604455AFFX-2315073	AA	0.007530	AA	0.715353	10.639298AFFX-2315074	BB	0.004831	BB	-0.552200	10.255970AFFX-2315075	BB	0.002039	BB	-0.632360	11.433454AFFX-2315076	BB	0.001540	BB	-0.495101	10.651152!sample_table_end
