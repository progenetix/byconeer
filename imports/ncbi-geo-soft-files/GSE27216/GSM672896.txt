The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672896/suppl/GSM672896_3519_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672896/suppl/GSM672896_3519_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.008588	AB	-0.042321	11.883248AFFX-2315061	AB	0.003136	AB	0.083728	11.110337AFFX-2315062	BB	0.024307	BB	-0.690719	10.512059AFFX-2315057	AB	0.007046	AB	-0.080829	10.400694AFFX-2315058	AA	0.010871	AA	0.785021	11.860318AFFX-2315059	BB	0.002643	BB	-0.775307	10.447567AFFX-2315063	AB	0.006040	AB	-0.094170	10.931872AFFX-2315064	AB	0.118287	AB	0.372296	10.074249AFFX-2315065	AB	0.192660	AB	-0.136095	10.059216AFFX-2315066	BB	0.047265	BB	-0.708051	10.185940AFFX-2315067	AB	0.003112	AB	0.083805	11.183119AFFX-2315068	AA	0.001759	AA	0.849342	10.639068AFFX-2315069	BB	0.045493	BB	-0.676036	9.644100AFFX-2315070	AB	0.037085	AB	0.062088	10.360202AFFX-2315071	AB	0.004880	AB	-0.093003	10.256945AFFX-2315072	AA	0.007354	AA	0.766726	11.065607AFFX-2315073	AB	0.002131	AB	0.087574	10.571913AFFX-2315074	AB	0.006003	AB	0.057175	9.731368AFFX-2315075	AB	0.001374	AB	0.102195	11.599639AFFX-2315076	AA	0.046576	AA	0.657295	10.808162!sample_table_end
