The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672840/suppl/GSM672840_1780_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672840/suppl/GSM672840_1780_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.002142	BB	-0.668613	12.229294AFFX-2315061	AB	0.000973	AB	0.092949	11.295479AFFX-2315062	AB	0.015404	AB	-0.034107	10.959877AFFX-2315057	AA	0.012663	AA	0.556894	10.927266AFFX-2315058	BB	0.004103	BB	-0.658219	10.975593AFFX-2315059	AA	0.002174	AA	0.757853	10.667150AFFX-2315063	AB	0.002203	AB	-0.008464	11.124081AFFX-2315064	AB	0.011827	AB	0.140627	11.127537AFFX-2315065	BB	0.014505	BB	-0.449862	10.668833AFFX-2315066	BB	0.007818	BB	-0.666047	10.798796AFFX-2315067	AB	0.000748	AB	0.055679	11.222534AFFX-2315068	AA	0.004803	AA	0.789364	10.932776AFFX-2315069	AA	0.007864	AA	0.812693	10.746106AFFX-2315070	AB	0.035369	AB	-0.172420	11.081014AFFX-2315071	AB	0.009388	AB	-0.199657	9.845144AFFX-2315072	AA	0.002480	AA	0.508099	10.968821AFFX-2315073	AA	0.059040	AA	0.733481	11.178060AFFX-2315074	AB	0.002544	AB	0.000969	10.603531AFFX-2315075	AA	0.008185	AA	0.661406	11.824473AFFX-2315076	AB	0.022709	AB	-0.030306	11.053272!sample_table_end
