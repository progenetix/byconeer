The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672489/suppl/GSM672489_8994_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672489/suppl/GSM672489_8994_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.001044	AA	0.601136	12.215318AFFX-2315061	BB	0.011253	BB	-0.799267	11.243869AFFX-2315062	AB	0.027932	AB	-0.058276	10.788454AFFX-2315057	BB	0.131722	BB	-0.620225	10.873230AFFX-2315058	AA	0.019497	AA	0.746474	12.287993AFFX-2315059	AA	0.029439	AA	0.821557	11.203712AFFX-2315063	AA	0.050530	AA	0.811769	11.045633AFFX-2315064	AA	0.134379	AA	0.723134	10.524481AFFX-2315065	BB	0.080480	BB	-0.416670	10.857449AFFX-2315066	BB	0.068159	BB	-0.685074	10.836423AFFX-2315067	BB	0.025650	BB	-0.632147	11.352962AFFX-2315068	AA	0.012022	AA	0.844439	10.996963AFFX-2315069	AA	0.043327	AA	0.565542	9.910587AFFX-2315070	AB	0.027616	AB	-0.067419	10.726161AFFX-2315071	AA	0.031152	AA	0.791003	10.528761AFFX-2315072	AA	0.156155	AA	0.739075	11.548908AFFX-2315073	AB	0.054832	AB	0.185188	11.196925AFFX-2315074	BB	0.037686	BB	-0.472791	10.303363AFFX-2315075	AA	0.050532	AA	0.736727	11.964741AFFX-2315076	BB	0.035744	BB	-0.680703	11.459672!sample_table_end
