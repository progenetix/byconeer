The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672458/suppl/GSM672458_2569_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672458/suppl/GSM672458_2569_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.016481	AB	-0.013260	12.369800AFFX-2315061	BB	0.002275	BB	-0.754635	11.373227AFFX-2315062	BB	0.084161	BB	-0.749025	10.836830AFFX-2315057	BB	0.086770	BB	-0.565093	10.832574AFFX-2315058	AA	0.049888	AA	0.686671	12.480503AFFX-2315059	AB	0.026617	AB	0.129043	11.263357AFFX-2315063	AA	0.093744	AA	0.825301	11.195667AFFX-2315064	AB	0.028930	AB	0.253132	10.366823AFFX-2315065	AB	0.037200	AB	0.009651	10.740499AFFX-2315066	AB	0.098116	AB	-0.146236	10.904506AFFX-2315067	AB	0.036427	AB	-0.071230	11.705163AFFX-2315068	AB	0.025884	AB	0.059275	11.249251AFFX-2315069	AB	0.010583	AB	-0.207284	10.283399AFFX-2315070	BB	0.075707	BB	-0.666729	10.833832AFFX-2315071	AB	0.034984	AB	-0.114940	11.044744AFFX-2315072	AB	0.067823	AB	-0.032032	11.750390AFFX-2315073	AA	0.136076	AA	0.756927	11.335402AFFX-2315074	BB	0.043630	BB	-0.533022	10.287809AFFX-2315075	AA	0.071055	AA	0.707586	12.032823AFFX-2315076	AB	0.069037	AB	-0.013293	11.575358!sample_table_end
