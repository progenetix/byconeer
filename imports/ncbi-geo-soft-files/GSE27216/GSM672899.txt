The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672899/suppl/GSM672899_3921_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672899/suppl/GSM672899_3921_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.004511	AA	0.737733	11.969528AFFX-2315061	AA	0.001368	AA	0.878723	11.008629AFFX-2315062	AA	0.011301	AA	0.723485	10.287886AFFX-2315057	AB	0.000151	AB	-0.076394	10.488925AFFX-2315058	AA	0.005764	AA	0.802313	11.976371AFFX-2315059	AB	0.002182	AB	0.233121	10.851868AFFX-2315063	BB	0.001218	BB	-0.802175	10.990473AFFX-2315064	AB	0.049185	AB	0.343611	10.053655AFFX-2315065	AB	0.024290	AB	-0.097566	10.249043AFFX-2315066	BB	0.015827	BB	-0.723307	10.322872AFFX-2315067	AA	0.019948	AA	0.677841	11.127989AFFX-2315068	AA	0.000649	AA	0.844186	10.744064AFFX-2315069	AB	0.002228	AB	-0.145053	9.948127AFFX-2315070	AB	0.007396	AB	0.002489	10.382002AFFX-2315071	BB	0.002833	BB	-0.851423	10.354198AFFX-2315072	AA	0.001445	AA	0.768481	11.140867AFFX-2315073	BB	0.004064	BB	-0.743594	10.663056AFFX-2315074	AB	0.013809	AB	0.005955	9.878167AFFX-2315075	AA	0.004724	AA	0.754855	11.455361AFFX-2315076	AB	0.001007	AB	-0.028728	11.160663!sample_table_end
