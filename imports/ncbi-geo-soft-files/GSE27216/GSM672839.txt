The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672839/suppl/GSM672839_1056_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672839/suppl/GSM672839_1056_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.000304	BB	-0.655116	12.163917AFFX-2315061	AA	0.001776	AA	0.832817	11.255195AFFX-2315062	AA	0.026625	AA	0.556787	10.865721AFFX-2315057	BB	0.018889	BB	-0.658711	11.152861AFFX-2315058	AA	0.016800	AA	0.693348	11.446997AFFX-2315059	AA	0.018477	AA	0.767838	10.724169AFFX-2315063	AA	0.005146	AA	0.825029	10.876718AFFX-2315064	AA	0.031905	AA	0.803769	11.303926AFFX-2315065	AA	0.014592	AA	0.510783	10.559127AFFX-2315066	AB	0.014035	AB	-0.022987	10.897271AFFX-2315067	AB	0.024769	AB	-0.005571	11.388126AFFX-2315068	AA	0.004666	AA	0.811793	10.924042AFFX-2315069	AA	0.007519	AA	0.834818	10.676723AFFX-2315070	BB	0.031508	BB	-0.726996	11.106194AFFX-2315071	AB	0.019951	AB	-0.166941	9.663021AFFX-2315072	AA	0.017364	AA	0.558267	11.040687AFFX-2315073	AA	0.026091	AA	0.733084	11.083167AFFX-2315074	BB	0.011501	BB	-0.640211	10.631809AFFX-2315075	AB	0.013393	AB	0.185655	11.857262AFFX-2315076	AB	0.037681	AB	-0.019155	11.162170!sample_table_end
