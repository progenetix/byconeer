The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672837/suppl/GSM672837_1056_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672837/suppl/GSM672837_1056_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.009228	AB	-0.008376	12.215817AFFX-2315061	AB	0.006598	AB	0.164240	11.342122AFFX-2315062	AA	0.010434	AA	0.607536	10.819308AFFX-2315057	AB	0.028262	AB	-0.114333	11.112316AFFX-2315058	AA	0.025956	AA	0.726205	11.472412AFFX-2315059	AA	0.013724	AA	0.782825	10.664156AFFX-2315063	AA	0.006760	AA	0.793990	10.922810AFFX-2315064	AA	0.014908	AA	0.772813	11.166419AFFX-2315065	AA	0.000700	AA	0.460821	10.504635AFFX-2315066	AB	0.004155	AB	-0.018287	10.798400AFFX-2315067	AB	0.012730	AB	-0.022711	11.161564AFFX-2315068	AB	0.005161	AB	0.120307	10.925291AFFX-2315069	AA	0.008539	AA	0.793821	10.757594AFFX-2315070	AB	0.013315	AB	-0.091460	11.045438AFFX-2315071	AB	0.002106	AB	-0.155306	9.943994AFFX-2315072	AA	0.000982	AA	0.532093	10.972992AFFX-2315073	AA	0.001038	AA	0.748437	10.880772AFFX-2315074	BB	0.004477	BB	-0.606354	10.615173AFFX-2315075	AA	0.025368	AA	0.738659	11.749588AFFX-2315076	AA	0.033418	AA	0.497891	11.124290!sample_table_end
