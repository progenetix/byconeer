The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672482/suppl/GSM672482_8612_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672482/suppl/GSM672482_8612_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.000374	BB	-0.763961	11.891146AFFX-2315061	AA	0.007506	AA	0.881391	11.160276AFFX-2315062	AB	0.027509	AB	-0.134627	10.629836AFFX-2315057	BB	0.003511	BB	-0.574861	10.572884AFFX-2315058	AA	0.004543	AA	0.745420	11.922528AFFX-2315059	AB	0.008918	AB	0.294607	10.776339AFFX-2315063	BB	0.000289	BB	-0.787540	10.952241AFFX-2315064	BB	0.008690	BB	-0.431486	9.929183AFFX-2315065	AA	0.006736	AA	0.436663	10.301409AFFX-2315066	BB	0.003179	BB	-0.721996	10.428035AFFX-2315067	BB	0.005887	BB	-0.588297	11.055797AFFX-2315068	AB	0.002532	AB	0.089556	10.841061AFFX-2315069	AA	0.021179	AA	0.632754	9.556971AFFX-2315070	BB	0.004321	BB	-0.614527	10.337075AFFX-2315071	BB	0.006019	BB	-0.859503	10.448707AFFX-2315072	AA	0.013453	AA	0.796972	11.287519AFFX-2315073	AB	0.006127	AB	0.177989	10.763147AFFX-2315074	BB	0.018569	BB	-0.439578	9.799679AFFX-2315075	AA	0.012239	AA	0.761190	11.659287AFFX-2315076	AB	0.001183	AB	-0.010837	11.258533!sample_table_end
