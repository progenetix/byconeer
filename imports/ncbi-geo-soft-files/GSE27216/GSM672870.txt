The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672870/suppl/GSM672870_7531_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672870/suppl/GSM672870_7531_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.012213	AA	0.617885	11.856347AFFX-2315061	AB	0.003837	AB	0.168687	10.920327AFFX-2315062	BB	0.001448	BB	-0.615931	10.469406AFFX-2315057	AB	0.003948	AB	-0.149109	10.666356AFFX-2315058	AA	0.008411	AA	0.682356	11.092093AFFX-2315059	AB	0.076383	AB	0.370843	10.150921AFFX-2315063	AA	0.015855	AA	0.761858	10.318908AFFX-2315064	AA	0.001394	AA	0.811918	10.649918AFFX-2315065	AA	0.025038	AA	0.529579	10.063157AFFX-2315066	BB	0.002485	BB	-0.656902	10.331059AFFX-2315067	AB	0.015977	AB	0.112475	10.942773AFFX-2315068	BB	0.002049	BB	-0.636151	10.546686AFFX-2315069	AB	0.014840	AB	-0.031935	10.435283AFFX-2315070	BB	0.015036	BB	-0.627469	10.524434AFFX-2315071	BB	0.105564	BB	-0.730421	9.456729AFFX-2315072	AA	0.052155	AA	0.480049	10.538578AFFX-2315073	AA	0.002623	AA	0.706590	10.560152AFFX-2315074	BB	0.040929	BB	-0.498321	10.225651AFFX-2315075	AA	0.012290	AA	0.635436	11.595321AFFX-2315076	AB	0.010859	AB	-0.024552	10.687818!sample_table_end
