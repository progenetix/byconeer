The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672454/suppl/GSM672454_2332_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672454/suppl/GSM672454_2332_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.002223	AB	-0.072039	12.021739AFFX-2315061	BB	0.000261	BB	-0.818377	10.847666AFFX-2315062	AB	0.000380	AB	-0.057623	10.320866AFFX-2315057	BB	0.013659	BB	-0.600531	10.461254AFFX-2315058	AA	0.001670	AA	0.754730	11.970705AFFX-2315059	AA	0.006700	AA	0.820010	10.748579AFFX-2315063	AA	0.000217	AA	0.794897	10.552085AFFX-2315064	AA	0.006897	AA	0.724269	10.060118AFFX-2315065	AA	0.003193	AA	0.499713	10.228048AFFX-2315066	BB	0.003343	BB	-0.719670	10.406423AFFX-2315067	AA	0.003765	AA	0.643269	11.279589AFFX-2315068	AB	0.002241	AB	0.123270	10.577469AFFX-2315069	AB	0.011630	AB	-0.137606	9.653157AFFX-2315070	AB	0.005707	AB	-0.110482	10.363718AFFX-2315071	BB	0.002870	BB	-0.850589	10.397403AFFX-2315072	AB	0.002106	AB	0.123279	11.226678AFFX-2315073	AA	0.004011	AA	0.770827	10.682302AFFX-2315074	AB	0.000562	AB	0.099623	9.818200AFFX-2315075	AA	0.019852	AA	0.695919	11.606757AFFX-2315076	BB	0.002627	BB	-0.717358	11.068741!sample_table_end
