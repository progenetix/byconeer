The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672909/suppl/GSM672909_7093_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672909/suppl/GSM672909_7093_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.000033	AB	-0.103606	11.955147AFFX-2315061	BB	0.002906	BB	-0.835644	10.961339AFFX-2315062	BB	0.021411	BB	-0.659418	10.086957AFFX-2315057	AB	0.176579	AB	-0.086374	10.029161AFFX-2315058	AA	0.032724	AA	0.719260	12.056592AFFX-2315059	BB	0.010414	BB	-0.757151	10.284650AFFX-2315063	AB	0.000721	AB	-0.179473	10.836860AFFX-2315064	BB	0.072478	BB	-0.336946	9.936584AFFX-2315065	AB	0.025061	AB	-0.113509	10.279157AFFX-2315066	AB	0.012174	AB	-0.209290	10.342075AFFX-2315067	AB	0.039358	AB	-0.031159	10.931148AFFX-2315068	AB	0.022429	AB	0.247927	10.583295AFFX-2315069	AA	0.001295	AA	0.701532	9.740368AFFX-2315070	AA	0.033140	AA	0.511024	9.975102AFFX-2315071	AB	0.000121	AB	-0.160298	10.289989AFFX-2315072	AA	0.006082	AA	0.776582	11.108375AFFX-2315073	AA	0.010002	AA	0.783880	10.788084AFFX-2315074	BB	0.008739	BB	-0.476334	9.890759AFFX-2315075	BB	0.024215	BB	-0.557991	11.356954AFFX-2315076	BB	0.018857	BB	-0.695839	11.315728!sample_table_end
