The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672409/suppl/GSM672409_2332_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672409/suppl/GSM672409_2332_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.002554	AB	-0.035210	11.838157AFFX-2315061	BB	0.007770	BB	-0.796167	10.932100AFFX-2315062	AB	0.027718	AB	-0.180500	10.580373AFFX-2315057	BB	0.037291	BB	-0.671008	10.994421AFFX-2315058	AA	0.003297	AA	0.698813	11.275217AFFX-2315059	AA	0.009550	AA	0.770927	10.420218AFFX-2315063	AA	0.004933	AA	0.781422	10.644743AFFX-2315064	AA	0.005060	AA	0.819563	10.792390AFFX-2315065	AA	0.050430	AA	0.631210	10.278682AFFX-2315066	BB	0.002483	BB	-0.666893	10.369573AFFX-2315067	AA	0.009017	AA	0.520428	10.933837AFFX-2315068	AB	0.035898	AB	-0.013311	10.618276AFFX-2315069	AB	0.005327	AB	-0.188784	10.520044AFFX-2315070	AB	0.001867	AB	-0.098617	10.638337AFFX-2315071	BB	0.019198	BB	-0.713347	9.946620AFFX-2315072	AB	0.046732	AB	0.084613	10.724775AFFX-2315073	AA	0.003339	AA	0.728654	10.504006AFFX-2315074	AB	0.001715	AB	0.029903	10.356691AFFX-2315075	AA	0.048466	AA	0.642226	11.693889AFFX-2315076	BB	0.017331	BB	-0.555313	10.555135!sample_table_end
