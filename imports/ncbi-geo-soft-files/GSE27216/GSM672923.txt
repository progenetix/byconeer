The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672923/suppl/GSM672923_9609_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672923/suppl/GSM672923_9609_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.000217	AB	-0.112554	12.342103AFFX-2315061	BB	0.002372	BB	-0.765210	11.362590AFFX-2315062	AB	0.097434	AB	-0.158307	10.946991AFFX-2315057	BB	0.162031	BB	-0.532398	11.043694AFFX-2315058	AA	0.014373	AA	0.723468	12.363780AFFX-2315059	AB	0.020691	AB	0.236790	11.199306AFFX-2315063	AA	0.056847	AA	0.789430	11.053639AFFX-2315064	AB	0.176924	AB	0.358351	10.378721AFFX-2315065	AB	0.012587	AB	-0.054837	10.649428AFFX-2315066	BB	0.034033	BB	-0.623673	10.689998AFFX-2315067	AB	0.044745	AB	0.030343	11.689588AFFX-2315068	AA	0.018184	AA	0.840913	11.083511AFFX-2315069	AB	0.019289	AB	-0.182099	10.116618AFFX-2315070	AB	0.066962	AB	-0.107335	10.829229AFFX-2315071	AB	0.033557	AB	-0.190431	10.940239AFFX-2315072	AA	0.208964	AA	0.764281	11.698386AFFX-2315073	AB	0.045385	AB	0.096989	11.231219AFFX-2315074	BB	0.015916	BB	-0.490627	10.141437AFFX-2315075	AA	0.111682	AA	0.689366	12.122396AFFX-2315076	AA	0.075406	AA	0.604331	11.570541!sample_table_end
