The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672851/suppl/GSM672851_3094_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672851/suppl/GSM672851_3094_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.000957	AA	0.645718	12.052841AFFX-2315061	BB	0.000280	BB	-0.785280	11.096714AFFX-2315062	AB	0.005958	AB	-0.076930	10.742005AFFX-2315057	NC	0.592223	BB	-0.423762	10.651492AFFX-2315058	AA	0.012444	AA	0.674309	11.464972AFFX-2315059	AA	0.000527	AA	0.751751	10.623724AFFX-2315063	AB	0.000744	AB	-0.003005	11.066051AFFX-2315064	BB	0.001293	BB	-0.675790	10.847361AFFX-2315065	AA	0.044389	AA	0.382560	10.437828AFFX-2315066	BB	0.006719	BB	-0.647361	10.776150AFFX-2315067	BB	0.013981	BB	-0.487599	11.135485AFFX-2315068	AA	0.023811	AA	0.746440	10.947679AFFX-2315069	AB	0.010469	AB	-0.074217	10.902143AFFX-2315070	BB	0.002622	BB	-0.701208	10.871778AFFX-2315071	AB	0.005599	AB	-0.187004	9.930840AFFX-2315072	AB	0.001131	AB	-0.064028	10.930032AFFX-2315073	AB	0.000968	AB	0.174150	10.936259AFFX-2315074	BB	0.005052	BB	-0.610572	10.620226AFFX-2315075	AA	0.008602	AA	0.710333	11.749490AFFX-2315076	AB	0.022417	AB	0.022347	11.117847!sample_table_end
