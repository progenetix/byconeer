The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672912/suppl/GSM672912_7484_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672912/suppl/GSM672912_7484_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.001417	AB	-0.124158	11.921125AFFX-2315061	AB	0.003233	AB	0.181393	10.932354AFFX-2315062	AB	0.001239	AB	-0.080209	10.293319AFFX-2315057	BB	0.010489	BB	-0.601889	10.610884AFFX-2315058	AB	0.000056	AB	0.157815	11.890778AFFX-2315059	AB	0.039664	AB	0.353740	10.726080AFFX-2315063	BB	0.002283	BB	-0.773209	10.963826AFFX-2315064	AB	0.179912	AB	0.384752	10.198997AFFX-2315065	AA	0.216587	AA	0.301094	10.211448AFFX-2315066	AB	0.029334	AB	-0.222988	10.215554AFFX-2315067	AB	0.008994	AB	0.094258	11.122111AFFX-2315068	AB	0.002088	AB	0.110524	10.582895AFFX-2315069	AA	0.015863	AA	0.693414	9.585626AFFX-2315070	AB	0.001811	AB	-0.027697	10.397686AFFX-2315071	AB	0.010095	AB	-0.050810	10.275405AFFX-2315072	AA	0.002973	AA	0.752036	11.208720AFFX-2315073	AA	0.005436	AA	0.799035	10.516953AFFX-2315074	BB	0.018267	BB	-0.481891	9.941927AFFX-2315075	AB	0.013677	AB	0.164675	11.627996AFFX-2315076	AB	0.002458	AB	-0.046571	11.154267!sample_table_end
