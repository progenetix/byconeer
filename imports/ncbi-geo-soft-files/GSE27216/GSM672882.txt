The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672882/suppl/GSM672882_1056_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672882/suppl/GSM672882_1056_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.005946	AA	0.635274	12.200881AFFX-2315061	BB	0.000745	BB	-0.780844	11.440799AFFX-2315062	AA	0.001933	AA	0.572438	10.351301AFFX-2315057	AB	0.057473	AB	-0.105122	10.707406AFFX-2315058	AA	0.011757	AA	0.726761	12.189407AFFX-2315059	AB	0.010388	AB	0.300774	10.825778AFFX-2315063	AA	0.010351	AA	0.779811	10.589624AFFX-2315064	AB	0.164600	AB	0.335487	10.148871AFFX-2315065	AA	0.015306	AA	0.497554	10.592807AFFX-2315066	BB	0.016708	BB	-0.681658	10.572315AFFX-2315067	BB	0.018161	BB	-0.530225	11.195102AFFX-2315068	AB	0.009974	AB	0.167210	10.620351AFFX-2315069	AB	0.058837	AB	-0.219279	9.963634AFFX-2315070	AA	0.068054	AA	0.383037	10.572480AFFX-2315071	BB	0.007467	BB	-0.813001	10.315938AFFX-2315072	AA	0.032839	AA	0.686269	11.150042AFFX-2315073	AA	0.021618	AA	0.756940	10.493289AFFX-2315074	BB	0.006462	BB	-0.406834	9.932350AFFX-2315075	AA	0.026424	AA	0.725024	11.736066AFFX-2315076	AB	0.022023	AB	0.046672	11.264641!sample_table_end
