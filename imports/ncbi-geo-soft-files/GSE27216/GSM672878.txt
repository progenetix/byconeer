The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672878/suppl/GSM672878_9609_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672878/suppl/GSM672878_9609_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.011754	AB	0.005641	12.179506AFFX-2315061	BB	0.011278	BB	-0.825366	10.976239AFFX-2315062	AB	0.035079	AB	-0.177006	10.882159AFFX-2315057	BB	0.017361	BB	-0.580207	11.055321AFFX-2315058	AA	0.165772	AA	0.787730	11.274720AFFX-2315059	AB	0.027490	AB	0.309740	10.440257AFFX-2315063	AA	0.001642	AA	0.769723	10.793846AFFX-2315064	AB	0.102738	AB	0.237361	10.589575AFFX-2315065	NC	0.966484	AB	-0.278555	10.504382AFFX-2315066	BB	0.064038	BB	-0.597277	10.406944AFFX-2315067	AB	0.037397	AB	0.092212	11.092012AFFX-2315068	AA	0.122437	AA	0.701659	10.406275AFFX-2315069	AB	0.040318	AB	0.002199	10.368710AFFX-2315070	AB	0.002850	AB	-0.127796	10.842276AFFX-2315071	AB	0.062018	AB	-0.248698	9.626066AFFX-2315072	AA	0.246864	AA	0.386754	11.043430AFFX-2315073	AB	0.112441	AB	0.221040	10.325537AFFX-2315074	BB	0.179866	BB	-0.469950	10.321386AFFX-2315075	AA	0.097198	AA	0.647945	11.557131AFFX-2315076	AA	0.074571	AA	0.416816	10.795979!sample_table_end
