The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672440/suppl/GSM672440_8960_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672440/suppl/GSM672440_8960_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.004204	AB	-0.122912	12.192461AFFX-2315061	AA	0.001857	AA	0.835257	11.172565AFFX-2315062	BB	0.009592	BB	-0.628357	10.665509AFFX-2315057	BB	0.012477	BB	-0.647345	10.963815AFFX-2315058	AA	0.038938	AA	0.639411	11.617167AFFX-2315059	AB	0.003362	AB	0.280532	10.614975AFFX-2315063	AB	0.008591	AB	-0.104658	10.992668AFFX-2315064	AA	0.000480	AA	0.794934	11.051158AFFX-2315065	AB	0.002262	AB	-0.028789	10.579993AFFX-2315066	BB	0.018645	BB	-0.689721	10.527071AFFX-2315067	BB	0.008023	BB	-0.512081	11.115214AFFX-2315068	AA	0.001166	AA	0.799006	10.882767AFFX-2315069	AB	0.014071	AB	-0.247782	10.792028AFFX-2315070	AB	0.003056	AB	-0.138408	10.851795AFFX-2315071	AA	0.001601	AA	0.628575	9.702592AFFX-2315072	AA	0.052330	AA	0.470990	10.818121AFFX-2315073	AA	0.009058	AA	0.778982	10.904554AFFX-2315074	AB	0.029408	AB	0.138561	10.379850AFFX-2315075	AB	0.027654	AB	-0.006770	11.601531AFFX-2315076	AB	0.037216	AB	-0.034854	10.850695!sample_table_end
