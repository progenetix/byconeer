The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672405/suppl/GSM672405_1511_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672405/suppl/GSM672405_1511_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.016514	BB	-0.659752	12.010596AFFX-2315061	AA	0.007239	AA	0.833482	11.063870AFFX-2315062	AA	0.006748	AA	0.561981	10.374507AFFX-2315057	AB	0.060430	AB	-0.222693	10.807223AFFX-2315058	AA	0.014656	AA	0.678152	11.314757AFFX-2315059	AB	0.003546	AB	0.196820	10.480708AFFX-2315063	AA	0.006410	AA	0.786007	10.661434AFFX-2315064	BB	0.005120	BB	-0.705108	10.671149AFFX-2315065	BB	0.105045	BB	-0.617743	10.496187AFFX-2315066	BB	0.022844	BB	-0.695661	10.556690AFFX-2315067	AB	0.009768	AB	0.000395	11.040735AFFX-2315068	AB	0.053546	AB	0.315367	10.785707AFFX-2315069	AB	0.008167	AB	-0.111866	10.763272AFFX-2315070	BB	0.022975	BB	-0.684937	10.762829AFFX-2315071	AB	0.002045	AB	-0.123104	9.717321AFFX-2315072	AA	0.009762	AA	0.568442	10.743388AFFX-2315073	AB	0.010285	AB	0.129277	10.767661AFFX-2315074	BB	0.015836	BB	-0.561977	10.365272AFFX-2315075	BB	0.008228	BB	-0.653177	11.473610AFFX-2315076	AB	0.055721	AB	-0.060107	10.835816!sample_table_end
