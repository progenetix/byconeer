The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672420/suppl/GSM672420_4821_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672420/suppl/GSM672420_4821_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.018280	AA	0.716055	12.107530AFFX-2315061	AA	0.013177	AA	0.851946	11.077214AFFX-2315062	AB	0.029813	AB	-0.168146	10.899125AFFX-2315057	AA	0.122228	AA	0.394635	10.980566AFFX-2315058	AB	0.032350	AB	0.255510	11.563806AFFX-2315059	AA	0.083466	AA	0.796316	10.480143AFFX-2315063	AA	0.026385	AA	0.760152	10.555087AFFX-2315064	BB	0.019501	BB	-0.647007	10.494456AFFX-2315065	AB	0.006877	AB	-0.008989	10.586601AFFX-2315066	BB	0.047437	BB	-0.603378	10.447707AFFX-2315067	AB	0.010389	AB	-0.024905	11.279242AFFX-2315068	AA	0.023037	AA	0.793479	10.644184AFFX-2315069	AB	0.032999	AB	0.050891	10.560268AFFX-2315070	BB	0.026026	BB	-0.641560	11.033051AFFX-2315071	BB	0.011695	BB	-0.727542	9.816649AFFX-2315072	AA	0.073883	AA	0.453779	11.069002AFFX-2315073	AB	0.046172	AB	0.278799	10.688895AFFX-2315074	BB	0.068554	BB	-0.562080	10.311562AFFX-2315075	AA	0.000725	AA	0.687181	11.774757AFFX-2315076	AB	0.112660	AB	0.058030	11.317463!sample_table_end
