The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672463/suppl/GSM672463_2894_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672463/suppl/GSM672463_2894_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.006643	AA	0.720509	11.780086AFFX-2315061	BB	0.000520	BB	-0.820914	10.833967AFFX-2315062	BB	0.004885	BB	-0.652130	10.207011AFFX-2315057	AB	0.001504	AB	-0.074786	10.553993AFFX-2315058	AA	0.004621	AA	0.768547	11.887120AFFX-2315059	BB	0.004433	BB	-0.773837	10.401986AFFX-2315063	AB	0.007639	AB	-0.085538	10.945048AFFX-2315064	AA	0.039397	AA	0.719944	10.285606AFFX-2315065	AA	0.002575	AA	0.500108	10.260990AFFX-2315066	BB	0.012990	BB	-0.705510	10.298289AFFX-2315067	BB	0.007908	BB	-0.634703	11.136174AFFX-2315068	AA	0.001178	AA	0.848083	10.649771AFFX-2315069	AB	0.000025	AB	-0.103545	9.892478AFFX-2315070	BB	0.020210	BB	-0.557351	10.451462AFFX-2315071	AA	0.009525	AA	0.728036	10.218328AFFX-2315072	AA	0.001433	AA	0.763279	11.204299AFFX-2315073	AB	0.001397	AB	0.116166	10.574102AFFX-2315074	BB	0.085761	BB	-0.397432	9.857044AFFX-2315075	AA	0.018775	AA	0.811684	11.557893AFFX-2315076	BB	0.000135	BB	-0.694586	11.107490!sample_table_end
