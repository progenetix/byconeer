The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672885/suppl/GSM672885_1780_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672885/suppl/GSM672885_1780_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.013324	AB	-0.026752	12.318228AFFX-2315061	AB	0.000753	AB	0.105099	11.735868AFFX-2315062	AA	0.044493	AA	0.699191	10.519975AFFX-2315057	AB	0.055878	AB	-0.146040	10.545842AFFX-2315058	AB	0.007503	AB	0.125105	12.383553AFFX-2315059	AA	0.108228	AA	0.738219	11.305397AFFX-2315063	AB	0.017136	AB	-0.165191	11.145923AFFX-2315064	AB	0.027224	AB	0.291926	10.340381AFFX-2315065	NC	0.511800	AB	-0.211093	10.632744AFFX-2315066	BB	0.078657	BB	-0.725099	10.846741AFFX-2315067	AB	0.042217	AB	-0.116305	11.661104AFFX-2315068	AA	0.019149	AA	0.857642	11.050464AFFX-2315069	AB	0.009595	AB	-0.071819	10.252594AFFX-2315070	AB	0.025503	AB	-0.137126	10.434491AFFX-2315071	AA	0.058528	AA	0.797145	10.673717AFFX-2315072	AB	0.038760	AB	0.080633	11.569355AFFX-2315073	AA	0.066533	AA	0.722466	11.005333AFFX-2315074	AA	0.083342	AA	0.553369	9.686357AFFX-2315075	AA	0.039126	AA	0.755345	11.807788AFFX-2315076	AB	0.069619	AB	-0.153603	11.300456!sample_table_end
