The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672865/suppl/GSM672865_7093_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672865/suppl/GSM672865_7093_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.007107	AA	0.691674	11.724989AFFX-2315061	AB	0.013543	AB	0.200450	10.786952AFFX-2315062	AA	0.015592	AA	0.469745	10.427514AFFX-2315057	AB	0.016783	AB	-0.184071	10.763741AFFX-2315058	AA	0.026588	AA	0.768209	11.260643AFFX-2315059	AB	0.025626	AB	0.267784	10.168490AFFX-2315063	AB	0.001401	AB	-0.047470	10.676302AFFX-2315064	BB	0.000315	BB	-0.689039	10.545141AFFX-2315065	AB	0.011495	AB	0.000870	10.288589AFFX-2315066	AB	0.000091	AB	0.028848	10.371372AFFX-2315067	AA	0.009627	AA	0.510599	10.930622AFFX-2315068	AA	0.008124	AA	0.733628	10.632754AFFX-2315069	AB	0.003250	AB	-0.082769	10.549520AFFX-2315070	AB	0.050047	AB	-0.208195	10.639661AFFX-2315071	AB	0.012617	AB	-0.131572	9.581853AFFX-2315072	AA	0.025746	AA	0.487144	10.604971AFFX-2315073	BB	0.008541	BB	-0.564947	10.308672AFFX-2315074	BB	0.002401	BB	-0.563525	10.232957AFFX-2315075	BB	0.001457	BB	-0.598271	11.385212AFFX-2315076	BB	0.015464	BB	-0.530683	10.743045!sample_table_end
