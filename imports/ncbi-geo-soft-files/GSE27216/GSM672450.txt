The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672450/suppl/GSM672450_1511_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672450/suppl/GSM672450_1511_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.004450	BB	-0.738317	11.960393AFFX-2315061	AA	0.006293	AA	0.855228	11.096706AFFX-2315062	AA	0.007831	AA	0.704982	10.299221AFFX-2315057	AB	0.010458	AB	-0.124554	10.464674AFFX-2315058	AA	0.042032	AA	0.720790	12.097400AFFX-2315059	AB	0.009965	AB	0.289446	10.837239AFFX-2315063	AA	0.000172	AA	0.810093	10.538740AFFX-2315064	BB	0.020772	BB	-0.411163	9.980885AFFX-2315065	BB	0.020966	BB	-0.557960	10.393053AFFX-2315066	BB	0.029364	BB	-0.721287	10.626318AFFX-2315067	AB	0.026097	AB	0.110467	11.375034AFFX-2315068	AB	0.001486	AB	0.084826	10.765570AFFX-2315069	AB	0.005804	AB	-0.034569	9.797373AFFX-2315070	BB	0.010019	BB	-0.566882	10.410002AFFX-2315071	AB	0.002446	AB	-0.149159	10.447832AFFX-2315072	AA	0.001978	AA	0.773938	11.183365AFFX-2315073	AB	0.001417	AB	0.151616	10.681073AFFX-2315074	BB	0.181371	BB	-0.357157	9.835396AFFX-2315075	BB	0.048189	BB	-0.593347	11.775556AFFX-2315076	AB	0.012660	AB	-0.083225	11.342533!sample_table_end
