The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672888/suppl/GSM672888_1815_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672888/suppl/GSM672888_1815_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.008399	BB	-0.689818	12.235394AFFX-2315061	AB	0.003663	AB	0.153359	11.613526AFFX-2315062	AA	0.003614	AA	0.562003	10.262867AFFX-2315057	AA	0.053863	AA	0.441907	10.374588AFFX-2315058	AA	0.005305	AA	0.693235	12.159247AFFX-2315059	AA	0.005038	AA	0.795734	10.896472AFFX-2315063	AA	0.009241	AA	0.796019	10.676116AFFX-2315064	AA	0.017994	AA	0.592115	10.109314AFFX-2315065	AB	0.011251	AB	-0.028755	10.475991AFFX-2315066	BB	0.004874	BB	-0.634517	10.428858AFFX-2315067	BB	0.047559	BB	-0.581738	11.077676AFFX-2315068	AB	0.022879	AB	-0.017515	10.672825AFFX-2315069	AB	0.016027	AB	-0.064764	10.163754AFFX-2315070	AB	0.004742	AB	-0.064729	10.446694AFFX-2315071	AB	0.012770	AB	-0.096844	10.102725AFFX-2315072	AA	0.094721	AA	0.741682	11.114699AFFX-2315073	BB	0.005389	BB	-0.650975	10.423982AFFX-2315074	AB	0.041176	AB	0.187650	9.903014AFFX-2315075	AA	0.024126	AA	0.719430	11.707996AFFX-2315076	AA	0.000854	AA	0.530540	11.069736!sample_table_end
