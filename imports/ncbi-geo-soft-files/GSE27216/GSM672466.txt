The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672466/suppl/GSM672466_4821_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672466/suppl/GSM672466_4821_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.001600	AA	0.617646	12.328727AFFX-2315061	AA	0.003017	AA	0.842897	11.539838AFFX-2315062	AB	0.053944	AB	-0.153133	10.280540AFFX-2315057	AA	0.010547	AA	0.356161	10.540032AFFX-2315058	AB	0.010171	AB	0.214246	12.304489AFFX-2315059	AA	0.005837	AA	0.781736	11.056638AFFX-2315063	AA	0.022454	AA	0.727386	10.441808AFFX-2315064	BB	0.431072	BB	-0.153502	10.142391AFFX-2315065	AB	0.018092	AB	-0.020248	10.704704AFFX-2315066	BB	0.130530	BB	-0.535007	10.596779AFFX-2315067	AB	0.120671	AB	0.171256	11.227327AFFX-2315068	AA	0.005502	AA	0.817653	10.866789AFFX-2315069	AB	0.012683	AB	-0.033546	10.434999AFFX-2315070	BB	0.108094	BB	-0.453685	10.741004AFFX-2315071	BB	0.084904	BB	-0.714875	10.129374AFFX-2315072	AA	0.056872	AA	0.559599	10.918543AFFX-2315073	AB	0.022167	AB	0.167466	10.220818AFFX-2315074	BB	0.432821	BB	-0.224188	9.918883AFFX-2315075	AA	0.064425	AA	0.670844	11.248108AFFX-2315076	AB	0.002060	AB	0.012549	11.157729!sample_table_end
