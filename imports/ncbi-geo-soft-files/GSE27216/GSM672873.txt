The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672873/suppl/GSM672873_7581_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672873/suppl/GSM672873_7581_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.001279	AB	-0.085613	11.831935AFFX-2315061	BB	0.003423	BB	-0.749197	10.727776AFFX-2315062	AB	0.015816	AB	-0.035399	10.428489AFFX-2315057	BB	0.002666	BB	-0.590592	10.781940AFFX-2315058	AB	0.005651	AB	0.203309	11.151190AFFX-2315059	AB	0.002777	AB	0.267786	10.346148AFFX-2315063	AB	0.004716	AB	-0.115765	10.845702AFFX-2315064	BB	0.004711	BB	-0.711626	10.663774AFFX-2315065	BB	0.316092	BB	-0.345414	10.427591AFFX-2315066	AB	0.003637	AB	0.021277	10.472111AFFX-2315067	AB	0.007763	AB	0.098291	10.961934AFFX-2315068	AA	0.002546	AA	0.785800	10.647980AFFX-2315069	BB	0.004467	BB	-0.840014	10.658963AFFX-2315070	BB	0.017277	BB	-0.611329	10.691384AFFX-2315071	BB	0.000296	BB	-0.712434	9.820045AFFX-2315072	AB	0.003683	AB	-0.041245	10.667581AFFX-2315073	AA	0.008675	AA	0.713280	10.643066AFFX-2315074	AB	0.006153	AB	0.115400	10.312501AFFX-2315075	AB	0.007964	AB	0.127781	11.411430AFFX-2315076	AA	0.007333	AA	0.478737	10.682163!sample_table_end
