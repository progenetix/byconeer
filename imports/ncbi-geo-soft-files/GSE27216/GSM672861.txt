The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672861/suppl/GSM672861_6428_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672861/suppl/GSM672861_6428_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.016210	AB	-0.058829	12.315386AFFX-2315061	AB	0.020693	AB	0.163690	11.463276AFFX-2315062	AA	0.004522	AA	0.621619	10.707761AFFX-2315057	AB	0.005181	AB	-0.178148	10.895386AFFX-2315058	AA	0.179613	AA	0.648102	11.950303AFFX-2315059	AB	0.015081	AB	0.289713	10.702439AFFX-2315063	AA	0.010427	AA	0.761209	10.896476AFFX-2315064	AB	0.003176	AB	0.191304	11.103024AFFX-2315065	AA	0.015745	AA	0.523613	10.453285AFFX-2315066	AB	0.005982	AB	0.080240	10.734565AFFX-2315067	BB	0.023350	BB	-0.592467	11.249068AFFX-2315068	BB	0.005382	BB	-0.666728	10.923841AFFX-2315069	BB	0.009203	BB	-0.835240	10.876159AFFX-2315070	AB	0.005775	AB	-0.154099	10.849927AFFX-2315071	AB	0.017737	AB	-0.177845	10.142295AFFX-2315072	AA	0.004566	AA	0.543095	10.993883AFFX-2315073	AA	0.047582	AA	0.666729	10.880407AFFX-2315074	AB	0.010098	AB	0.106507	10.632679AFFX-2315075	AA	0.016710	AA	0.708690	11.895721AFFX-2315076	AB	0.036041	AB	0.080946	11.112438!sample_table_end
