The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672439/suppl/GSM672439_8612_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672439/suppl/GSM672439_8612_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.003050	AB	-0.062246	11.804416AFFX-2315061	AA	0.004038	AA	0.840057	10.881270AFFX-2315062	BB	0.040940	BB	-0.575126	10.586993AFFX-2315057	BB	0.003756	BB	-0.633869	10.853699AFFX-2315058	AA	0.004272	AA	0.723921	11.197240AFFX-2315059	AB	0.000410	AB	0.243925	10.377810AFFX-2315063	AB	0.006560	AB	-0.035141	10.914594AFFX-2315064	BB	0.000830	BB	-0.703766	10.543089AFFX-2315065	AB	0.028968	AB	-0.081415	10.439685AFFX-2315066	BB	0.003434	BB	-0.626170	10.309697AFFX-2315067	BB	0.024613	BB	-0.436724	10.904371AFFX-2315068	AB	0.006343	AB	0.140492	10.469239AFFX-2315069	AB	0.006924	AB	-0.108032	10.415139AFFX-2315070	AB	0.011531	AB	-0.004541	10.638016AFFX-2315071	BB	0.010731	BB	-0.767668	9.879377AFFX-2315072	AA	0.009534	AA	0.555503	10.804567AFFX-2315073	AB	0.013195	AB	0.228836	10.456559AFFX-2315074	BB	0.000481	BB	-0.575012	10.274421AFFX-2315075	AA	0.152663	AA	0.573676	11.703194AFFX-2315076	AB	0.021650	AB	0.102292	10.698018!sample_table_end
