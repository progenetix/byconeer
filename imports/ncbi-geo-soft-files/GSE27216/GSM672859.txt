The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672859/suppl/GSM672859_5993_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672859/suppl/GSM672859_5993_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.011041	AB	-0.146077	12.109460AFFX-2315061	AB	0.005682	AB	0.117542	11.132889AFFX-2315062	BB	0.022737	BB	-0.592277	10.613982AFFX-2315057	AA	0.027066	AA	0.525383	10.540125AFFX-2315058	AA	0.015712	AA	0.712147	11.693211AFFX-2315059	AA	0.013521	AA	0.773932	10.588840AFFX-2315063	AA	0.007719	AA	0.766309	10.674187AFFX-2315064	AB	0.003203	AB	0.194292	11.112507AFFX-2315065	AB	0.006753	AB	-0.040745	10.639912AFFX-2315066	BB	0.003277	BB	-0.633798	10.650280AFFX-2315067	AB	0.001565	AB	0.018565	11.211443AFFX-2315068	BB	0.002436	BB	-0.663742	10.724740AFFX-2315069	AB	0.000850	AB	-0.150416	10.791839AFFX-2315070	AA	0.031040	AA	0.639357	10.492100AFFX-2315071	BB	0.022575	BB	-0.772574	9.910840AFFX-2315072	AB	0.018231	AB	-0.135813	10.892031AFFX-2315073	AB	0.018474	AB	0.088819	10.650957AFFX-2315074	AB	0.012948	AB	0.051487	10.364099AFFX-2315075	AB	0.032031	AB	0.148614	11.509151AFFX-2315076	AA	0.039541	AA	0.471161	10.754859!sample_table_end
