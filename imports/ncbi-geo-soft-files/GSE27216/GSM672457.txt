The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672457/suppl/GSM672457_2377_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672457/suppl/GSM672457_2377_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.029874	AB	0.014360	12.130404AFFX-2315061	AB	0.007724	AB	0.106806	10.804499AFFX-2315062	AA	0.001870	AA	0.614431	10.110452AFFX-2315057	AA	0.068041	AA	0.421908	10.416081AFFX-2315058	AA	0.020205	AA	0.821532	11.896512AFFX-2315059	AA	0.006961	AA	0.846146	10.795674AFFX-2315063	AA	0.014648	AA	0.810488	10.307870AFFX-2315064	AB	0.002238	AB	0.290282	10.046662AFFX-2315065	BB	0.361182	BB	-0.357595	10.452408AFFX-2315066	BB	0.003935	BB	-0.689350	10.450300AFFX-2315067	AA	0.032612	AA	0.537090	11.068336AFFX-2315068	AB	0.004961	AB	0.055674	10.595106AFFX-2315069	AB	0.013691	AB	-0.030771	9.636689AFFX-2315070	BB	0.010138	BB	-0.580594	10.473484AFFX-2315071	AB	0.013978	AB	-0.234320	10.096453AFFX-2315072	AB	0.003042	AB	0.139551	11.140889AFFX-2315073	BB	0.005275	BB	-0.724259	10.376451AFFX-2315074	AB	0.051544	AB	0.211016	9.771591AFFX-2315075	AB	0.002239	AB	0.103523	11.675614AFFX-2315076	AB	0.001544	AB	0.028370	11.231657!sample_table_end
