The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672895/suppl/GSM672895_3094_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672895/suppl/GSM672895_3094_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.001259	AA	0.598850	12.209942AFFX-2315061	BB	0.000319	BB	-0.782741	11.565336AFFX-2315062	AB	0.029216	AB	0.033806	10.616343AFFX-2315057	NC	0.672323	BB	-0.270513	10.399913AFFX-2315058	AA	0.000629	AA	0.702809	12.228904AFFX-2315059	AA	0.027513	AA	0.790638	11.183575AFFX-2315063	AB	0.017337	AB	-0.194627	11.086176AFFX-2315064	BB	0.024628	BB	-0.449351	9.987648AFFX-2315065	AA	0.011551	AA	0.406465	10.489771AFFX-2315066	BB	0.012437	BB	-0.668483	10.599865AFFX-2315067	BB	0.028692	BB	-0.606714	11.443748AFFX-2315068	AA	0.002874	AA	0.813893	10.934135AFFX-2315069	AB	0.026714	AB	-0.232619	10.197704AFFX-2315070	BB	0.018673	BB	-0.589008	10.719214AFFX-2315071	AB	0.003103	AB	-0.128685	10.551878AFFX-2315072	AB	0.017624	AB	-0.021593	11.370019AFFX-2315073	AB	0.028352	AB	0.019384	10.878983AFFX-2315074	BB	0.007540	BB	-0.438459	9.951352AFFX-2315075	AA	0.028077	AA	0.707350	11.822474AFFX-2315076	AB	0.008734	AB	0.028041	11.212131!sample_table_end
