The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672478/suppl/GSM672478_8160_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672478/suppl/GSM672478_8160_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.000758	AB	-0.081399	11.957084AFFX-2315061	AB	0.003249	AB	0.156320	11.142260AFFX-2315062	AB	0.002994	AB	-0.044700	10.442142AFFX-2315057	AB	0.017010	AB	-0.034859	10.362039AFFX-2315058	AA	0.085438	AA	0.680341	12.041352AFFX-2315059	AA	0.006008	AA	0.785141	10.797810AFFX-2315063	BB	0.003031	BB	-0.781946	11.017043AFFX-2315064	AB	0.031133	AB	0.331325	10.108950AFFX-2315065	AA	0.007784	AA	0.523069	10.256429AFFX-2315066	BB	0.006157	BB	-0.706173	10.338274AFFX-2315067	BB	0.000167	BB	-0.609602	10.991889AFFX-2315068	AB	0.002725	AB	0.177482	10.785132AFFX-2315069	AA	0.004467	AA	0.698357	9.899168AFFX-2315070	BB	0.002820	BB	-0.618977	10.360993AFFX-2315071	AB	0.006748	AB	-0.209095	10.505736AFFX-2315072	AA	0.007171	AA	0.777655	11.101828AFFX-2315073	AB	0.013315	AB	-0.006952	10.789227AFFX-2315074	AB	0.031413	AB	0.191162	9.823268AFFX-2315075	AA	0.003164	AA	0.749233	11.576824AFFX-2315076	BB	0.001341	BB	-0.713386	11.147886!sample_table_end
