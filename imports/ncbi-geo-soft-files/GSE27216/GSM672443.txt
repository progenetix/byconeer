The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672443/suppl/GSM672443_8994_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672443/suppl/GSM672443_8994_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.158380	AB	-0.261993	12.001595AFFX-2315061	AB	0.016511	AB	0.204520	11.161102AFFX-2315062	AA	0.055431	AA	0.558869	10.434676AFFX-2315057	AB	0.036840	AB	-0.222825	10.853307AFFX-2315058	AB	0.021871	AB	0.014287	11.339329AFFX-2315059	AA	0.278398	AA	0.773363	10.213586AFFX-2315063	AA	0.046165	AA	0.784714	10.467794AFFX-2315064	AB	0.022753	AB	0.278642	10.866704AFFX-2315065	AB	0.063168	AB	0.010634	10.392474AFFX-2315066	BB	0.046299	BB	-0.697939	10.419709AFFX-2315067	AB	0.081361	AB	0.042448	10.968307AFFX-2315068	AB	0.052727	AB	0.245519	10.590666AFFX-2315069	AA	0.016235	AA	0.821480	10.456161AFFX-2315070	BB	0.050206	BB	-0.658966	10.613732AFFX-2315071	AB	0.070783	AB	-0.289248	9.727611AFFX-2315072	AA	0.057187	AA	0.505457	10.760793AFFX-2315073	AB	0.069048	AB	0.133361	10.371009AFFX-2315074	BB	0.312161	BB	-0.452743	10.140491AFFX-2315075	AA	0.016418	AA	0.725729	11.858329AFFX-2315076	BB	0.010853	BB	-0.520961	10.857340!sample_table_end
