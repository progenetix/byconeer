The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672843/suppl/GSM672843_1815_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672843/suppl/GSM672843_1815_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.027510	AB	-0.179759	12.215816AFFX-2315061	AA	0.001997	AA	0.831799	11.261792AFFX-2315062	AB	0.004950	AB	-0.019174	10.836437AFFX-2315057	AA	0.002221	AA	0.496793	10.776133AFFX-2315058	AA	0.076679	AA	0.736538	11.348802AFFX-2315059	AB	0.010507	AB	0.260086	10.469503AFFX-2315063	AB	0.015840	AB	-0.070149	10.843842AFFX-2315064	AB	0.001912	AB	0.221606	10.993915AFFX-2315065	AA	0.084017	AA	0.367309	10.570336AFFX-2315066	BB	0.007059	BB	-0.654699	10.786943AFFX-2315067	AB	0.099681	AB	0.174387	11.307336AFFX-2315068	AB	0.021392	AB	0.282741	10.825274AFFX-2315069	AA	0.001734	AA	0.779050	10.669101AFFX-2315070	AA	0.009647	AA	0.664523	10.890464AFFX-2315071	AB	0.003161	AB	-0.145725	9.806725AFFX-2315072	AA	0.008446	AA	0.499242	10.996799AFFX-2315073	BB	0.006044	BB	-0.635527	10.740959AFFX-2315074	AA	0.002221	AA	0.724325	10.277333AFFX-2315075	AB	0.003282	AB	0.064613	11.771206AFFX-2315076	AB	0.027897	AB	0.108138	10.997297!sample_table_end
