The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672901/suppl/GSM672901_3921_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672901/suppl/GSM672901_3921_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.003268	AA	0.660484	11.939367AFFX-2315061	AB	0.007660	AB	0.164773	11.214440AFFX-2315062	AA	0.009005	AA	0.707172	10.320491AFFX-2315057	BB	0.000302	BB	-0.559220	10.489407AFFX-2315058	AA	0.025699	AA	0.714950	11.992419AFFX-2315059	AB	0.000746	AB	0.207627	10.764020AFFX-2315063	AB	0.001717	AB	-0.154134	10.949863AFFX-2315064	AB	0.181316	AB	0.388379	10.144679AFFX-2315065	BB	0.042731	BB	-0.578316	10.286863AFFX-2315066	AB	0.000700	AB	-0.091704	10.432155AFFX-2315067	AA	0.000596	AA	0.608115	11.223111AFFX-2315068	AB	0.000359	AB	0.146382	10.734385AFFX-2315069	BB	0.003223	BB	-0.787744	9.979014AFFX-2315070	BB	0.015791	BB	-0.643060	10.313681AFFX-2315071	AB	0.003029	AB	-0.168995	10.470879AFFX-2315072	AB	0.000180	AB	0.067096	11.139312AFFX-2315073	AB	0.004836	AB	0.044075	10.790162AFFX-2315074	BB	0.004901	BB	-0.472556	9.851625AFFX-2315075	AA	0.033456	AA	0.727307	11.722745AFFX-2315076	AB	0.010024	AB	-0.094896	11.187957!sample_table_end
