The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672480/suppl/GSM672480_8327_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672480/suppl/GSM672480_8327_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.002244	AB	-0.125930	12.019790AFFX-2315061	BB	0.004059	BB	-0.850720	10.852845AFFX-2315062	AB	0.005572	AB	-0.098195	10.241327AFFX-2315057	AA	0.010125	AA	0.480521	10.353690AFFX-2315058	AB	0.028285	AB	0.278526	12.048299AFFX-2315059	BB	0.001358	BB	-0.774807	10.489038AFFX-2315063	AB	0.036636	AB	-0.289126	10.846198AFFX-2315064	AB	0.020456	AB	0.224713	10.029574AFFX-2315065	AB	0.001339	AB	-0.081232	10.397987AFFX-2315066	BB	0.002058	BB	-0.686486	10.387578AFFX-2315067	BB	0.002447	BB	-0.641550	11.013523AFFX-2315068	AA	0.003676	AA	0.843816	10.802360AFFX-2315069	AB	0.006119	AB	-0.025100	9.930542AFFX-2315070	BB	0.034415	BB	-0.619416	10.607200AFFX-2315071	AA	0.003907	AA	0.813702	10.270988AFFX-2315072	AA	0.032548	AA	0.753428	11.370191AFFX-2315073	AB	0.001796	AB	0.154341	10.698166AFFX-2315074	AB	0.082732	AB	0.238864	9.867876AFFX-2315075	AB	0.015036	AB	0.162589	11.751950AFFX-2315076	BB	0.009524	BB	-0.741383	11.247529!sample_table_end
