The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672475/suppl/GSM672475_8135_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672475/suppl/GSM672475_8135_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.000889	BB	-0.750369	11.912951AFFX-2315061	AB	0.008967	AB	0.139609	11.257455AFFX-2315062	AB	0.019552	AB	-0.079471	10.107360AFFX-2315057	BB	0.037653	BB	-0.490602	10.289176AFFX-2315058	AA	0.087128	AA	0.685744	11.736678AFFX-2315059	AB	0.017271	AB	0.152784	10.575045AFFX-2315063	AB	0.003148	AB	-0.172381	10.749960AFFX-2315064	AB	0.173032	AB	0.293560	9.740026AFFX-2315065	AA	0.042188	AA	0.499236	9.997779AFFX-2315066	BB	0.129847	BB	-0.696092	10.001308AFFX-2315067	AB	0.007138	AB	0.074489	11.095684AFFX-2315068	AA	0.046739	AA	0.796215	10.317382AFFX-2315069	AA	0.000050	AA	0.696679	9.798104AFFX-2315070	AA	0.032790	AA	0.472889	10.108699AFFX-2315071	AB	0.012290	AB	-0.127653	10.014851AFFX-2315072	AA	0.055059	AA	0.727243	10.850668AFFX-2315073	AA	0.029660	AA	0.747090	10.329372AFFX-2315074	BB	0.091614	BB	-0.386525	9.632619AFFX-2315075	AB	0.005449	AB	0.011361	11.640066AFFX-2315076	BB	0.032177	BB	-0.678799	10.793462!sample_table_end
