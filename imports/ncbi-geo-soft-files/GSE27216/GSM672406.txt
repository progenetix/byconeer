The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672406/suppl/GSM672406_1511_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672406/suppl/GSM672406_1511_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.007163	AB	-0.055527	11.966517AFFX-2315061	BB	0.003721	BB	-0.778814	10.873599AFFX-2315062	BB	0.034170	BB	-0.567906	10.403364AFFX-2315057	BB	0.010204	BB	-0.653356	10.784243AFFX-2315058	AB	0.005722	AB	0.108771	11.117155AFFX-2315059	AA	0.011972	AA	0.779401	10.546770AFFX-2315063	BB	0.004667	BB	-0.758125	10.966893AFFX-2315064	AA	0.051980	AA	0.809125	11.006392AFFX-2315065	BB	0.001481	BB	-0.474728	10.355402AFFX-2315066	AA	0.023498	AA	0.749710	10.520645AFFX-2315067	AB	0.013401	AB	0.048277	11.114355AFFX-2315068	AA	0.012409	AA	0.793149	10.527660AFFX-2315069	AA	0.003311	AA	0.772350	10.540040AFFX-2315070	AB	0.003393	AB	-0.097815	10.658858AFFX-2315071	BB	0.018761	BB	-0.779267	9.805353AFFX-2315072	AA	0.006546	AA	0.549007	10.671157AFFX-2315073	AA	0.006153	AA	0.737064	10.637165AFFX-2315074	BB	0.007989	BB	-0.613675	10.359813AFFX-2315075	AB	0.110004	AB	-0.108905	11.210348AFFX-2315076	BB	0.017309	BB	-0.532638	10.750840!sample_table_end
