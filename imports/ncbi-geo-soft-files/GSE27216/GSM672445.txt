The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672445/suppl/GSM672445_8994_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672445/suppl/GSM672445_8994_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.033508	BB	-0.622680	12.324132AFFX-2315061	AA	0.008209	AA	0.864228	11.295448AFFX-2315062	AB	0.088715	AB	0.042535	10.585177AFFX-2315057	AB	0.049042	AB	-0.226607	11.064360AFFX-2315058	AB	0.007551	AB	0.068206	11.433196AFFX-2315059	AB	0.004185	AB	0.258334	10.649055AFFX-2315063	AA	0.007214	AA	0.836703	10.855300AFFX-2315064	AB	0.004198	AB	0.182337	11.101835AFFX-2315065	AB	0.008006	AB	-0.061485	10.646449AFFX-2315066	BB	0.002678	BB	-0.650378	10.619584AFFX-2315067	AA	0.006576	AA	0.486294	11.222915AFFX-2315068	BB	0.009799	BB	-0.674932	10.647760AFFX-2315069	AA	0.001180	AA	0.787863	10.662615AFFX-2315070	BB	0.011937	BB	-0.644585	10.783417AFFX-2315071	BB	0.031719	BB	-0.762879	10.088220AFFX-2315072	AA	0.009744	AA	0.492624	10.983711AFFX-2315073	AA	0.043455	AA	0.732858	10.671054AFFX-2315074	BB	0.011203	BB	-0.559501	10.516267AFFX-2315075	AA	0.065312	AA	0.693016	12.013023AFFX-2315076	BB	0.051649	BB	-0.393070	10.897985!sample_table_end
