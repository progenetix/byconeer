The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672460/suppl/GSM672460_2569_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672460/suppl/GSM672460_2569_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.001095	AB	-0.103854	12.401801AFFX-2315061	BB	0.013662	BB	-0.830895	11.305984AFFX-2315062	BB	0.073251	BB	-0.647553	10.775176AFFX-2315057	BB	0.050282	BB	-0.422711	10.735648AFFX-2315058	AA	0.026118	AA	0.746894	12.375402AFFX-2315059	NC	0.633646	AB	0.520069	11.156289AFFX-2315063	NC	0.919087	AA	0.558077	11.255153AFFX-2315064	AB	0.043657	AB	0.214573	10.360635AFFX-2315065	AB	0.023980	AB	0.027913	10.665146AFFX-2315066	BB	0.183144	BB	-0.546419	10.747494AFFX-2315067	NC	0.554094	BB	-0.430578	11.521982AFFX-2315068	AA	0.119161	AA	0.696445	11.126863AFFX-2315069	AB	0.020604	AB	-0.144730	10.068202AFFX-2315070	BB	0.395097	BB	-0.387387	10.724465AFFX-2315071	NC	0.669520	AA	0.547993	10.817183AFFX-2315072	AB	0.202330	AB	-0.313331	11.685890AFFX-2315073	AB	0.379839	AB	0.435193	11.196466AFFX-2315074	BB	0.033472	BB	-0.521907	10.057815AFFX-2315075	AA	0.063776	AA	0.778347	12.030806AFFX-2315076	AB	0.109676	AB	0.042546	11.638808!sample_table_end
