The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672872/suppl/GSM672872_7581_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672872/suppl/GSM672872_7581_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.001429	AB	-0.062434	11.909744AFFX-2315061	BB	0.013841	BB	-0.795443	10.984760AFFX-2315062	AB	0.018226	AB	-0.001097	10.527005AFFX-2315057	BB	0.009652	BB	-0.625809	10.898436AFFX-2315058	AB	0.022916	AB	0.196194	11.303266AFFX-2315059	AB	0.003550	AB	0.265215	10.449480AFFX-2315063	AB	0.008354	AB	-0.134811	10.852759AFFX-2315064	BB	0.002099	BB	-0.718933	10.577012AFFX-2315065	AB	0.027569	AB	-0.103346	10.396044AFFX-2315066	BB	0.014915	BB	-0.656001	10.537945AFFX-2315067	AB	0.001892	AB	0.056521	11.035660AFFX-2315068	AA	0.016379	AA	0.776458	10.749536AFFX-2315069	AB	0.010176	AB	-0.058521	10.727983AFFX-2315070	AB	0.028027	AB	-0.161803	10.709474AFFX-2315071	BB	0.000084	BB	-0.714954	9.813615AFFX-2315072	AB	0.007046	AB	-0.098005	10.707900AFFX-2315073	AA	0.040210	AA	0.678768	10.683681AFFX-2315074	AB	0.012138	AB	0.100254	10.416331AFFX-2315075	AB	0.001309	AB	0.102295	11.495333AFFX-2315076	AB	0.034426	AB	-0.061096	10.730703!sample_table_end
