The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672894/suppl/GSM672894_3094_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672894/suppl/GSM672894_3094_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.007636	AB	-0.098011	12.220621AFFX-2315061	AA	0.007866	AA	0.887816	11.530933AFFX-2315062	AB	0.128524	AB	-0.174228	10.151071AFFX-2315057	AB	0.476600	AB	-0.145661	10.080397AFFX-2315058	BB	0.013343	BB	-0.860020	11.862171AFFX-2315059	AB	0.027907	AB	0.305431	11.109315AFFX-2315063	AA	0.044353	AA	0.806802	10.483287AFFX-2315064	AB	0.430954	AB	0.392675	10.302615AFFX-2315065	AB	0.466137	AB	0.113037	10.187105AFFX-2315066	AB	0.017685	AB	-0.033570	10.189603AFFX-2315067	BB	0.096996	BB	-0.692653	11.233907AFFX-2315068	AB	0.011593	AB	0.149343	10.575327AFFX-2315069	AB	0.096482	AB	-0.251602	9.905775AFFX-2315070	BB	0.060454	BB	-0.563623	10.401175AFFX-2315071	AB	0.014168	AB	-0.089489	10.088987AFFX-2315072	AB	0.149401	AB	0.305885	11.292134AFFX-2315073	BB	0.025283	BB	-0.716316	10.609990AFFX-2315074	BB	0.115894	BB	-0.451336	9.636981AFFX-2315075	AB	0.147393	AB	0.239546	11.711568AFFX-2315076	AB	0.014750	AB	-0.017534	11.316594!sample_table_end
