The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672848/suppl/GSM672848_2714_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672848/suppl/GSM672848_2714_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.001176	AB	-0.060974	12.140439AFFX-2315061	BB	0.002990	BB	-0.826433	11.131765AFFX-2315062	AA	0.007709	AA	0.546787	10.761564AFFX-2315057	BB	0.001440	BB	-0.619736	10.987953AFFX-2315058	AA	0.004986	AA	0.708766	11.623605AFFX-2315059	AA	0.000542	AA	0.758678	10.631261AFFX-2315063	BB	0.001227	BB	-0.717208	11.074221AFFX-2315064	BB	0.005706	BB	-0.672949	10.924532AFFX-2315065	BB	0.067444	BB	-0.405286	10.586518AFFX-2315066	BB	0.004064	BB	-0.672672	10.764924AFFX-2315067	BB	0.029744	BB	-0.533666	11.039936AFFX-2315068	BB	0.003650	BB	-0.681727	10.724491AFFX-2315069	AB	0.005026	AB	-0.063401	10.764843AFFX-2315070	BB	0.029706	BB	-0.743183	10.747781AFFX-2315071	BB	0.009069	BB	-0.747187	9.994020AFFX-2315072	AA	0.016544	AA	0.574644	10.912029AFFX-2315073	BB	0.005594	BB	-0.628527	10.735114AFFX-2315074	AB	0.006175	AB	0.096742	10.597569AFFX-2315075	AB	0.001205	AB	0.147253	11.726012AFFX-2315076	BB	0.005775	BB	-0.509896	10.871942!sample_table_end
