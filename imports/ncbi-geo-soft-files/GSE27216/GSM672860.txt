The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672860/suppl/GSM672860_6428_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672860/suppl/GSM672860_6428_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.010151	AB	-0.072430	12.281450AFFX-2315061	AA	0.013759	AA	0.822805	11.375536AFFX-2315062	AB	0.051094	AB	-0.151929	10.665478AFFX-2315057	AB	0.041191	AB	-0.150368	10.740719AFFX-2315058	AB	0.017405	AB	0.056810	11.552627AFFX-2315059	BB	0.015806	BB	-0.638397	10.536571AFFX-2315063	AB	0.008525	AB	-0.037387	10.877296AFFX-2315064	AB	0.016778	AB	0.268937	10.886984AFFX-2315065	AA	0.004524	AA	0.469105	10.417450AFFX-2315066	AA	0.011548	AA	0.731022	10.587927AFFX-2315067	AB	0.011127	AB	0.047812	11.134220AFFX-2315068	AB	0.000807	AB	0.161589	10.837039AFFX-2315069	BB	0.003650	BB	-0.844592	10.833518AFFX-2315070	AB	0.012322	AB	-0.123317	10.770784AFFX-2315071	AB	0.033609	AB	-0.253074	9.790230AFFX-2315072	AA	0.018184	AA	0.535338	10.842994AFFX-2315073	AB	0.004979	AB	0.218817	10.858837AFFX-2315074	AB	0.048166	AB	0.207448	10.537653AFFX-2315075	AA	0.047430	AA	0.625760	11.832763AFFX-2315076	AB	0.026886	AB	0.072552	10.817380!sample_table_end
