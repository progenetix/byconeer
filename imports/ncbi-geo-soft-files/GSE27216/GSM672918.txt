The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672918/suppl/GSM672918_7581_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672918/suppl/GSM672918_7581_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.014329	AB	-0.129128	11.780838AFFX-2315061	BB	0.028833	BB	-0.830975	11.255905AFFX-2315062	AB	0.100124	AB	-0.157552	9.939251AFFX-2315057	BB	0.108759	BB	-0.452271	10.160977AFFX-2315058	AB	0.031659	AB	0.206248	11.567022AFFX-2315059	AB	0.047823	AB	0.215583	10.332867AFFX-2315063	AB	0.037737	AB	-0.013803	10.486084AFFX-2315064	BB	0.023056	BB	-0.411069	9.663150AFFX-2315065	BB	0.009683	BB	-0.519579	10.281199AFFX-2315066	AB	0.048505	AB	-0.080249	9.943049AFFX-2315067	AB	0.052321	AB	0.031215	10.871662AFFX-2315068	AA	0.019377	AA	0.803435	10.463918AFFX-2315069	BB	0.005271	BB	-0.755757	9.787107AFFX-2315070	BB	0.115634	BB	-0.531192	10.137950AFFX-2315071	BB	0.032049	BB	-0.791732	10.005935AFFX-2315072	AB	0.045246	AB	0.007524	10.674257AFFX-2315073	AA	0.089903	AA	0.743323	10.087579AFFX-2315074	AB	0.168649	AB	0.216146	9.489793AFFX-2315075	AB	0.052848	AB	0.041172	11.112168AFFX-2315076	AA	0.062503	AA	0.558833	10.788541!sample_table_end
