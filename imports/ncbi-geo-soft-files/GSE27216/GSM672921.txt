The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672921/suppl/GSM672921_9390_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672921/suppl/GSM672921_9390_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.005453	AA	0.653236	11.955233AFFX-2315061	BB	0.002199	BB	-0.785107	10.893521AFFX-2315062	AB	0.001889	AB	-0.062768	10.269575AFFX-2315057	BB	0.019138	BB	-0.499258	10.377166AFFX-2315058	AA	0.012469	AA	0.745188	12.048301AFFX-2315059	AA	0.001819	AA	0.811540	10.892261AFFX-2315063	AA	0.000063	AA	0.801613	10.530724AFFX-2315064	AB	0.000032	AB	0.279307	10.068852AFFX-2315065	AA	0.023543	AA	0.411556	10.344109AFFX-2315066	BB	0.010777	BB	-0.670673	10.415404AFFX-2315067	BB	0.005536	BB	-0.590102	10.911660AFFX-2315068	AA	0.001726	AA	0.827319	10.640167AFFX-2315069	AA	0.014731	AA	0.628805	9.686799AFFX-2315070	BB	0.006614	BB	-0.590470	10.470190AFFX-2315071	AB	0.009141	AB	-0.251277	10.310387AFFX-2315072	AA	0.004514	AA	0.778418	11.138179AFFX-2315073	AB	0.006829	AB	0.189557	10.575661AFFX-2315074	AB	0.013257	AB	0.150964	9.755323AFFX-2315075	AA	0.005012	AA	0.745730	11.599115AFFX-2315076	BB	0.008652	BB	-0.747105	11.152255!sample_table_end
