The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672414/suppl/GSM672414_2569_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672414/suppl/GSM672414_2569_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.003241	AB	-0.122644	12.149369AFFX-2315061	BB	0.001319	BB	-0.805254	11.081725AFFX-2315062	AB	0.026114	AB	-0.059480	10.643412AFFX-2315057	BB	0.009421	BB	-0.656214	11.095796AFFX-2315058	AA	0.008178	AA	0.718188	11.557095AFFX-2315059	BB	0.059373	BB	-0.544670	10.157843AFFX-2315063	AB	0.009521	AB	0.067107	10.936233AFFX-2315064	AA	0.002876	AA	0.781243	11.059488AFFX-2315065	BB	0.016335	BB	-0.441856	10.619738AFFX-2315066	AB	0.001589	AB	-0.001789	10.671398AFFX-2315067	NC	0.565395	AB	0.201028	10.825766AFFX-2315068	AB	0.042637	AB	0.096018	10.570408AFFX-2315069	AB	0.015763	AB	-0.158543	10.518996AFFX-2315070	BB	0.031898	BB	-0.633569	10.703690AFFX-2315071	AB	0.000187	AB	-0.119782	9.867624AFFX-2315072	AA	0.063703	AA	0.457675	10.826724AFFX-2315073	AA	0.104675	AA	0.707336	10.555154AFFX-2315074	BB	0.330265	BB	-0.440386	10.172924AFFX-2315075	AA	0.015766	AA	0.726224	11.851231AFFX-2315076	AB	0.153488	AB	0.170568	10.842377!sample_table_end
