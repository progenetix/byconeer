The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672448/suppl/GSM672448_9313_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672448/suppl/GSM672448_9313_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.019431	AA	0.559914	11.643092AFFX-2315061	AB	0.000412	AB	0.118187	10.959773AFFX-2315062	AB	0.023718	AB	-0.004403	10.625828AFFX-2315057	AB	0.025737	AB	-0.030664	10.793411AFFX-2315058	AB	0.002874	AB	0.163380	10.966240AFFX-2315059	AB	0.001014	AB	0.216368	10.345903AFFX-2315063	AB	0.002444	AB	-0.031525	10.794450AFFX-2315064	AB	0.008224	AB	0.286311	10.823211AFFX-2315065	BB	0.086377	BB	-0.395104	10.179009AFFX-2315066	BB	0.006722	BB	-0.670640	10.307842AFFX-2315067	BB	0.026383	BB	-0.538179	10.813774AFFX-2315068	BB	0.001961	BB	-0.626516	10.497737AFFX-2315069	BB	0.011395	BB	-0.838713	10.363169AFFX-2315070	BB	0.043636	BB	-0.701475	10.438873AFFX-2315071	AB	0.011375	AB	-0.217032	9.852345AFFX-2315072	AA	0.019417	AA	0.536535	10.589286AFFX-2315073	AB	0.001703	AB	0.189479	10.601310AFFX-2315074	BB	0.003799	BB	-0.563313	10.296511AFFX-2315075	AA	0.021525	AA	0.656929	11.644427AFFX-2315076	AB	0.011114	AB	0.002160	10.612814!sample_table_end
