The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672856/suppl/GSM672856_3921_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672856/suppl/GSM672856_3921_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.023663	AA	0.594960	11.876040AFFX-2315061	AB	0.005025	AB	0.078359	11.089172AFFX-2315062	AA	0.000731	AA	0.529050	10.377153AFFX-2315057	AB	0.015013	AB	-0.181544	10.760803AFFX-2315058	AA	0.077282	AA	0.676547	11.532220AFFX-2315059	AA	0.030561	AA	0.782522	10.374576AFFX-2315063	AB	0.018539	AB	0.024336	11.000971AFFX-2315064	AB	0.009505	AB	0.152354	10.821961AFFX-2315065	AA	0.045397	AA	0.527594	10.401036AFFX-2315066	BB	0.016455	BB	-0.658096	10.546266AFFX-2315067	AB	0.064758	AB	-0.083616	11.112152AFFX-2315068	AA	0.030285	AA	0.768602	10.790656AFFX-2315069	AB	0.000216	AB	-0.130465	10.601572AFFX-2315070	AB	0.066970	AB	-0.199237	10.753497AFFX-2315071	AB	0.029315	AB	-0.222162	9.614785AFFX-2315072	AA	0.005906	AA	0.523391	10.807337AFFX-2315073	BB	0.012754	BB	-0.656666	10.613015AFFX-2315074	AA	0.049103	AA	0.673014	10.351933AFFX-2315075	AB	0.014680	AB	0.145489	11.595230AFFX-2315076	AB	0.059687	AB	-0.051927	10.865391!sample_table_end
