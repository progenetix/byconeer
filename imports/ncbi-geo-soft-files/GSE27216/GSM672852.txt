The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672852/suppl/GSM672852_3519_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672852/suppl/GSM672852_3519_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.007984	AB	-0.129889	11.917088AFFX-2315061	AB	0.009694	AB	0.196059	10.854461AFFX-2315062	BB	0.046590	BB	-0.571803	10.593387AFFX-2315057	AB	0.000841	AB	-0.116580	10.733267AFFX-2315058	AA	0.021323	AA	0.746414	11.118328AFFX-2315059	BB	0.065677	BB	-0.497479	10.013055AFFX-2315063	AB	0.014525	AB	-0.107062	10.497899AFFX-2315064	AB	0.005414	AB	0.271455	10.620030AFFX-2315065	AB	0.029454	AB	0.008159	10.204409AFFX-2315066	BB	0.027140	BB	-0.589337	10.208532AFFX-2315067	AB	0.027092	AB	0.032169	10.829628AFFX-2315068	AA	0.028828	AA	0.733184	10.422379AFFX-2315069	BB	0.006853	BB	-0.806373	10.358997AFFX-2315070	AB	0.010139	AB	-0.128589	10.497861AFFX-2315071	AB	0.034438	AB	-0.113036	9.459053AFFX-2315072	AA	0.084141	AA	0.435095	10.602283AFFX-2315073	AB	0.022105	AB	0.115941	10.299433AFFX-2315074	AB	0.051283	AB	0.203987	10.225093AFFX-2315075	AB	0.004194	AB	0.017201	11.425875AFFX-2315076	AA	0.046965	AA	0.501930	10.864935!sample_table_end
