The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672906/suppl/GSM672906_6428_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672906/suppl/GSM672906_6428_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.001485	AB	-0.141971	12.305209AFFX-2315061	AB	0.006424	AB	0.181259	11.610263AFFX-2315062	AA	0.015351	AA	0.616773	10.296494AFFX-2315057	AB	0.075796	AB	-0.155277	10.509167AFFX-2315058	AA	0.010175	AA	0.705664	12.139937AFFX-2315059	AB	0.001560	AB	0.263110	10.878145AFFX-2315063	AA	0.003651	AA	0.773111	10.765978AFFX-2315064	AB	0.106776	AB	0.315735	10.129375AFFX-2315065	AA	0.011276	AA	0.499568	10.552240AFFX-2315066	AB	0.005948	AB	-0.050706	10.548780AFFX-2315067	BB	0.027681	BB	-0.635587	11.328809AFFX-2315068	BB	0.001188	BB	-0.710958	10.652384AFFX-2315069	BB	0.045571	BB	-0.710899	10.117355AFFX-2315070	AB	0.006537	AB	-0.047231	10.447109AFFX-2315071	AB	0.004062	AB	-0.236724	10.344882AFFX-2315072	AA	0.044118	AA	0.702843	11.120492AFFX-2315073	AA	0.014828	AA	0.689116	10.658040AFFX-2315074	AB	0.085670	AB	0.220011	9.925577AFFX-2315075	AA	0.020719	AA	0.703242	11.749729AFFX-2315076	AB	0.001913	AB	-0.020087	11.187387!sample_table_end
