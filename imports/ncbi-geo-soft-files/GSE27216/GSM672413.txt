The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672413/suppl/GSM672413_2569_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672413/suppl/GSM672413_2569_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.033934	AB	-0.193638	12.132171AFFX-2315061	BB	0.000895	BB	-0.792970	11.175442AFFX-2315062	BB	0.006851	BB	-0.591775	10.800667AFFX-2315057	BB	0.012551	BB	-0.664420	11.104782AFFX-2315058	AA	0.023118	AA	0.662907	11.437291AFFX-2315059	AB	0.010865	AB	0.319833	10.549387AFFX-2315063	AA	0.012674	AA	0.755263	10.896491AFFX-2315064	AB	0.149840	AB	0.424112	11.007740AFFX-2315065	AB	0.033421	AB	0.026108	10.648646AFFX-2315066	AB	0.029424	AB	0.104520	10.563755AFFX-2315067	AB	0.010149	AB	0.091459	11.265200AFFX-2315068	AB	0.006738	AB	0.214592	10.766688AFFX-2315069	AB	0.007661	AB	-0.078546	10.598713AFFX-2315070	BB	0.018610	BB	-0.621139	10.838738AFFX-2315071	AB	0.003641	AB	-0.158168	9.985415AFFX-2315072	AB	0.026658	AB	-0.123795	11.092498AFFX-2315073	AA	0.035237	AA	0.730761	10.696398AFFX-2315074	BB	0.023253	BB	-0.554162	10.582220AFFX-2315075	AA	0.152712	AA	0.628353	12.047109AFFX-2315076	AB	0.054510	AB	0.133880	10.954694!sample_table_end
