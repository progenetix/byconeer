The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672914/suppl/GSM672914_7531_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672914/suppl/GSM672914_7531_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.011982	AA	0.641936	11.998245AFFX-2315061	BB	0.001433	BB	-0.803463	10.761781AFFX-2315062	AB	0.076245	AB	0.074430	10.082301AFFX-2315057	AB	0.036580	AB	-0.158602	10.446401AFFX-2315058	AA	0.014886	AA	0.776903	11.830263AFFX-2315059	AB	0.034986	AB	0.337954	10.589957AFFX-2315063	AB	0.000576	AB	-0.152384	10.810512AFFX-2315064	AB	0.014661	AB	0.269544	10.180471AFFX-2315065	AA	0.024338	AA	0.427677	10.397602AFFX-2315066	BB	0.005119	BB	-0.680601	10.419587AFFX-2315067	BB	0.035154	BB	-0.536078	10.825654AFFX-2315068	BB	0.009781	BB	-0.785589	10.323019AFFX-2315069	AB	0.011571	AB	-0.093322	9.622351AFFX-2315070	BB	0.028694	BB	-0.544858	10.427638AFFX-2315071	AB	0.010497	AB	-0.212471	10.088484AFFX-2315072	AA	0.001321	AA	0.747325	11.108606AFFX-2315073	AB	0.016832	AB	0.202042	10.439007AFFX-2315074	BB	0.071216	BB	-0.406646	9.628338AFFX-2315075	AA	0.003137	AA	0.748392	11.576876AFFX-2315076	AB	0.009551	AB	0.073807	11.202106!sample_table_end
