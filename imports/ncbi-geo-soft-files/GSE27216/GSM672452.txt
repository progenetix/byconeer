The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672452/suppl/GSM672452_2332_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672452/suppl/GSM672452_2332_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.005679	BB	-0.737552	11.976065AFFX-2315061	BB	0.001906	BB	-0.794177	10.751118AFFX-2315062	AB	0.003784	AB	-0.087381	10.251325AFFX-2315057	AB	0.045459	AB	-0.103243	10.270410AFFX-2315058	AA	0.003089	AA	0.755612	12.001986AFFX-2315059	AB	0.003213	AB	0.269696	10.709430AFFX-2315063	AA	0.000847	AA	0.821850	10.549726AFFX-2315064	AB	0.022683	AB	0.312403	9.991517AFFX-2315065	AB	0.039455	AB	-0.018004	10.182439AFFX-2315066	BB	0.006387	BB	-0.680932	10.436907AFFX-2315067	AB	0.000349	AB	0.038500	11.195752AFFX-2315068	BB	0.004387	BB	-0.788719	10.405214AFFX-2315069	AA	0.028431	AA	0.655352	9.494538AFFX-2315070	BB	0.044929	BB	-0.578511	10.193312AFFX-2315071	AB	0.000213	AB	-0.160526	10.348624AFFX-2315072	AB	0.001048	AB	0.055581	11.096109AFFX-2315073	AA	0.000914	AA	0.795903	10.596805AFFX-2315074	AB	0.027308	AB	0.032492	9.643460AFFX-2315075	AA	0.000495	AA	0.731929	11.470897AFFX-2315076	AB	0.020798	AB	-0.106940	10.996662!sample_table_end
