The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672461/suppl/GSM672461_2894_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672461/suppl/GSM672461_2894_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.027003	AA	0.796616	11.745299AFFX-2315061	AB	0.034859	AB	0.277008	10.848024AFFX-2315062	BB	0.004035	BB	-0.661389	10.204735AFFX-2315057	AB	0.010975	AB	-0.119981	10.582937AFFX-2315058	AA	0.034983	AA	0.826261	11.827687AFFX-2315059	AB	0.016132	AB	0.308054	10.634907AFFX-2315063	AB	0.003893	AB	-0.115503	10.762133AFFX-2315064	AB	0.076003	AB	0.196052	9.886982AFFX-2315065	AB	0.021437	AB	-0.020224	10.243477AFFX-2315066	BB	0.006083	BB	-0.687989	10.325458AFFX-2315067	BB	0.015219	BB	-0.669761	10.941566AFFX-2315068	AA	0.000950	AA	0.854073	10.673392AFFX-2315069	BB	0.046666	BB	-0.687539	9.597193AFFX-2315070	BB	0.099444	BB	-0.511933	10.526443AFFX-2315071	AB	0.007095	AB	-0.165400	10.083581AFFX-2315072	AA	0.012660	AA	0.786019	11.090400AFFX-2315073	AB	0.009104	AB	0.106385	10.426468AFFX-2315074	BB	0.005188	BB	-0.468193	9.793442AFFX-2315075	AB	0.001044	AB	0.098416	11.611241AFFX-2315076	BB	0.000916	BB	-0.692608	11.042253!sample_table_end
