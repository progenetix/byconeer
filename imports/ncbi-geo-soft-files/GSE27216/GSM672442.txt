The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672442/suppl/GSM672442_8960_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672442/suppl/GSM672442_8960_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.000455	BB	-0.667965	12.162880AFFX-2315061	AB	0.004563	AB	0.117940	11.145344AFFX-2315062	AB	0.042017	AB	0.007758	10.641851AFFX-2315057	BB	0.000793	BB	-0.623396	11.001877AFFX-2315058	AA	0.053676	AA	0.655273	11.733934AFFX-2315059	AB	0.002442	AB	0.270340	10.615276AFFX-2315063	AB	0.000398	AB	-0.046148	11.054861AFFX-2315064	AA	0.006710	AA	0.837897	11.034384AFFX-2315065	AB	0.004821	AB	-0.028807	10.533024AFFX-2315066	BB	0.000167	BB	-0.654411	10.674478AFFX-2315067	BB	0.020464	BB	-0.576074	11.132944AFFX-2315068	AB	0.002997	AB	0.209022	10.926298AFFX-2315069	AB	0.001728	AB	-0.180105	10.708785AFFX-2315070	AB	0.001345	AB	-0.131878	10.930900AFFX-2315071	AA	0.017856	AA	0.722184	9.735513AFFX-2315072	AA	0.032366	AA	0.480573	11.045352AFFX-2315073	AA	0.006652	AA	0.772230	10.889959AFFX-2315074	AB	0.035077	AB	-0.125499	10.550789AFFX-2315075	AA	0.011343	AA	0.666448	11.724200AFFX-2315076	AB	0.187916	AB	0.180622	10.837963!sample_table_end
