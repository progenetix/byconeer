The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672887/suppl/GSM672887_1815_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672887/suppl/GSM672887_1815_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.007112	AB	-0.183378	12.335095AFFX-2315061	AA	0.004671	AA	0.901149	11.651493AFFX-2315062	AB	0.092924	AB	-0.184728	10.268375AFFX-2315057	AA	0.121608	AA	0.532465	10.454117AFFX-2315058	AA	0.029518	AA	0.757706	12.236663AFFX-2315059	AB	0.055908	AB	0.363348	11.012403AFFX-2315063	AB	0.006670	AB	-0.180529	10.886457AFFX-2315064	AB	0.453186	AB	0.395092	10.305253AFFX-2315065	AA	0.014757	AA	0.480579	10.321561AFFX-2315066	BB	0.001149	BB	-0.634534	10.533377AFFX-2315067	AB	0.036200	AB	0.111862	11.491263AFFX-2315068	AB	0.005629	AB	0.152778	10.656448AFFX-2315069	AA	0.046837	AA	0.551633	10.002727AFFX-2315070	AA	0.068297	AA	0.353627	10.366801AFFX-2315071	AB	0.004496	AB	-0.097166	10.261648AFFX-2315072	AA	0.128640	AA	0.778887	11.244358AFFX-2315073	BB	0.012804	BB	-0.684447	10.555570AFFX-2315074	AA	0.058176	AA	0.469341	10.001378AFFX-2315075	AB	0.186956	AB	0.261524	11.885645AFFX-2315076	AB	0.026930	AB	0.015745	11.363757!sample_table_end
