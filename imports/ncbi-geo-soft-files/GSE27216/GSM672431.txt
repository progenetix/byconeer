The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672431/suppl/GSM672431_8160_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672431/suppl/GSM672431_8160_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.034032	AA	0.542388	11.704133AFFX-2315061	AA	0.001287	AA	0.827242	10.893453AFFX-2315062	AA	0.015837	AA	0.595814	10.414833AFFX-2315057	AB	0.000145	AB	-0.127381	10.726224AFFX-2315058	AA	0.000008	AA	0.700321	11.205938AFFX-2315059	AB	0.000681	AB	0.250700	10.381820AFFX-2315063	AB	0.002343	AB	-0.090476	10.844778AFFX-2315064	AA	0.014770	AA	0.837129	10.860817AFFX-2315065	AB	0.040926	AB	-0.070173	10.483771AFFX-2315066	BB	0.023207	BB	-0.589129	10.470820AFFX-2315067	BB	0.000283	BB	-0.507237	10.948454AFFX-2315068	AB	0.000683	AB	0.167599	10.582673AFFX-2315069	AA	0.000248	AA	0.755631	10.442942AFFX-2315070	BB	0.033442	BB	-0.622409	10.772802AFFX-2315071	AB	0.011113	AB	-0.212935	9.724941AFFX-2315072	AA	0.004619	AA	0.504485	10.772107AFFX-2315073	AA	0.001483	AA	0.727018	10.599235AFFX-2315074	AB	0.003625	AB	0.010709	10.364567AFFX-2315075	AB	0.009531	AB	0.116392	11.596218AFFX-2315076	AB	0.023213	AB	0.052864	10.819545!sample_table_end
