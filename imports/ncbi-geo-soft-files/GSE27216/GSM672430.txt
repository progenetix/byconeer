The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672430/suppl/GSM672430_8135_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672430/suppl/GSM672430_8135_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.000553	BB	-0.674693	11.904006AFFX-2315061	AB	0.012140	AB	-0.023381	10.895066AFFX-2315062	AB	0.013382	AB	-0.092994	10.401096AFFX-2315057	BB	0.004324	BB	-0.585066	10.811555AFFX-2315058	AA	0.010134	AA	0.689961	11.317194AFFX-2315059	AB	0.000609	AB	0.225364	10.354575AFFX-2315063	AB	0.010532	AB	-0.118828	10.565230AFFX-2315064	AB	0.011712	AB	0.276499	10.560814AFFX-2315065	AA	0.010325	AA	0.457489	10.273063AFFX-2315066	BB	0.021296	BB	-0.620697	10.191380AFFX-2315067	AB	0.001851	AB	0.036682	10.969069AFFX-2315068	AA	0.005044	AA	0.796600	10.615462AFFX-2315069	AA	0.000954	AA	0.774869	10.392236AFFX-2315070	AA	0.058174	AA	0.484838	10.423624AFFX-2315071	AB	0.017065	AB	-0.099276	9.559229AFFX-2315072	AA	0.026160	AA	0.474639	10.810862AFFX-2315073	AA	0.004249	AA	0.746183	10.601181AFFX-2315074	BB	0.128834	BB	-0.480048	10.398123AFFX-2315075	AB	0.008857	AB	0.006339	11.557800AFFX-2315076	BB	0.064976	BB	-0.409160	10.664696!sample_table_end
