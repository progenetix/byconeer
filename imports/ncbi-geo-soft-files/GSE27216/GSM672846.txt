The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672846/suppl/GSM672846_2714_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672846/suppl/GSM672846_2714_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	BB	0.004595	BB	-0.632301	12.163367AFFX-2315061	AB	0.004497	AB	0.171852	11.258940AFFX-2315062	AA	0.003013	AA	0.602427	10.664974AFFX-2315057	BB	0.025017	BB	-0.562840	11.009522AFFX-2315058	AA	0.008822	AA	0.666450	11.502059AFFX-2315059	AB	0.000166	AB	0.232830	10.592957AFFX-2315063	AB	0.006281	AB	-0.030629	10.897991AFFX-2315064	BB	0.000524	BB	-0.699674	10.754591AFFX-2315065	BB	0.132742	BB	-0.381400	10.622840AFFX-2315066	AB	0.001318	AB	0.048913	10.741978AFFX-2315067	BB	0.009090	BB	-0.516021	11.107477AFFX-2315068	BB	0.001659	BB	-0.664489	10.870021AFFX-2315069	AB	0.002504	AB	-0.162729	10.825516AFFX-2315070	BB	0.055253	BB	-0.595514	10.978793AFFX-2315071	BB	0.005724	BB	-0.695101	9.890105AFFX-2315072	AA	0.005275	AA	0.550178	10.923612AFFX-2315073	AB	0.010058	AB	0.236474	10.834570AFFX-2315074	BB	0.035344	BB	-0.532836	10.504579AFFX-2315075	AA	0.009046	AA	0.662475	11.746643AFFX-2315076	BB	0.010149	BB	-0.509094	11.007309!sample_table_end
