The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672444/suppl/GSM672444_8994_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672444/suppl/GSM672444_8994_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.007150	AA	0.664091	11.998314AFFX-2315061	BB	0.002957	BB	-0.781251	11.030128AFFX-2315062	AB	0.020024	AB	-0.111930	10.700881AFFX-2315057	BB	0.018468	BB	-0.636563	11.151166AFFX-2315058	AA	0.027887	AA	0.685572	11.407496AFFX-2315059	AA	0.027110	AA	0.785068	10.573581AFFX-2315063	AA	0.000328	AA	0.799341	10.798439AFFX-2315064	AA	0.004284	AA	0.834638	11.078991AFFX-2315065	BB	0.040476	BB	-0.504056	10.823784AFFX-2315066	BB	0.008658	BB	-0.653682	10.564496AFFX-2315067	BB	0.230282	BB	-0.386354	11.142592AFFX-2315068	AA	0.035148	AA	0.752948	10.594776AFFX-2315069	AA	0.010381	AA	0.752581	10.453453AFFX-2315070	AB	0.059073	AB	-0.171127	10.655326AFFX-2315071	AA	0.002478	AA	0.668971	9.775303AFFX-2315072	AA	0.011855	AA	0.489496	10.911890AFFX-2315073	AB	0.039982	AB	0.209541	10.562104AFFX-2315074	BB	0.025982	BB	-0.543425	10.535545AFFX-2315075	AA	0.059023	AA	0.651501	11.956702AFFX-2315076	BB	0.001507	BB	-0.463556	10.887059!sample_table_end
