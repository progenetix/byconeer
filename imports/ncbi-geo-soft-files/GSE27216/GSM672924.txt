The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672924/suppl/GSM672924_9609_Father_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672924/suppl/GSM672924_9609_Father_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.002180	AB	-0.107622	12.433184AFFX-2315061	BB	0.002970	BB	-0.785332	11.370701AFFX-2315062	AA	0.105187	AA	0.727390	10.841491AFFX-2315057	BB	0.114923	BB	-0.597548	10.874837AFFX-2315058	AA	0.013816	AA	0.719393	12.366780AFFX-2315059	AB	0.023631	AB	0.252541	11.199161AFFX-2315063	AA	0.015259	AA	0.801751	10.856700AFFX-2315064	AB	0.280451	AB	0.373221	10.574012AFFX-2315065	BB	0.014364	BB	-0.483660	10.737854AFFX-2315066	BB	0.059285	BB	-0.671043	10.807833AFFX-2315067	AB	0.012133	AB	0.049878	11.508971AFFX-2315068	AA	0.014802	AA	0.811863	11.075877AFFX-2315069	BB	0.030895	BB	-0.722921	10.165684AFFX-2315070	AA	0.037687	AA	0.589622	10.678398AFFX-2315071	AA	0.050588	AA	0.810083	10.647403AFFX-2315072	AB	0.046824	AB	0.006235	11.626238AFFX-2315073	AB	0.042658	AB	0.065760	11.179853AFFX-2315074	AB	0.230950	AB	-0.078695	10.072590AFFX-2315075	AA	0.058196	AA	0.720134	11.996092AFFX-2315076	AB	0.104477	AB	0.042188	11.622279!sample_table_end
