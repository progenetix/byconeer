The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672422/suppl/GSM672422_6932_Child_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672422/suppl/GSM672422_6932_Child_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.007530	AB	-0.013896	11.925167AFFX-2315061	BB	0.003019	BB	-0.773084	10.854485AFFX-2315062	AA	0.032670	AA	0.566542	10.233638AFFX-2315057	AB	0.101781	AB	-0.210743	10.495767AFFX-2315058	AA	0.030818	AA	0.658409	11.322168AFFX-2315059	AB	0.003799	AB	0.236149	10.485800AFFX-2315063	AB	0.018126	AB	-0.171959	10.741121AFFX-2315064	AB	0.004492	AB	0.179303	10.759467AFFX-2315065	AB	0.000288	AB	-0.045999	10.284504AFFX-2315066	BB	0.011092	BB	-0.594912	10.391068AFFX-2315067	AB	0.010177	AB	0.056599	10.891028AFFX-2315068	AA	0.018621	AA	0.820971	10.572192AFFX-2315069	AA	0.001655	AA	0.771201	10.507833AFFX-2315070	BB	0.055257	BB	-0.695571	10.404746AFFX-2315071	AA	0.005237	AA	0.633169	9.733302AFFX-2315072	AA	0.026029	AA	0.510382	10.571987AFFX-2315073	AB	0.001595	AB	0.138100	10.506410AFFX-2315074	AB	0.030574	AB	0.164065	10.184103AFFX-2315075	AB	0.000203	AB	0.058744	11.464288AFFX-2315076	AA	0.145374	AA	0.394370	10.594954!sample_table_end
