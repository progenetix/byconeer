The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672415/suppl/GSM672415_2569_Mother_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672415/suppl/GSM672415_2569_Mother_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.076804	AB	-0.231310	12.091523AFFX-2315061	BB	0.010155	BB	-0.811629	10.965757AFFX-2315062	BB	0.008019	BB	-0.652845	10.719016AFFX-2315057	AB	0.106228	AB	-0.167649	10.641378AFFX-2315058	AA	0.023729	AA	0.743286	11.637199AFFX-2315059	AA	0.192123	AA	0.709246	10.357358AFFX-2315063	AA	0.002609	AA	0.779916	10.723830AFFX-2315064	BB	0.007263	BB	-0.771522	10.768332AFFX-2315065	AA	0.014999	AA	0.470142	10.362200AFFX-2315066	BB	0.011847	BB	-0.711800	10.624008AFFX-2315067	BB	0.094958	BB	-0.570810	10.925897AFFX-2315068	AA	0.017832	AA	0.789437	10.666024AFFX-2315069	AB	0.069578	AB	-0.311614	10.550471AFFX-2315070	AB	0.102453	AB	-0.164596	10.558000AFFX-2315071	AA	0.130063	AA	0.508587	9.755391AFFX-2315072	BB	0.173921	BB	-0.475245	10.549482AFFX-2315073	AB	0.015947	AB	0.144820	10.649021AFFX-2315074	BB	0.118042	BB	-0.513087	10.276827AFFX-2315075	AA	0.038955	AA	0.758956	11.792736AFFX-2315076	AB	0.023722	AB	0.048137	10.809709!sample_table_end
