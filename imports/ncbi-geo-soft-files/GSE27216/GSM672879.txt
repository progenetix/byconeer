The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672879/suppl/GSM672879_9609_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672879/suppl/GSM672879_9609_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.005547	AB	-0.080755	12.075611AFFX-2315061	BB	0.009029	BB	-0.817833	10.985931AFFX-2315062	AA	0.008582	AA	0.638300	10.698595AFFX-2315057	BB	0.014426	BB	-0.673461	11.053251AFFX-2315058	AA	0.046493	AA	0.754491	11.491158AFFX-2315059	AB	0.006399	AB	0.293009	10.636979AFFX-2315063	AA	0.001673	AA	0.805737	10.855023AFFX-2315064	AB	0.033587	AB	0.337964	10.970137AFFX-2315065	BB	0.011614	BB	-0.461090	10.551059AFFX-2315066	BB	0.038229	BB	-0.701466	10.452276AFFX-2315067	AB	0.019850	AB	0.113260	11.223401AFFX-2315068	AA	0.016920	AA	0.785025	10.667965AFFX-2315069	BB	0.000297	BB	-0.843659	10.752790AFFX-2315070	AA	0.009196	AA	0.680425	10.664401AFFX-2315071	AA	0.006927	AA	0.693946	9.747060AFFX-2315072	AB	0.005007	AB	-0.049817	11.041609AFFX-2315073	AB	0.009739	AB	0.119155	10.714074AFFX-2315074	AB	0.017598	AB	0.127024	10.432115AFFX-2315075	AA	0.022802	AA	0.733382	11.741035AFFX-2315076	AB	0.073499	AB	-0.028703	10.739969!sample_table_end
