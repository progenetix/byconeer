The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672441/suppl/GSM672441_8960_Father_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672441/suppl/GSM672441_8960_Father_Nsp.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 262314#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AA	0.010061	AA	0.604641	12.158290AFFX-2315061	AB	0.008423	AB	0.145716	11.124718AFFX-2315062	BB	0.036699	BB	-0.657498	10.573141AFFX-2315057	AB	0.004876	AB	-0.124284	10.872044AFFX-2315058	AA	0.016193	AA	0.666793	11.648440AFFX-2315059	AA	0.248554	AA	0.665812	10.744957AFFX-2315063	AB	0.010218	AB	-0.084580	10.911441AFFX-2315064	AB	0.015640	AB	0.229411	10.871173AFFX-2315065	AA	0.008942	AA	0.483944	10.564338AFFX-2315066	BB	0.033563	BB	-0.648597	10.449323AFFX-2315067	BB	0.023774	BB	-0.542415	11.062528AFFX-2315068	AA	0.003225	AA	0.763373	10.816833AFFX-2315069	AB	0.003023	AB	-0.196887	10.737150AFFX-2315070	AB	0.033353	AB	-0.016977	10.754606AFFX-2315071	AB	0.017137	AB	0.014567	9.804067AFFX-2315072	AA	0.013477	AA	0.496452	11.016224AFFX-2315073	AA	0.012356	AA	0.710723	10.818043AFFX-2315074	AB	0.002297	AB	0.066256	10.490952AFFX-2315075	BB	0.023898	BB	-0.552873	11.665644AFFX-2315076	BB	0.028995	BB	-0.444817	10.743892!sample_table_end
