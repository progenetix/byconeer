The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672905/suppl/GSM672905_6428_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672905/suppl/GSM672905_6428_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.000832	AB	-0.143700	12.337553AFFX-2315061	AA	0.002203	AA	0.888134	11.662837AFFX-2315062	AB	0.001335	AB	-0.058954	10.549018AFFX-2315057	AB	0.043755	AB	-0.138158	10.549921AFFX-2315058	AB	0.001402	AB	0.136204	12.215771AFFX-2315059	BB	0.002084	BB	-0.675331	10.701537AFFX-2315063	AB	0.007043	AB	-0.171248	10.992560AFFX-2315064	NC	0.501804	AB	0.396947	10.286290AFFX-2315065	AA	0.007394	AA	0.492563	10.412958AFFX-2315066	AA	0.013364	AA	0.678374	10.430190AFFX-2315067	AB	0.000266	AB	0.021638	11.398814AFFX-2315068	AB	0.010481	AB	0.020600	10.766629AFFX-2315069	BB	0.050498	BB	-0.680322	10.246439AFFX-2315070	AB	0.044472	AB	-0.169701	10.509585AFFX-2315071	AB	0.000159	AB	-0.164895	10.352555AFFX-2315072	AA	0.052415	AA	0.708900	11.204671AFFX-2315073	AB	0.004518	AB	0.194700	10.631635AFFX-2315074	AB	0.060399	AB	0.206864	10.067472AFFX-2315075	AA	0.032381	AA	0.737674	11.687659AFFX-2315076	AB	0.016144	AB	-0.008043	11.323517!sample_table_end
