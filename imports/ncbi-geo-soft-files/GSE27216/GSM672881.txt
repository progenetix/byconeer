The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672881/suppl/GSM672881_1056_Child_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672881/suppl/GSM672881_1056_Child_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.000758	AB	-0.099245	12.365884AFFX-2315061	AB	0.001304	AB	0.139656	11.655005AFFX-2315062	AA	0.015824	AA	0.603490	10.484171AFFX-2315057	AB	0.033816	AB	-0.058930	10.679126AFFX-2315058	AA	0.043165	AA	0.757491	12.136216AFFX-2315059	AA	0.011640	AA	0.815222	10.892914AFFX-2315063	AA	0.001852	AA	0.737873	10.614352AFFX-2315064	AA	0.057962	AA	0.683983	10.159027AFFX-2315065	AA	0.012256	AA	0.403069	10.454136AFFX-2315066	AB	0.005519	AB	0.029946	10.348814AFFX-2315067	AB	0.074561	AB	0.155157	11.300718AFFX-2315068	AB	0.003156	AB	0.108580	10.681942AFFX-2315069	AA	0.020624	AA	0.593209	10.089785AFFX-2315070	AB	0.048286	AB	-0.131441	10.745177AFFX-2315071	AB	0.065261	AB	-0.360297	10.130376AFFX-2315072	AA	0.072078	AA	0.689092	11.304723AFFX-2315073	AA	0.014750	AA	0.726553	10.389180AFFX-2315074	NC	0.711094	AB	-0.153651	10.004160AFFX-2315075	AA	0.029225	AA	0.661279	11.810080AFFX-2315076	AA	0.013650	AA	0.607833	11.242324!sample_table_end
