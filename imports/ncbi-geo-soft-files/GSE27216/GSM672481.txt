The Gaussian bandwidth was set to 0 Kb and a minimum of 5 probes was required to detect a CNV. The findings were visualized using GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) from Affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Tracy,,Tucker!Sample_contact_email = tbtucker@interchange.ubc.ca!Sample_contact_institute = University of British Columbia!Sample_contact_address = Box 153 4480 Oak Street!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V6H3V4!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672481/suppl/GSM672481_8327_Mother_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM672nnn/GSM672481/suppl/GSM672481_8327_Mother_Sty.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27216!Sample_series_id = GSE27367!Sample_data_row_count = 238354#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #CONTRAST = #STRENGTH = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	CONTRAST	STRENGTHAFFX-2315060	AB	0.005433	AB	-0.149663	11.903742AFFX-2315061	AA	0.001200	AA	0.876072	10.908189AFFX-2315062	AA	0.001370	AA	0.654842	10.142114AFFX-2315057	AB	0.009577	AB	-0.039309	10.608445AFFX-2315058	AA	0.033762	AA	0.828059	11.838539AFFX-2315059	AB	0.028367	AB	0.337847	10.696158AFFX-2315063	AA	0.006808	AA	0.755526	10.429399AFFX-2315064	AB	0.010426	AB	0.252118	10.008387AFFX-2315065	AA	0.013590	AA	0.420581	10.191322AFFX-2315066	BB	0.000759	BB	-0.696391	10.431100AFFX-2315067	BB	0.028064	BB	-0.633597	10.795573AFFX-2315068	AA	0.003231	AA	0.841063	10.601618AFFX-2315069	BB	0.049397	BB	-0.664624	9.762520AFFX-2315070	BB	0.005799	BB	-0.580082	10.436794AFFX-2315071	AA	0.004528	AA	0.744335	9.981793AFFX-2315072	AA	0.002153	AA	0.741876	11.149813AFFX-2315073	AB	0.010940	AB	0.100510	10.405390AFFX-2315074	AB	0.023485	AB	0.178960	9.814188AFFX-2315075	AA	0.002460	AA	0.749771	11.474097AFFX-2315076	BB	0.005285	BB	-0.735579	11.159715!sample_table_end
