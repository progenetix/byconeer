The data quality was assessed using the QC Report output in F.E. 10.5.  All arrays that passed the experimental Q.C. were then visualized and analyzed using DNA Analytics 4.0.85 and the ADM2 step gram algorithm.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Christian,,Ruiz!Sample_contact_email = christian.ruiz@unibas.ch!Sample_contact_phone = +41 61 265 3152!Sample_contact_fax = +41 61 265 2966!Sample_contact_department = Institute for Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = University Hospital Basel!Sample_contact_address = Schoenbeinstrasse 40!Sample_contact_city = Basel!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4031!Sample_contact_country = Switzerland!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM595nnn/GSM595615/suppl/GSM595615_US45102967_251469329265_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE24216!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = Value calculated by Agilent FE (LogRatio), representing test/reference.!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	2.08E-022	0.00E+003	0.00E+004	-5.11E-025	-2.17E-026	1.36E-017	7.66E-028	1.34E-019	2.23E-0110	-1.27E-0211	1.05E-0112	3.00E-0113	-2.05E-0114	2.60E-0115	3.68E-0216	-1.73E-0217	-1.75E-0118	-9.01E-0219	-4.12E-0220	1.77E-01!sample_table_end
