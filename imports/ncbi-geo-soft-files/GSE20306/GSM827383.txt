The following parameters were used: Background subtraction--Mismatch probe (PM/MM difference); Normalization--Invariant set probe selection method and Running median smoothing method (baseline array NA06990); Raw copy number determination--Signal / (mean signal of normal samples at this SNP) * 2; log2 ratio--log2(Signal / mean signal of normal samples at this SNP); Inferred copy number method-- Median smoothing with window size of 3.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The SNP calls are available in the supplementary .txt file that is linked to this record. The data table containing the Signal values (analgous to the expression value in expression array analysis) for each SNP probe produced by dCHIP is available in the supplementary .txt file that is linked to the Series GSE20306 record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Stephen,Michael,Rothenberg!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Center!Sample_contact_institute = Massachusetts General Hospital!Sample_contact_address = 13th Street, Bldg. 149, 7th Floor!Sample_contact_city = Charlestown!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02129!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM827nnn/GSM827383/suppl/GSM827383.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM827nnn/GSM827383/suppl/GSM827383.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20306!Sample_data_row_count = 0
