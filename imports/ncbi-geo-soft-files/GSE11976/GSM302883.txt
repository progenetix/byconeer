HCC1395BL is a B lymphoblastoid cell line initiated by Epstein-Barr virus transformation of pheripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from the same patient as the breast carcinoma cell line HCC1395. Available from ATCC (www.atcc.org) as CRL-2325D.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Extraction of genomic DNA from fresh frozen tissue was performed using proteinase K and repeated phenol-chloroform extraction.!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Genotyping was performed using Illumina Infinium HumanCNV370 Genotyping BeadChips according to the manufacturerÃs protocol (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, www.illumina.com). 750ng of genomic DNA was whole-genome amplified in an overnight reaction at 37Â¡C using amplification master mix (WG-AMM) and primer/neutralization mix (WG-MP1). After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48Â¡C, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA extracted from lymphoblastoid cell line was genotyped using Infinium HumanCNV370-Duov1 Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 3.1.3 with GT module 3.2.33 (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6986!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE11976!Sample_data_row_count = 370404#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#GC_SCORE = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	GC_SCORE	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratiors10000010-126_B_F_IFB1153208421:0	AB	0.9368909	0.6376036	0.9089395	0.5717795	-0.1783753rs10000023-126_B_F_IFB1153358872:0	AB	0.8234195	0.4956053	2.23839	0.498775	-0.1479402rs10000030-120_B_R_IFB1137703207:0	BB	0.8158658	0.9984611	0.7081491	1	-0.1375899rs1000007-123_T_F_IFB1152225452:0	AB	0.8747823	0.6351913	1.136487	0.4832841	0.1271511rs10000092-123_T_R_IFB1153358875:0	AA	0.9264655	0.008562843	0.9632156	0.001200471	0.3527883rs10000121-126_B_R_IFB1136471760:0	BB	0.891854	0.991277	0.6152869	1	-0.02967967rs1000014-126_B_R_IFB1136184019:0	AB	0.7254323	0.4304388	2.282417	0.4618251	0.09233364rs10000141-126_T_F_IFB1137734411:0	BB	0.8891098	0.9954053	0.908791	1	-0.01931572rs1000016-126_B_R_IFB1156563530:0	AA	0.875866	0.00970814	1.506209	0.008224374	-0.2391678rs10000169-119_T_R_IFB1135612081:0	AA	0.8703538	0.008089419	0.9895188	0.000992557	-0.01802201rs1000022-126_B_F_IFB1135126284:0	AA	0.8797732	0.007234262	1.044719	0	0.3955368rs10000272-126_T_R_IFB1136539894:0	AA	0.8434824	0.004597846	1.985752	0.003177585	0.07204487rs10000282-121_T_R_IFB1136743500:0	BB	0.8183947	0.9965705	1.273965	1	0.09141953rs10000300-126_T_R_IFB1152704058:0	BB	0.8601294	1	0.8525798	1	0.2682853rs1000031-123_B_F_IFB1135583872:0	BB	0.8717313	0.991019	1.743528	1	0.2035538rs1000032-126_B_R_IFB1136145093:0	BB	0.384529	0.9925227	1.170156	1	0.04502852rs10000388-126_B_F_IFB1135932472:0	AA	0.9530174	0.005639025	1.449965	0	0.09569232rs1000040-126_T_F_IFB1152704061:0	AB	0.8484263	0.601849	1.567985	0.4927297	0.6465482rs1000041-126_T_F_IFB1153889147:0	BB	0.8351063	0.9867042	1.420235	1	0.0246116rs10000432-126_T_R_IFB1135756304:0	AB	0.8544981	0.7342706	0.7106868	0.5546562	-0.009547683!sample_table_end
