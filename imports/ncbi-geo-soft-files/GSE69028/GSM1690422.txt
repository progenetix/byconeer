CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690422/suppl/GSM1690422_20111212_MART_MM_SNP162_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690422/suppl/GSM1690422_20111212_MART_MM_SNP162_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.009728	BB	557.260681	3223.701660SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.002068	BB	291.837280	856.808472SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.005712	BB	960.238464	4217.630371SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.001559	BB	484.201996	1676.273804SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.000974	AA	1285.710205	330.889221SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.001077	AA	2202.577148	344.505432SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.006804	AB	728.029846	615.221375SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.004143	AA	1619.182495	447.075073SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.001862	AA	1630.124268	451.923584SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.003823	AB	1648.125488	1381.034668SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.000720	AB	1460.950073	1801.045898SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.008520	BB	785.060608	3113.377197SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.004018	AA	1664.342651	320.149292SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.005755	AA	1242.492310	451.923584SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.001186	AB	723.518250	636.615906SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.002348	AA	2645.960449	1068.841919SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.001136	AA	3551.846436	866.520203SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.004909	AA	1617.781494	349.965820SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.001955	AA	3743.769531	951.750854SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.001358	AB	1049.668579	880.965637!sample_table_end
