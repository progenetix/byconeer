CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689840/suppl/GSM1689840_20090728_MART_MM_SNP20bis__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689840/suppl/GSM1689840_20090728_MART_MM_SNP20bis__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.005235	BB	762.678894	2470.483643SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.003347	BB	329.515594	708.200012SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004252	BB	1129.619995	3613.489258SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.003773	BB	544.354431	1845.870605SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.004728	AA	1117.166260	288.539337SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.001146	AA	2074.809082	349.402313SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.002329	AB	961.041199	853.757812SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.000938	AA	1474.509888	496.721344SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.007024	AB	1126.620361	1217.620483SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.015537	AB	964.860413	797.311523SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.005937	AB	1205.172607	1793.824219SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.007424	BB	684.125488	3675.709961SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.003817	AA	1069.177002	246.612076SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.002842	AB	1241.058838	1424.167969SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.009267	AA	1104.211426	231.884949SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.012741	AA	3280.352539	1101.320923SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.003893	AA	2916.164062	830.163269SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.001442	AA	1535.259766	300.314209SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.001337	AA	3495.810303	970.380920SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.002905	AA	2215.812256	418.443970!sample_table_end
