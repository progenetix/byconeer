CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690426/suppl/GSM1690426_20111212_MART_MM_SNP160_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690426/suppl/GSM1690426_20111212_MART_MM_SNP160_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.002055	BB	512.832825	2499.520508SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.004268	AB	599.189697	561.871460SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.014765	BB	1258.812378	5501.824219SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.007289	AB	1800.696899	1222.018555SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.004083	AA	1052.534546	326.666260SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.003032	AA	2519.353516	368.165161SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.004865	BB	341.856659	1465.092407SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.001231	AA	1525.696167	471.358093SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.004695	AA	1750.304688	404.679321SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.006630	AB	1351.854126	1483.440308SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.007391	AB	1875.940430	1833.872925SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.001867	BB	548.718140	2625.959229SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.003132	AA	1450.335571	249.331299SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.002379	AB	1020.105591	1476.988403SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.013123	AA	730.181580	322.640106SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.004771	AA	2424.845459	840.730042SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.004563	AA	3814.939209	800.723328SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.021045	AA	2057.173828	299.129059SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.004982	AA	3992.143555	895.987244SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.001384	AA	1745.844238	369.288544!sample_table_end
