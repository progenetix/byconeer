CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689869/suppl/GSM1689869_20110905_MART_MM_SNP111__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689869/suppl/GSM1689869_20110905_MART_MM_SNP111__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.004338	BB	394.836823	2261.541016SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.003719	BB	231.207840	692.141724SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001105	BB	1325.051880	4368.619141SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.004101	BB	441.565704	1268.517700SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.007438	AA	1048.832642	266.599915SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.001220	AA	2170.895264	340.595123SNP_A-1980898	AA	0.003258	AA	1475.997559	258.973663SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.005362	AA	1585.531738	424.624939SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.008713	AA	2022.809082	439.477173SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.007840	BB	758.357788	2036.230225SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.005037	BB	483.180389	2033.501099SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.010399	BB	565.719421	1951.114136SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.013465	AA	1062.609375	344.917969SNP_A-1997896	BB	0.004958	BB	682.896667	2294.897949SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.006888	AA	662.341309	224.274582SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.003268	AA	2126.251221	858.380554SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.005786	AA	3834.633301	756.990356SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.000336	AA	1408.117798	303.446777SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.005113	AA	2973.563232	741.963501SNP_A-4268173	BB	0.001665	BB	394.271790	1857.980103!sample_table_end
