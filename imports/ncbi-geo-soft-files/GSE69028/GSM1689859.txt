CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689859/suppl/GSM1689859_20110404_MART_MM_SNP84__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689859/suppl/GSM1689859_20110404_MART_MM_SNP84__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.011143	BB	711.478943	3403.705566SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.014655	BB	357.927185	1143.170166SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.005819	BB	1183.216309	3521.054443SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.024420	BB	682.839478	2381.828125SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.005377	AA	1266.380127	429.896576SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.004071	AA	2496.801025	434.548828SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.009385	BB	311.129333	1558.497681SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.026590	AA	2887.052979	820.264465SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.055746	AA	3056.039062	529.764954SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.008230	BB	721.745483	2647.452393SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.018480	BB	480.076019	3201.796875SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.017947	BB	894.172546	3523.020752SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.005315	AA	1541.807129	241.377197SNP_A-1997896	BB	0.006447	BB	615.882874	3038.855957SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.001295	AA	952.847351	299.854950SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.025876	AA	3800.057129	1400.468872SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.007323	BB	1338.822144	4020.552246SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.002526	AA	1412.301758	337.083405SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.006598	AA	4122.711914	1062.496948SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.007484	AA	2419.748779	351.415466!sample_table_end
