CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690427/suppl/GSM1690427_20111212_MART_MM_SNP163_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690427/suppl/GSM1690427_20111212_MART_MM_SNP163_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.010812	AB	1993.831543	1826.611572SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.003499	BB	235.311310	728.649780SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.015306	BB	746.147766	4184.958496SNP_A-4263484	AA	0.002641	AA	2323.541016	449.290375SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.002324	AA	1486.246582	376.444336SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.004221	AA	2527.232910	344.967438SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.005220	AB	731.741028	695.694641SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.025062	AA	1891.063477	386.581268SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.014458	AB	1284.122925	1373.709961SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.004042	AB	1620.575439	1246.064575SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.000862	AB	1539.035767	1744.715576SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.002008	BB	562.252136	2845.923584SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.000492	AA	1354.046509	271.929474SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.006702	AA	1564.354980	653.869873SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.002641	AB	621.413147	556.708862SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.009163	AA	3136.129883	1405.282837SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.004181	AA	3872.059082	1108.640991SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.009914	AA	1680.720459	384.353119SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.011167	AA	3907.967041	722.019043SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.002104	AA	1875.558105	231.355179!sample_table_end
