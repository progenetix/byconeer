CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690414/suppl/GSM1690414_20111212_MART_MM_SNP166_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690414/suppl/GSM1690414_20111212_MART_MM_SNP166_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.009270	BB	395.554138	2805.311279SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.000633	BB	301.998749	752.565735SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004188	BB	1014.064209	3701.327148SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.007521	AB	1807.214233	1220.328369SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.009130	AA	1472.428223	464.297607SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.001865	AA	2242.878662	404.600647SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.002351	AB	835.783691	686.346558SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.002013	AA	1349.638062	471.398590SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.005149	AB	1297.792847	1152.745850SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.003741	BB	474.734619	1826.791992SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.001783	BB	432.959564	2437.276367SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.001264	BB	616.165344	3033.193359SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.001988	AA	1215.414185	286.087280SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.004243	AA	1740.072998	394.039276SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.012238	BB	431.440002	1212.087646SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.004738	AA	2813.072266	1324.685303SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.005166	AA	3806.763428	1177.657349SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.008161	AA	1587.209473	382.077484SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.002993	AA	3467.002686	797.274536SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.003803	AA	2252.028809	382.077484!sample_table_end
