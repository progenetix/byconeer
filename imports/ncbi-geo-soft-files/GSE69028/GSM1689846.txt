CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689846/suppl/GSM1689846_20090728_MART_MM_SNP28__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689846/suppl/GSM1689846_20090728_MART_MM_SNP28__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.001500	BB	598.774475	2557.276123SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.004429	BB	307.262085	942.990173SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.000778	BB	1268.439575	4433.477051SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.003456	BB	589.608154	1717.971558SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.006012	AA	1668.496460	388.714233SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.019337	AB	1570.129395	1457.723389SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.006219	BB	299.367950	1468.552124SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.001117	AA	1699.454590	557.475586SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.000534	AA	1313.243042	385.578766SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.002438	BB	536.768555	1676.855225SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.001100	BB	473.271820	2490.145508SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.009883	BB	713.203674	3855.004395SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.008581	AA	1436.496948	212.050354SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.000528	AB	1166.510742	1593.696899SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.013374	AB	873.035461	861.715576SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.007320	AA	3019.750977	1083.920532SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.000375	AA	3429.976807	930.551331SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.008831	AA	1680.872437	236.993256SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.014575	AA	4611.524414	1063.419556SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.003455	AA	2177.386230	331.600586!sample_table_end
