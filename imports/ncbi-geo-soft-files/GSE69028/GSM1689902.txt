CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689902/suppl/GSM1689902_20111212_MART_MM_SNP154_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689902/suppl/GSM1689902_20111212_MART_MM_SNP154_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.001915	BB	648.551270	2540.617432SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.010473	BB	394.694092	752.739258SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.002819	BB	1254.056152	3878.024414SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.004422	AB	1553.572632	942.790649SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.010418	AA	1295.083008	472.850830SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.003335	AA	1859.776855	347.178192SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.003241	AB	800.552490	674.061279SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.003375	AA	1877.511230	624.327881SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.006992	AA	2041.946045	527.965088SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.008805	BB	796.276123	2413.929688SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.004990	BB	424.250122	2669.679688SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.001491	BB	654.648010	2866.869385SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.002812	AA	1274.508911	305.476746SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.006666	AB	993.163513	1249.114136SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.017825	AB	514.238098	599.971436SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.000867	AA	2498.093994	1116.918701SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.001542	AA	3669.457275	939.800476SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.011424	AA	1286.347290	394.694092SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.021352	AA	3572.449951	1293.847778SNP_A-4268173	BB	0.003118	BB	266.253937	1473.151489!sample_table_end
