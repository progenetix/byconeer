CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689861/suppl/GSM1689861_20110714_MART_MM_SNP101__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689861/suppl/GSM1689861_20110714_MART_MM_SNP101__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.004550	AB	1269.400269	1282.876709SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.003285	BB	237.012772	717.349121SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.003022	BB	1381.253418	4770.511230SNP_A-4263484	AA	0.001624	AA	2264.774902	314.144073SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.002837	AA	1251.482056	300.217041SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.003440	AB	1170.322388	995.148865SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.009916	AB	1056.467773	653.526550SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.006018	AA	2057.993164	570.820435SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.001058	AB	954.273193	888.676392SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.002513	BB	660.376160	2253.405273SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.003187	BB	554.091980	2246.399658SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.001726	BB	610.796753	2632.695557SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.004448	AA	1478.223145	331.689056SNP_A-1997896	BB	0.003461	BB	503.695160	2487.252197SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.022553	AA	740.981750	343.309601SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.001785	AA	2111.386963	1058.197754SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.003720	AA	3171.228516	675.225464SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.010544	AA	1777.916870	370.645752SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.004653	AA	2889.680664	786.259766SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.003515	AA	1564.668091	317.089539!sample_table_end
