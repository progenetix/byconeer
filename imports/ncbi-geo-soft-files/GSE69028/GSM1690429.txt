CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690429/suppl/GSM1690429_20090728_MART_MM_SNP33_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690429/suppl/GSM1690429_20090728_MART_MM_SNP33_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.007136	BB	758.288574	3049.687500SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.003249	AB	641.114685	562.533142SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.002863	BB	1045.660156	4018.060059SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.006740	AB	1180.074707	980.193359SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.002544	AA	1181.512695	379.152161SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.013189	AA	2383.322510	248.557251SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.004045	BB	248.996796	1038.561035SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.003522	AA	1575.140869	574.105652SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.007935	AB	611.152649	612.642883SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.001064	AB	1476.955200	1195.762695SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.006849	AB	1886.733887	2017.526367SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.004992	BB	701.804810	3535.825195SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.003280	AA	1210.282104	301.860138SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.006978	AB	963.274658	1254.915894SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.003657	AA	935.648987	226.808044SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.002407	AA	2022.449707	1007.245361SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.001811	BB	1055.179321	3214.262451SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.001808	AA	1301.690430	301.860138SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.003525	AA	3334.261719	770.303162SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.002269	AA	1646.705688	332.758820!sample_table_end
