CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689901/suppl/GSM1689901_20111121_MART_MM_SNP145_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689901/suppl/GSM1689901_20111121_MART_MM_SNP145_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.004340	BB	386.004913	2161.110107SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.000637	BB	305.669678	789.885132SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.005049	BB	1135.833618	3541.928467SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.001423	AB	1447.949585	1000.899597SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.002158	AA	1169.556519	364.562775SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.004265	AB	1573.924805	1008.565979SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.006960	AB	700.313049	727.391541SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.002212	AA	1372.084351	431.227325SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.004678	AA	1798.012695	423.273590SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.003772	BB	605.397522	2332.482910SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.004813	BB	641.997742	2848.343506SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.007290	BB	453.416321	2567.285400SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.002341	AA	1174.221069	254.528931SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.003216	AB	1326.099365	1633.211426SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.006169	AB	610.360718	669.682007SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.006080	AA	2027.584229	741.048950SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.001850	AB	2760.748291	2706.606201SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.004527	AA	1173.744385	280.234375SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.002191	AA	3333.432861	810.722778SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.001488	AA	2075.014160	387.280212!sample_table_end
