CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690433/suppl/GSM1690433_20120510_MART_MM_SNP172_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690433/suppl/GSM1690433_20120510_MART_MM_SNP172_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.002124	BB	514.644836	2514.750977SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.019810	AB	760.426575	538.896179SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.006711	BB	1070.009033	4714.674805SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.001432	AB	1505.615967	1020.242004SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.013823	AA	1093.516846	475.083923SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.017951	AA	2798.802734	281.956909SNP_A-1980898	AA	0.009214	AA	1518.611450	184.709549SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.004337	AA	1160.764160	438.555481SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.004982	AB	1193.701660	1174.759033SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.001817	BB	574.708557	2126.350342SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.013188	BB	538.896179	3148.470703SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.002897	BB	608.279968	2513.812988SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.003141	AA	1090.921021	264.591827SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.005504	AA	1884.394165	429.465973SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.003510	BB	308.095734	912.454712SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.002387	AA	2537.898193	989.433533SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.000505	AA	3512.845703	923.272583SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.009321	AA	1740.361206	247.606506SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.011830	AA	3973.393311	729.054565SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.018908	AA	2727.286621	302.189606!sample_table_end
