CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689831/suppl/GSM1689831_20090520_MM10_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689831/suppl/GSM1689831_20090520_MM10_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6__-_Copia.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.002676	BB	687.099609	2481.430664SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.002910	BB	331.950409	887.457703SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001976	BB	1381.277344	4467.923340SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.009731	BB	334.931519	1114.999390SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.002282	AA	1449.451416	386.644836SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.007359	AA	2623.796631	325.519470SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.001482	BB	301.802643	1297.457764SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.008919	AA	1750.085449	668.113953SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.000908	AA	1308.785156	373.711548SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.006542	AB	1479.567383	946.736755SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.007058	AB	1158.811646	1775.595581SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.004827	BB	701.685669	3521.541016SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.003265	AA	1086.446899	256.720764SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.004844	AB	1148.526611	1808.812500SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.011971	AA	1108.430298	207.877304SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.018722	AA	2754.494385	1693.571655SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.003149	AA	2991.426270	791.198242SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.002139	AA	1303.124146	313.982300SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.006598	AA	4181.671387	1007.823792SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.002058	AA	2057.962646	322.964630!sample_table_end
