CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690425/suppl/GSM1690425_20111212_MART_MM_SNP157_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690425/suppl/GSM1690425_20111212_MART_MM_SNP157_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.001086	BB	501.886444	2201.347412SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.000851	BB	275.883636	763.702881SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.013808	BB	1169.171387	5330.350098SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.003733	BB	592.820740	1751.549072SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.010889	AA	947.190979	424.435791SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.002285	AA	2476.207031	394.594513SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.004333	BB	260.745850	1323.735474SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.002527	AA	1308.129639	422.627472SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.007333	AB	1398.101074	1071.656494SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.000347	AB	1458.323853	1276.485352SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.008016	AB	1929.034912	2028.061157SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.003893	BB	530.800049	2293.837646SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.008415	AA	1419.417236	354.013947SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.004700	AA	1909.606445	540.435486SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.000691	AB	672.174683	612.760498SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.008348	AA	2856.681152	911.533875SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.001021	AB	2684.851807	2763.860107SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.001522	AA	1540.144287	305.426086SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.000487	AA	3514.106201	902.921143SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.014234	AA	2684.711914	379.055267!sample_table_end
