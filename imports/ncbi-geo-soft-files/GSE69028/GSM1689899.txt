CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689899/suppl/GSM1689899_20111121_MART_MM_SNP142_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689899/suppl/GSM1689899_20111121_MART_MM_SNP142_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.011512	BB	427.365021	1174.499634SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.010438	BB	349.702271	619.545898SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.005736	BB	1419.845215	5080.752930SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.000516	AB	1470.490967	1104.879028SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.009506	AA	884.449097	289.740082SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.003286	AB	1178.841675	998.315613SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.005830	AB	896.504150	921.177490SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.002346	AA	1440.861572	435.591797SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.061247	AA	834.278687	456.418213SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.002630	BB	528.127625	1661.296509SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.002540	BB	416.100739	2178.154053SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.003170	BB	568.256653	2393.463379SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.007710	AA	1149.554199	327.873230SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.003092	AB	1227.031494	1738.252319SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.002241	AB	615.754578	581.043396SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.005930	AA	1732.948242	853.668701SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.005737	BB	991.517029	3600.853271SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.009684	AA	1517.133423	209.416504SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.005618	AA	2805.593750	775.506470SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.002271	AA	1625.422729	290.728241!sample_table_end
