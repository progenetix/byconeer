CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689889/suppl/GSM1689889_20110920_MART_MM_SNP123_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689889/suppl/GSM1689889_20110920_MART_MM_SNP123_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.010844	BB	389.786896	1210.060181SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.001205	BB	268.232208	723.366089SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001909	BB	1160.191284	3909.546387SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.008797	AB	1839.465210	1230.539795SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.000541	AA	1354.990234	342.912567SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.003685	AB	1143.808105	1000.106079SNP_A-1980898	AA	0.002799	AA	1251.462402	264.445251SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.002950	AA	1237.895264	430.595215SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.009144	AA	680.111938	309.747406SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.001893	AB	1333.147339	1206.542358SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.005178	AB	1170.628296	1636.582153SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.004664	BB	552.961426	3060.169434SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.005235	AA	1427.716187	230.907242SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.004741	AB	975.050781	1668.797485SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.001029	AA	875.843201	302.262878SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.000849	AA	2454.447510	1051.514160SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.009021	AA	2623.929688	593.828186SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.005282	AA	1465.079590	236.134750SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.001874	AA	3232.433594	940.200989SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.001922	AB	988.953369	866.821533!sample_table_end
