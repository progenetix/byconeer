CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689872/suppl/GSM1689872_20110905_MART_MM_SNP114__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689872/suppl/GSM1689872_20110905_MART_MM_SNP114__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.001225	BB	502.944550	2300.250977SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.004731	AB	589.120178	565.299194SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.011919	BB	1517.825562	3958.362061SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.004246	AB	1679.070801	1240.049316SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.004513	AA	1551.421387	312.949707SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.004756	AB	1175.638184	943.280640SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.001662	AB	858.497803	704.337891SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.002696	AA	1731.137817	594.756226SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.002230	AB	930.345947	1026.636963SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.004918	BB	673.883789	2460.562256SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.004795	BB	523.816772	2822.220459SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.003759	BB	508.676208	2642.725830SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.002430	AA	1417.157959	253.022171SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.003263	AB	1332.070312	1600.769897SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.000827	AB	662.016479	644.941772SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.005413	AA	1838.240479	809.177307SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.004246	AA	3884.515381	867.991333SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.003286	AA	1425.251099	253.022171SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.000372	AA	3458.627441	926.786743SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.001448	AA	1751.406982	380.140778!sample_table_end
