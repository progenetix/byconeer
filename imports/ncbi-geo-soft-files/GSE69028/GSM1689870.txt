CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689870/suppl/GSM1689870_20110905_MART_MM_SNP112__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689870/suppl/GSM1689870_20110905_MART_MM_SNP112__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.001582	BB	479.704498	2202.493164SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.000864	BB	286.175659	716.354858SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.006236	BB	1432.532715	3980.643066SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.000557	AB	1493.978271	1056.447510SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.003101	AA	1233.005005	297.463531SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.001515	AA	2024.995972	355.444611SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.003419	BB	324.735657	1407.313232SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.006971	AA	1503.086914	593.583557SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.003137	AA	1758.950317	461.312073SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.006127	BB	574.984558	2405.696289SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.002356	BB	593.583557	2432.080811SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.004723	BB	523.022583	2211.018555SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.008496	AA	1678.697388	358.240295SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.002155	AB	1110.995483	1408.662476SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.005057	AB	559.430115	566.325562SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.008722	AA	1540.421021	858.300354SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.003399	AA	3878.867432	954.144836SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.005027	AA	1315.088501	238.939346SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.002242	AA	3098.838867	883.291504SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.000373	AA	1937.165649	364.113647!sample_table_end
