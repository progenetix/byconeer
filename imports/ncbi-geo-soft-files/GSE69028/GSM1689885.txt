CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689885/suppl/GSM1689885_20110920_MART_MM_SNP118_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689885/suppl/GSM1689885_20110920_MART_MM_SNP118_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.006757	BB	447.440826	2791.630371SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.003296	BB	257.929779	620.156006SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004085	BB	988.318909	3906.106445SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.004265	AB	1671.709595	1247.908691SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.008209	AA	1689.755981	305.852600SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.002758	AA	1913.240967	356.447174SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.005278	BB	262.198303	968.118713SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.006339	AA	2002.057373	682.785645SNP_A-4265735	BB	0.003888	BB	689.347473	1695.855835SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.007420	AB	1721.079590	1629.343750SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.000451	AB	1492.195557	1806.565430SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.007113	BB	630.437317	2308.807617SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.015293	AA	2129.437012	340.800995SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.000765	AA	1557.742554	510.690308SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.003181	AB	599.459900	612.224487SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.005443	AA	1887.468750	787.968567SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.007120	AB	3123.433350	3006.456299SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.001404	AA	1434.788208	323.301239SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.002973	AA	3516.566895	1026.590332SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.019026	AA	1412.011475	378.349548!sample_table_end
