CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689890/suppl/GSM1689890_20110920_MART_MM_SNP124_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689890/suppl/GSM1689890_20110920_MART_MM_SNP124_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.002185	BB	472.201813	1972.822632SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.004517	BB	235.020218	601.888916SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004032	BB	1190.555542	3676.315918SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.007865	AB	1751.750732	1339.070190SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.002139	AA	1250.339233	311.397278SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.004562	AB	1080.952759	1009.310669SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.000828	AB	932.328186	757.031311SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.005083	AA	1358.134277	531.857483SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.005401	AA	831.605225	325.580444SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.002214	AB	1538.733887	1208.579346SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.001684	AB	1625.427856	1884.949829SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.001903	BB	612.522156	3089.158936SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.021508	AA	2157.175537	385.906158SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.000571	AA	1568.739990	468.752655SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.001752	AB	722.811707	688.842712SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.005480	AA	1864.021484	793.933411SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.002451	BB	1311.336182	3630.972656SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.008328	AA	1616.640991	229.112198SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.013403	AA	4212.063477	1209.581787SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.009174	AA	1499.845947	392.546936!sample_table_end
