CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689886/suppl/GSM1689886_20110920_MART_MM_SNP119_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689886/suppl/GSM1689886_20110920_MART_MM_SNP119_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.005691	BB	530.626343	2913.839111SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.002499	BB	257.621124	793.187134SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.005882	BB	1481.453247	4170.964355SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.007258	BB	653.153015	1729.861938SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.006209	AA	1660.930542	327.566772SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.000794	AB	1339.449219	1069.922363SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.001938	AB	832.901550	707.019958SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.006298	AA	2164.193359	677.239624SNP_A-4265735	BB	0.011889	BB	529.946777	1822.613770SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.003959	AB	1614.441772	1508.364502SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.004879	AB	1794.436401	2006.569580SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.004681	BB	741.471375	3157.414062SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.030271	AA	2065.702881	425.744019SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.006366	AA	1462.944458	629.301270SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.005287	AB	559.258789	575.615112SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.004913	AA	2112.829834	784.895142SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.001328	AB	2684.712158	2652.212646SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.004319	AA	1244.786865	255.678055SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.003376	AA	3449.603271	1032.110352SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.004874	AA	1547.830200	358.004181!sample_table_end
