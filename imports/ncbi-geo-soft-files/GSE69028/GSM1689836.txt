CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689836/suppl/GSM1689836_20090604_MM18_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689836/suppl/GSM1689836_20090604_MM18_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.001349	BB	550.943359	2494.879883SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.006993	AB	773.791870	636.487366SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001898	BB	1273.758423	4612.438965SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.002955	AB	1394.742920	1159.930542SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.007255	AA	1586.449463	435.968964SNP_A-4264431	BB	0.001907	BB	523.274048	1927.214600SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.013889	BB	229.482162	1489.621826SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.005961	AA	1532.088867	591.543518SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.001238	AB	982.437744	1008.850464SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.002211	AA	2133.361084	388.280273SNP_A-1995893	AA	0.001931	AA	2425.986328	1177.051025SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.004652	BB	614.123840	3321.482910SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.004017	AA	1666.925415	275.502594SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.001578	AA	1501.161377	442.806824SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.002391	AA	965.207214	258.897247SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.006417	AA	3034.819824	1207.167847SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.005025	AA	3646.616699	705.250183SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.004537	AA	1583.303345	351.233582SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.009776	AA	4245.962402	868.752136SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.014303	AA	2816.680664	570.047668!sample_table_end
