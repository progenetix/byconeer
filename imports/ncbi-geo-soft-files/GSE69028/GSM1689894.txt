CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689894/suppl/GSM1689894_20110920_MART_MM_SNP128_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689894/suppl/GSM1689894_20110920_MART_MM_SNP128_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.009113	BB	493.295685	1335.224487SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.005753	BB	222.302567	579.240234SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.002922	BB	1118.609253	4448.190430SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.006293	BB	585.850952	1954.416626SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.005284	AA	996.127258	326.417694SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.001851	AB	1270.415161	1031.144775SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.001102	BB	327.726654	1295.183960SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.002570	AA	1510.841064	444.098358SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.004368	AA	894.296265	316.696991SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.008507	AB	1101.728638	913.973572SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.009208	AB	1224.274658	1342.653564SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.007182	BB	519.074219	3049.888672SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.002653	AA	1322.297119	245.390762SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.002821	AB	1197.489624	1730.188721SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.004443	AA	937.894897	359.475189SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.001489	AA	2144.636230	987.991943SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.004907	AB	2214.823486	2301.473389SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.000325	AA	1425.392578	293.435547SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.005920	AA	2868.924072	947.890381SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.003625	AB	881.216187	910.353333!sample_table_end
