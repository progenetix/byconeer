CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689875/suppl/GSM1689875_20110920_MART_MM_SNP117__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689875/suppl/GSM1689875_20110920_MART_MM_SNP117__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.001873	BB	503.100891	2437.836182SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.003343	BB	276.001190	618.224426SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001735	BB	1126.678223	4261.856445SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.000226	AB	1473.420898	1089.581055SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.007447	AA	1178.141113	440.539062SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.002482	AA	1953.971924	331.178589SNP_A-1980898	AA	0.003470	AA	1250.584473	287.737976SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.007777	AA	2260.756348	692.660645SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.007990	AB	1311.252075	1258.571533SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.000847	AB	1476.701660	1321.718506SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.009349	AB	1894.069702	1767.897461SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.002361	BB	671.164185	2856.764404SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.004417	AA	1730.723633	309.550934SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.002875	AA	1406.949219	429.934723SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.006858	AB	535.197815	503.677277SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.001583	AA	2590.000000	1101.584595SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.001998	AB	2681.502930	2909.104980SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.006251	AA	1162.161743	251.024231SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.004131	AA	3312.212402	753.287964SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.004664	AA	2217.974121	301.192963!sample_table_end
