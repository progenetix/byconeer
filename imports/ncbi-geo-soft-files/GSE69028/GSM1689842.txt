CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689842/suppl/GSM1689842_20090728_MART_MM_SNP24bis__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689842/suppl/GSM1689842_20090728_MART_MM_SNP24bis__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.003387	BB	632.628967	2804.067139SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.008458	BB	389.127899	975.840149SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.000113	BB	1228.182251	4258.221191SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.001967	BB	524.605896	1735.444214SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.009057	AA	1772.459839	395.587036SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.001724	AA	2330.232422	347.754272SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.001477	AB	968.894226	791.147949SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.006738	AA	1158.996704	481.168488SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.003182	AA	1339.179199	331.205048SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.006362	BB	455.203369	1414.329224SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.000765	BB	499.720184	2347.425049SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.015599	BB	646.012634	3911.965820SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.002183	AA	1177.298340	279.225128SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.002766	AA	1769.322754	449.954742SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.006337	BB	533.953491	958.938782SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.012171	AA	3346.611084	1277.873657SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.009218	AB	2004.038208	2142.988770SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.003176	AA	1629.354736	300.469971SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.004607	AA	3997.365723	922.109131SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.003498	AA	2242.100586	394.665222!sample_table_end
