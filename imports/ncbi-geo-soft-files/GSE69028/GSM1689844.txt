CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689844/suppl/GSM1689844_20090728_MART_MM_SNP26__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689844/suppl/GSM1689844_20090728_MART_MM_SNP26__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.003977	AB	1821.657104	1854.884888SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.002165	BB	328.155762	851.416077SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004977	BB	964.705811	3709.679199SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.001116	BB	456.158325	1498.817749SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.001312	AA	1404.853271	335.288147SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.001107	AA	2141.373047	342.671570SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.000496	AB	879.904785	754.000427SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.003793	AA	1207.057251	449.762512SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.002647	AA	1063.090210	377.170197SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.002606	AB	1339.166016	1286.226440SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.009159	AB	1820.812744	2201.160400SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.011025	BB	840.378235	3598.658447SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.013881	AA	1109.266113	351.935455SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.002941	AA	1760.677979	570.431763SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.009850	AB	902.590210	763.721985SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.001474	AA	2393.704102	982.199158SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.002272	AA	3374.771240	750.851318SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.012990	AA	933.605652	276.731079SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.011151	AA	3816.328613	1198.571045SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.001293	AA	1744.119019	358.321106!sample_table_end
