CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689874/suppl/GSM1689874_20110920_MART_MM_SNP116__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689874/suppl/GSM1689874_20110920_MART_MM_SNP116__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.001982	BB	479.519287	1994.761230SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.001973	BB	322.892944	749.241699SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.002928	BB	1183.067505	3784.036133SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.001435	AB	1574.570068	1137.905884SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.002610	AA	1402.496338	309.761230SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.001428	AB	1336.761597	1034.597534SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.006200	BB	285.205963	940.508606SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.003527	AA	1945.515259	569.210205SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.003360	AA	1765.393799	490.217285SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.003130	AB	1584.889893	1468.086792SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.004055	AB	1261.527710	1546.407471SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.003693	BB	512.582581	2352.321533SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.006180	AA	1823.678223	314.755219SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.002601	AB	1136.813965	1384.936646SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.037683	AA	734.260620	353.294373SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.001934	AA	2148.960205	938.749695SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.003626	AB	2726.456299	3039.042725SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.004500	AA	1400.585327	356.834259SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.006360	AA	3245.193604	1069.990845SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.001748	AA	1691.449463	340.744690!sample_table_end
