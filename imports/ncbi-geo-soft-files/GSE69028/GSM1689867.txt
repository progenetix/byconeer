CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689867/suppl/GSM1689867_20110905_MART_MM_SNP109__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689867/suppl/GSM1689867_20110905_MART_MM_SNP109__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.005288	AB	1228.069580	1288.877319SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.004539	BB	239.964813	592.317688SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.002726	BB	1392.463013	4257.126465SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.001629	AB	1539.971802	1173.116943SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.016692	AA	1949.001099	333.233521SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.009033	AA	1901.113647	441.410034SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.005016	AB	1057.353760	770.830688SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.006050	AA	1627.449951	427.773651SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.000957	AA	1504.430054	415.953217SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.006991	BB	653.033691	2568.432861SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.003356	BB	459.792358	2109.806396SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.004212	BB	523.766357	2261.748535SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.000813	AA	1388.019287	269.228851SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.006571	AA	1420.854614	621.133606SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.007969	BB	254.269028	770.830688SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.001047	AA	2197.303711	1056.635498SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.003314	AB	2864.334961	2942.548828SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.002959	AA	1504.614502	262.299866SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.005386	AA	2785.220703	842.241150SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.011679	AA	1350.758301	257.793243!sample_table_end
