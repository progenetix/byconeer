CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689848/suppl/GSM1689848_20090728_MART_MM_SNP30__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689848/suppl/GSM1689848_20090728_MART_MM_SNP30__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.001620	BB	563.227844	2552.681885SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.007594	BB	266.541229	960.459351SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.000609	BB	1235.937988	4378.062988SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.001945	BB	490.152832	1710.690918SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.003125	AA	1114.167847	321.524231SNP_A-4264431	BB	0.013371	BB	507.931396	2261.720459SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.008249	AB	1073.296631	962.188171SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.002363	AA	1489.418701	533.659363SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.001104	AB	973.134216	1000.199341SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.002419	AB	1312.643555	1071.788086SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.000993	AB	1469.814697	1827.977051SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.011291	BB	602.508423	3618.775391SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.004046	AA	1088.200073	287.186218SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.003710	AA	1851.265381	475.337524SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.004801	AB	813.863464	729.262024SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.003503	AA	2800.939453	1146.484863SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.000750	AA	3300.547119	858.299988SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.007146	AA	1485.521484	223.224960SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.007881	AA	4233.102051	931.257507SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.004912	AA	2335.034180	400.181824!sample_table_end
