CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689853/suppl/GSM1689853_20100108_MART_MM_SNP50__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689853/suppl/GSM1689853_20100108_MART_MM_SNP50__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.008121	AB	1934.605103	2275.858643SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.019805	BB	393.708954	1196.290161SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004303	BB	1138.423584	3612.130371SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.005144	AB	1393.898315	864.553223SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.001508	AA	1248.217651	373.891754SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.004982	AA	2617.350098	435.331024SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.005382	BB	259.638306	1361.011353SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.004997	AA	1383.693970	386.781738SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.005132	AA	1775.267578	405.128204SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.000619	AB	1476.417114	1300.369873SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.000450	AB	1525.852173	1815.361938SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.002088	BB	675.401001	2930.535156SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.005443	AA	975.983276	239.886581SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.002146	AA	1435.327759	498.737488SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.006318	AB	795.678955	783.086487SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.002202	AA	2207.742188	914.322937SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.002663	AB	2501.937256	2423.186523SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.005894	AA	1155.202759	325.369354SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.001320	AA	3534.305908	970.335388SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.003509	AA	1561.313965	311.861542!sample_table_end
