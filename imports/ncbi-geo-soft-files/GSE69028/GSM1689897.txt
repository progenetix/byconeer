CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689897/suppl/GSM1689897_20111121_MART_MM_SNP139_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689897/suppl/GSM1689897_20111121_MART_MM_SNP139_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.006927	BB	445.595276	1451.779907SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.024037	BB	291.195007	439.776306SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.005840	BB	1346.208008	3789.461914SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.004443	BB	379.054596	1386.656738SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.004659	AA	1041.506958	313.310242SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.005932	AA	1788.100220	386.957336SNP_A-1980898	AA	0.009597	AA	1094.305420	222.308899SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.004174	AA	1477.419189	414.490387SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.005606	AB	754.292542	683.582031SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.003005	AB	1274.045898	1141.528931SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.008063	AB	1177.009888	1388.490723SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.012199	BB	417.816711	1719.456055SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.001970	AA	1443.771118	260.420959SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.002587	AB	1077.133301	1674.323364SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.005661	AA	710.771179	273.514496SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.008740	AA	1538.546509	878.717896SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.002674	AA	3732.328857	862.441711SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.005392	AA	1327.026978	234.912964SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.008048	AA	2656.821777	902.289368SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.011263	AA	1424.231201	336.650208!sample_table_end
