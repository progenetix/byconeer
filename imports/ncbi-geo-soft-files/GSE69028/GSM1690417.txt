CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690417/suppl/GSM1690417_20111121_MART_MM_SNP138_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690417/suppl/GSM1690417_20111121_MART_MM_SNP138_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.011445	AB	984.851624	886.890381SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.006410	AB	553.809692	441.268707SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001409	BB	1280.166260	4544.985352SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.005141	AB	1635.791260	986.630249SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.023416	AA	864.363770	483.817932SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.006004	AA	2070.446777	276.351440SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.003686	AB	966.842102	892.251404SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.002621	AA	1362.019043	494.493378SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.001216	AA	1346.419434	370.087006SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.002190	AB	1440.244385	1387.136475SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.001484	AB	1375.369507	1691.870728SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.012640	BB	378.449921	2259.574951SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.003089	AA	1650.793091	291.618164SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.013569	AA	2187.847900	584.736572SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.004212	AB	643.225525	688.566101SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.002189	AA	2053.718750	969.885498SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.006090	AA	3942.419434	806.823425SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.005268	AA	1261.151611	242.023285SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.006001	AA	3123.914307	706.353271SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.000623	AA	1881.918335	318.646149!sample_table_end
