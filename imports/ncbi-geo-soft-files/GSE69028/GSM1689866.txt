CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689866/suppl/GSM1689866_20110905_MART_MM_SNP108__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689866/suppl/GSM1689866_20110905_MART_MM_SNP108__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.003567	BB	422.155090	2310.983643SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.006112	BB	256.020538	541.321838SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001221	BB	1144.135376	4101.814453SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.004660	AB	1717.318359	1144.135376SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.002997	AA	1486.451172	393.366150SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.004368	AA	1910.396729	297.697052SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.007338	BB	405.859436	1174.263428SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.004073	AA	1837.556396	512.927551SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.002582	AA	1375.583496	465.195587SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.004379	AA	2336.967773	527.756165SNP_A-1995893	AA	0.002919	AA	2520.882568	1050.654297SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.009752	BB	515.230103	3171.535156SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.013239	AA	2083.069336	324.864227SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.002328	AA	1465.419312	532.306030SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.003447	AA	746.003357	245.577988SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.002706	AA	2091.296875	1124.973022SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.001422	AA	3489.288330	820.701965SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.002752	AA	1532.016724	335.958771SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.003233	AA	3003.810547	821.262573SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.004398	AB	873.120422	695.571655!sample_table_end
