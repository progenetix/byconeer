CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689854/suppl/GSM1689854_20100205_MART_MM_SNP35__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689854/suppl/GSM1689854_20100205_MART_MM_SNP35__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.028784	BB	1070.660889	2972.824463SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.008373	AB	758.022217	588.386841SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.003268	BB	1342.923706	4011.809570SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.002541	AB	1552.101196	1005.471497SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.009587	AA	1802.662354	372.746826SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.002396	AA	2337.039795	337.206268SNP_A-1980898	AA	0.000688	AA	1325.513916	259.689392SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.017014	AA	2479.401367	817.780457SNP_A-4265735	BB	0.031553	BB	450.606293	1143.028198SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.005957	AB	1675.893921	1252.052612SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.011232	AB	1731.934692	2259.600098SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.007647	BB	756.810852	3746.349609SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.004224	AA	1160.597900	231.139145SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.000575	AB	1147.118652	1506.594971SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.006324	AA	1093.631348	268.073914SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.026135	AA	2110.153320	1558.450073SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.006030	AA	2960.318359	1026.707031SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.001959	AA	1557.054199	314.800293SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.001862	AA	3723.071533	960.280640SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.004131	AA	1538.872803	317.253662!sample_table_end
