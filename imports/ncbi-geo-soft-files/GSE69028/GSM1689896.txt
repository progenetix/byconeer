CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689896/suppl/GSM1689896_20110920_MART_MM_SNP131_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689896/suppl/GSM1689896_20110920_MART_MM_SNP131_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.007800	BB	528.568970	1444.968750SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.003695	BB	280.077393	610.561340SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.002010	BB	1240.130737	3953.389648SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.014293	BB	604.875183	2204.616699SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.010764	AA	1790.422119	419.077850SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.001856	AA	1990.601440	348.292786SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.004148	AB	1016.913086	889.203186SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.010959	AA	770.363586	290.291016SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.010028	AA	619.719299	280.783386SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.002387	AB	1424.439575	1069.897705SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.002827	AB	1285.442261	1677.033447SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.005480	BB	760.775757	3433.711670SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.001766	AA	1463.006226	265.166504SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.004234	AB	1337.016846	1717.850220SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.005202	AA	1091.621216	313.500214SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.002126	AA	2168.116699	1135.885742SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.009162	AA	2619.237061	909.167664SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.000793	AA	1489.054077	305.495087SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.001127	AA	3273.270752	914.708313SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.023410	AA	1360.397339	345.467712!sample_table_end
