CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690421/suppl/GSM1690421_20111121_MART_MM_SNP147_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690421/suppl/GSM1690421_20111121_MART_MM_SNP147_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.001528	BB	517.036011	2015.679565SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.003598	BB	260.632965	608.375122SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.005905	BB	1447.728271	5087.194824SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.005572	AB	1222.373779	1029.778442SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.007784	AA	1019.350342	268.502319SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.002126	AA	1965.211914	354.656158SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.005358	AB	736.200012	749.514587SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.003181	AA	1377.688721	411.922943SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.002025	AB	904.626831	830.050537SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.000989	AB	1453.189087	1323.757935SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.006565	AB	1631.299316	1562.769409SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.003358	BB	567.010437	2374.242676SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.002453	AA	1382.692139	311.073273SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.003138	AA	1398.922974	522.653259SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.004678	AB	569.858887	530.660706SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.005903	AA	2381.280273	790.518799SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.013269	AB	3353.517334	3189.525391SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.003737	AA	1650.391724	294.445953SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.000906	AA	3466.766357	869.096497SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.000977	AA	1967.456421	334.655731!sample_table_end
