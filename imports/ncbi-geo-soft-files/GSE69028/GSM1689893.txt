CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689893/suppl/GSM1689893_20110920_MART_MM_SNP127_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689893/suppl/GSM1689893_20110920_MART_MM_SNP127_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.010349	BB	630.006348	1522.620728SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.003956	BB	234.155426	759.295105SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.003162	BB	1127.032104	4504.687500SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.027939	AB	1256.340088	1457.250977SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.003973	AA	1064.782837	363.354675SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.004002	AA	2335.922119	436.898132SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.000703	BB	313.815979	1180.128418SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.010865	AA	1769.367065	425.218109SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.003933	AB	628.442749	786.384094SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.001222	AB	1375.884399	1137.937866SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.005563	AB	1184.093140	1510.372314SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.004450	BB	679.568665	3469.116943SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.001635	AA	1389.358521	302.847626SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.005106	AB	1202.845093	1825.756958SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.006309	AA	1108.185669	343.875580SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.002880	AA	2575.006348	1269.145142SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.000824	AA	3435.884277	962.577515SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.001844	AA	1300.477295	289.251038SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.003777	AA	3924.979004	920.805298SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.001951	AB	999.094421	842.991394!sample_table_end
