CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689887/suppl/GSM1689887_20110920_MART_MM_SNP120_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689887/suppl/GSM1689887_20110920_MART_MM_SNP120_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.003348	BB	478.912659	2559.056396SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.001479	BB	295.444336	698.887634SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004831	BB	1375.013794	3936.221436SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.005623	BB	624.395081	1818.540405SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.002090	AA	1451.214478	329.914276SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.006473	AB	1343.307617	904.009155SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.001204	AB	886.344849	806.058533SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.006699	AA	2209.312988	661.437622SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.003761	AA	1382.029053	485.456787SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.002284	AB	1581.245117	1367.761475SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.005459	AB	1215.440308	1784.102783SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.004049	BB	495.035431	2470.473145SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.017412	AA	2177.916260	309.309875SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.006086	AB	1043.277588	1251.104004SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.015043	AA	612.848572	266.700775SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.004084	AA	2048.042480	1176.614868SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.005944	AA	3965.900146	830.419739SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.000432	AA	1414.627563	306.697906SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.001906	AA	3138.478760	864.359558SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.003670	AB	935.854492	1058.691284!sample_table_end
