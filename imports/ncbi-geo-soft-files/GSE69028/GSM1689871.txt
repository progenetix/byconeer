CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689871/suppl/GSM1689871_20110905_MART_MM_SNP113__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689871/suppl/GSM1689871_20110905_MART_MM_SNP113__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.002309	BB	450.323395	2079.285156SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.008463	AB	484.444946	436.252106SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004452	BB	1453.954956	4234.814453SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.006102	AB	1442.184082	850.262390SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.005946	AA	1427.991089	271.652374SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.003500	AA	1852.731812	330.376892SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.000741	BB	293.504700	1185.079102SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.001371	AA	1708.368652	565.040955SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.001245	AA	1457.741699	390.824402SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.004838	BB	713.753723	2404.241699SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.000800	BB	521.677795	2379.344238SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.004265	BB	491.177734	2394.146729SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.004576	AA	1534.539551	333.219177SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.006014	AA	1636.499512	649.046021SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.002677	BB	365.886963	849.084717SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.007070	AA	1806.507080	734.014648SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.007535	BB	1479.449707	4017.342529SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.000831	AA	1493.340210	298.609833SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.005903	AA	2752.415039	858.463501SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.002427	AA	1640.030640	338.323120!sample_table_end
