CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689843/suppl/GSM1689843_20090728_MART_MM_SNP25__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689843/suppl/GSM1689843_20090728_MART_MM_SNP25__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.006981	BB	467.560089	2867.377197SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.002666	BB	332.252869	873.470520SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.038595	BB	718.076477	5074.224609SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.003856	BB	552.745117	1848.305176SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.001539	AA	1401.902832	379.148468SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.002166	AB	1336.859497	1158.782593SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.007448	BB	424.182404	1381.985107SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.002653	AA	1731.353516	499.944641SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.007894	AA	969.318359	426.725281SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.013474	AB	1001.348450	815.433960SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.006616	AB	1385.938354	1434.152344SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.006455	BB	552.070251	3178.296875SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.005066	AA	1095.177246	300.423340SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.013584	AB	723.070251	1437.400757SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.002312	AA	819.046021	236.031082SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.004627	AA	2809.871094	1042.512573SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.000839	AA	3550.701416	953.519226SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.027320	AA	2051.645264	396.241394SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.007731	AA	4074.696289	841.548157SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.000871	AB	1124.533203	922.557678!sample_table_end
