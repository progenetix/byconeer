CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689845/suppl/GSM1689845_20090728_MART_MM_SNP27__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689845/suppl/GSM1689845_20090728_MART_MM_SNP27__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.008854	AB	1982.900513	2297.788818SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.002184	BB	329.804260	771.117798SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004981	BB	1217.674072	3625.250000SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.001302	AB	1567.349243	1133.120483SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.003319	AA	1560.948975	355.450470SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.012365	AA	2335.786865	503.579193SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.001270	BB	280.768982	1183.723999SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.010281	AA	843.811768	379.470764SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.003370	AB	1211.503052	1090.380615SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.004355	AB	1326.143066	939.893250SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.002474	BB	394.128143	2267.596680SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.007666	BB	793.468262	3339.299805SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.002677	AA	1282.689819	305.037903SNP_A-1997896	BB	0.000867	BB	675.414185	2563.776367SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.005044	AA	1076.231079	282.574036SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.008537	AA	3093.287598	1400.387085SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.018096	AB	1864.428833	1836.547241SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.008314	AA	1748.338135	357.143250SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.004085	AA	3971.300781	943.352234SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.003630	AA	2296.224365	519.666687!sample_table_end
