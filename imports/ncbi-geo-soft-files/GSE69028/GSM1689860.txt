CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689860/suppl/GSM1689860_20110714_MART_MM_SNP100__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689860/suppl/GSM1689860_20110714_MART_MM_SNP100__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.004998	BB	383.518188	1759.757080SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.003289	BB	279.006134	621.488281SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.003586	BB	1361.682861	4025.612305SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.009925	AB	1279.507202	1250.851196SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.004807	AA	1051.167480	378.669067SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.011570	AA	1598.875366	402.279114SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.006376	BB	261.131866	932.653992SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.002811	AA	1358.955444	497.254089SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.011655	AB	934.652283	648.624390SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.080817	AA	2163.133545	1284.258545SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.011574	AB	1737.099121	1525.569580SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.006788	BB	472.541901	2698.866943SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.006701	AA	1706.964111	255.469315SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.017163	AB	1035.264160	997.260132SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.008182	AA	652.032471	250.974564SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.004885	AA	1846.497925	842.539551SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.048641	AB	1912.567139	2904.180420SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.003460	AA	1546.197266	343.425171SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.004029	AA	2910.453125	871.083008SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.016301	AA	1418.387085	369.998779!sample_table_end
