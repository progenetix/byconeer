CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689839/suppl/GSM1689839_20090604_MM22_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689839/suppl/GSM1689839_20090604_MM22_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.001940	BB	567.472595	1992.132568SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.003280	BB	347.079865	854.059570SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.005716	BB	942.395874	4105.759766SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.005927	BB	524.762573	1272.538574SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.003826	AA	1133.271240	299.689148SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.006763	AB	1686.094116	1298.394409SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.005942	BB	219.033951	1208.343750SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.006300	AA	1076.116699	338.874603SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.006521	AA	1312.615601	508.158325SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.006356	AB	1168.961792	1132.694214SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.001527	AB	1371.949097	1736.933716SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.003520	BB	508.669220	2576.621582SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.003975	AA	1043.699219	268.743744SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.002810	AA	1629.447021	402.399963SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.005307	AB	566.277100	512.331055SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.010539	AA	2073.807129	1391.292725SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.001950	AA	3260.316895	764.386597SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.006651	AA	1146.301758	250.647812SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.001468	AA	3296.666260	839.198425SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.001427	AA	1997.462280	322.632721!sample_table_end
