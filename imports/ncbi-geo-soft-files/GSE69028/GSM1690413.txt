CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690413/suppl/GSM1690413_20111212_MART_MM_SNP165_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690413/suppl/GSM1690413_20111212_MART_MM_SNP165_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.001632	BB	546.006775	2525.384766SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.001299	BB	294.116058	829.462646SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004077	BB	1123.352905	3629.458984SNP_A-4263484	AA	0.003598	AA	2412.941895	407.985504SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.007992	AA	1483.544678	454.474976SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.001593	AA	2294.721436	401.592712SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.006403	BB	238.970200	948.598022SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.006044	AA	1766.273560	645.117004SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.001830	AB	1042.710083	911.592529SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.000299	AB	1455.651123	1271.846313SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.002404	AB	1334.132324	1766.212891SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.001770	BB	655.969849	2834.937256SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.003860	AA	1685.500732	284.877502SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.006963	AA	1237.848389	534.346069SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.000657	AB	690.520508	654.778442SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.003189	AA	2019.095093	1103.223877SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.000957	AB	2594.469482	2807.988525SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.003677	AA	1203.841064	294.736572SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.009118	AA	3102.228760	1090.958008SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.003171	AB	1120.764160	1259.342529!sample_table_end
