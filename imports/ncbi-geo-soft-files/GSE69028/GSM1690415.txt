CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690415/suppl/GSM1690415_20120510_MART_MM_SNP173_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690415/suppl/GSM1690415_20120510_MART_MM_SNP173_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.003253	BB	444.464722	2394.424072SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.001975	BB	272.780243	817.974304SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.006300	BB	1568.501099	4617.051758SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.009684	AB	1859.043701	1252.350342SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.003858	AA	1581.583252	344.890503SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.011820	AA	2557.135498	505.601471SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.000909	BB	332.977142	1260.453735SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.000564	AA	1602.070801	502.174072SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.001247	AA	1553.646606	441.836426SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.015594	BB	737.724670	2940.513184SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.004462	BB	621.615845	2838.538086SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.008011	BB	676.818298	2455.290039SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.008060	AA	1193.573364	334.873657SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.003706	AB	1348.856812	1616.009766SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.002701	AB	712.322205	568.289124SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.009405	AB	1322.277954	1494.276123SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.002557	AB	2402.740723	2427.810303SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.005546	AA	1195.276611	251.068222SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.010755	AA	3549.811035	1180.556641SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.001677	AB	1057.640625	1077.282959!sample_table_end
