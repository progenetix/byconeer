CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689849/suppl/GSM1689849_20090728_MART_MM_SNP31__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689849/suppl/GSM1689849_20090728_MART_MM_SNP31__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.012607	BB	907.934631	2803.852783SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.010407	BB	175.600113	579.197937SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.005788	BB	946.962891	3599.751953SNP_A-4263484	AA	0.005205	AA	1930.253784	278.923706SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.010619	AA	1828.020264	384.203735SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.001202	AA	2206.916992	391.277740SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.004789	BB	304.377899	995.622742SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.006949	AA	1780.680176	460.730469SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.426672	AB	620.386169	465.006531SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.011490	AB	1033.507690	971.269470SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.002537	AB	1365.115356	1598.951172SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.004875	BB	746.131775	3182.365723SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.005149	AA	1202.752075	222.566757SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.002031	AA	1537.621582	550.046753SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.003390	AB	699.193848	545.852783SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.001494	AA	2365.969482	1177.839233SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.010020	AA	3151.021729	1225.079468SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.013319	AA	1249.852783	400.346741SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.003587	AA	3786.422363	854.747498SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.004767	AB	1016.341309	695.226868!sample_table_end
