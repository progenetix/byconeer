CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690419/suppl/GSM1690419_20090520_MM9_SNP6.0_GenomeWideSNP_6_-_Copia.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690419/suppl/GSM1690419_20090520_MM9_SNP6.0_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.009082	BB	767.383484	3215.965088SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.016660	AB	816.191711	617.725403SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001005	BB	1199.639648	4061.465820SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.008428	AB	1312.192505	782.751099SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.008016	AA	966.604492	279.379303SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.016169	AA	2930.817871	320.881317SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.003841	BB	283.350525	1364.818481SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.000147	AA	1579.775391	513.880310SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.002148	AA	1333.207886	348.672180SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.001714	BB	582.454956	1776.388550SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.007930	BB	487.324951	1910.752563SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.001511	BB	669.618713	3077.175537SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.008903	AA	1723.242432	359.212646SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.008624	AB	1300.475464	1922.911133SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.007952	AB	779.987488	810.040039SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.000642	AA	2465.838135	1101.079590SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.003212	AB	2227.350830	2609.648926SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.003597	AA	1290.384277	334.591583SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.005099	AA	3449.376465	1074.007324SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.010601	AB	1714.675903	1279.758911!sample_table_end
