CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689863/suppl/GSM1689863_20110714_MART_MM_SNP99bis__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689863/suppl/GSM1689863_20110714_MART_MM_SNP99bis__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	NC	0.190185	AB	1384.837280	324.942871SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.010225	BB	257.010834	474.624146SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.017086	BB	928.728821	2793.295898SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.010691	BB	410.873260	1020.557556SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.009597	AA	962.038452	261.470886SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.022500	AA	1100.428833	289.458435SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.015876	BB	255.819366	735.096497SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.005428	AA	1192.609497	476.458191SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.028531	AB	360.015442	862.870789SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.022898	AA	1594.135864	466.537903SNP_A-1995893	AA	0.049191	AA	1465.262207	971.458923SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.008608	BB	432.676453	1989.428223SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.006807	AA	1175.038086	325.396820SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.014961	AA	975.874512	450.903473SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.011917	AA	615.005615	253.190811SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.015041	AA	1262.856689	816.755127SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.012779	AA	2389.012695	824.544373SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.019591	AA	819.602112	268.450684SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.027330	AA	1848.087158	691.570496SNP_A-4268173	BB	0.044084	BB	301.370758	938.529480!sample_table_end
