CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689832/suppl/GSM1689832_20090520_MM13_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689832/suppl/GSM1689832_20090520_MM13_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6__-_Copia.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.010886	BB	830.244141	2212.909912SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.003779	BB	269.301605	874.184082SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001908	BB	1120.275024	3945.548340SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.002393	BB	461.840607	1685.105103SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.000955	AA	1283.522949	331.489349SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.004413	AA	2440.655518	325.052856SNP_A-1980898	AA	0.002248	AA	1328.920288	314.216919SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.001789	AA	1465.442505	450.072083SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.003506	AA	972.617126	355.965729SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.007180	AA	1776.848511	440.590668SNP_A-1995893	AA	0.003199	AA	2030.719116	1016.200012SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.005355	BB	690.969971	3554.235596SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.012522	AA	1026.903931	182.103195SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.004905	AA	1368.872437	564.556641SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.004248	AA	1064.793335	310.405792SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.014937	AA	2823.349609	1633.371704SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.005358	AA	3053.236084	1048.021118SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.003123	AA	1396.005249	254.533279SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.008688	AA	4128.700684	1129.849365SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.000414	AA	1940.347412	402.650970!sample_table_end
