CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689862/suppl/GSM1689862_20110714_MART_MM_SNP98bis__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689862/suppl/GSM1689862_20110714_MART_MM_SNP98bis__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.004046	AB	1304.007324	1352.986206SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.001452	BB	267.885773	773.335205SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.000771	BB	1211.007568	4106.278809SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.000834	BB	523.544373	1608.047852SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.003914	AA	1138.332520	297.161804SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.002269	AB	1381.598999	1006.681152SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.002584	BB	276.898315	1074.297607SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.003888	AA	2014.552490	605.815430SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.001368	AB	1076.541748	984.766113SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.015146	AA	2517.551758	419.107941SNP_A-1995893	AA	0.001750	AA	2475.182861	1088.675903SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.002287	BB	539.600952	2677.682617SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.009685	AA	1883.945679	350.810974SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.000414	AA	1591.932373	472.824677SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.007802	AA	722.922607	299.680603SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.004080	AA	1876.456665	1020.317200SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.003443	AA	3825.262451	877.267090SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.002606	AA	1273.563599	277.744904SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.003286	AA	3326.626221	776.551636SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.002366	AB	1013.455261	1075.301025!sample_table_end
