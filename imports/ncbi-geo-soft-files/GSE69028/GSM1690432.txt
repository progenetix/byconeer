CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690432/suppl/GSM1690432_20111121_MART_MM_SNP144_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690432/suppl/GSM1690432_20111121_MART_MM_SNP144_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.002727	BB	447.631561	2306.889404SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.002350	BB	315.670563	878.509399SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.002487	BB	1401.675049	4373.951172SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.008546	AB	1802.297607	1318.485962SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.003530	AA	1547.083374	332.399902SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.005076	AA	2405.237305	449.968781SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.000591	BB	312.464874	1185.027588SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.004799	AA	1402.333740	542.286865SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.004016	AA	1765.205200	425.850800SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.011505	AB	1838.303467	1676.888916SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.001821	AB	1646.109741	1832.808105SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.001489	BB	564.687988	2614.339844SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.005933	AA	1427.868530	226.326660SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.004021	AB	1350.891235	1668.627441SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.004475	AA	780.499878	308.122864SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.001941	AA	2303.402344	935.823853SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.007780	AA	4201.369141	957.565613SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.006098	AA	1566.179321	239.036987SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.000669	AA	3320.084961	900.009888SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.002293	AB	1063.098389	1139.913330!sample_table_end
