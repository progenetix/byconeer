CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689847/suppl/GSM1689847_20090728_MART_MM_SNP29__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689847/suppl/GSM1689847_20090728_MART_MM_SNP29__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.002527	AB	1613.727783	1386.683105SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.004783	AB	565.388489	492.719147SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001958	BB	1311.556274	4102.236816SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.007408	BB	436.274719	1128.573364SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.000952	AA	1404.885010	359.967957SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.002261	AA	2251.199707	329.033661SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.001128	BB	336.148163	1223.620972SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.004173	AA	1600.172241	441.963409SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.022160	AA	782.232910	407.630371SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.001403	AA	2031.026489	402.347015SNP_A-1995893	AA	0.002091	AA	2183.219482	939.187256SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.007290	BB	749.691895	2921.487793SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.005058	AA	1006.193420	277.855530SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.000841	AA	1657.000977	472.201385SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.006831	AA	1112.392334	275.871307SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.002101	AA	2056.378906	1010.634949SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.004125	AA	2893.178955	819.800598SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.002550	AA	1370.471802	261.942841SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.008842	AA	2930.411377	1042.497681SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.001878	AA	1662.438354	305.336334!sample_table_end
