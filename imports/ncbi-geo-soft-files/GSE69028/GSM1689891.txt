CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689891/suppl/GSM1689891_20110920_MART_MM_SNP125_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689891/suppl/GSM1689891_20110920_MART_MM_SNP125_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.004559	BB	590.622620	1763.499146SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.000543	BB	294.287872	795.182373SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.003137	BB	1031.871338	3991.306885SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.010807	BB	525.480835	2087.771484SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.001030	AA	1330.426880	373.846313SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.001653	AA	2018.432373	344.584656SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.002572	AB	981.729614	741.872986SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.004275	AA	1359.766724	521.802490SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.010920	AB	606.074158	568.942688SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.005011	BB	563.540588	1517.777588SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.005995	BB	406.746063	1935.500610SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.002714	BB	679.372009	3296.860352SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.000613	AA	1404.154419	273.636658SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.001432	AB	1067.042969	1565.595215SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.009839	AB	895.643982	777.093445SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.001700	AA	2455.774902	991.474243SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.003056	AA	3061.015137	737.504944SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.007587	AA	1614.246094	234.226822SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.000233	AA	3481.151367	914.767944SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.010787	AA	1412.916382	319.059357!sample_table_end
