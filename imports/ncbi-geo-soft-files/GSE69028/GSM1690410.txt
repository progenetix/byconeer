CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690410/suppl/GSM1690410_20090520_MM11_SNP6.0_GenomeWideSNP_6_-_Copia.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690410/suppl/GSM1690410_20090520_MM11_SNP6.0_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.011102	BB	860.235962	2386.361572SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.011018	BB	406.648102	1003.067383SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.002812	BB	1422.775635	4428.981934SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.002842	AB	1617.256104	1060.407837SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.015754	AA	1772.631104	474.123962SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.029891	AA	3169.443848	304.124847SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.003042	BB	314.463440	1384.508423SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.009248	AA	1953.659912	493.581940SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.001674	AA	1369.784790	446.833771SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.005821	AB	1611.762085	1132.970703SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.006184	AB	1379.008667	1989.173950SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.005278	BB	633.193054	3423.622559SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.001733	AA	1323.843018	299.187714SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.001320	AB	1182.109253	1647.397949SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.014233	AA	1259.529419	326.358093SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.026080	AA	3315.742920	1787.717407SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.001580	AB	2589.323975	2541.694580SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.006623	AA	1315.942993	367.471954SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.020118	AA	4152.521973	1299.099243SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.006771	AB	1592.684082	1268.839233!sample_table_end
