CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689829/suppl/GSM1689829_20090121_MM05_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689829/suppl/GSM1689829_20090121_MM05_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6__-_Copia.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.005028	BB	755.547546	2435.588867SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.008642	BB	299.449921	1025.697144SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004988	BB	1312.592041	4979.751953SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.025702	AB	1865.167725	856.578613SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.004147	AA	1532.002686	313.157745SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.018891	AA	3068.267090	516.863159SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.016732	AB	1231.939697	820.500732SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.004615	AA	1987.811401	564.246765SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.019874	AB	1462.459229	862.061951SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.002008	AA	2194.271484	457.546875SNP_A-1995893	AA	0.002958	AA	2576.361816	1151.078003SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.003170	BB	522.696838	2686.756836SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.003545	AA	1308.553711	236.880859SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.022045	AA	2327.807373	462.028870SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.032736	AA	1011.750061	466.155640SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.004780	AA	2614.155273	911.332275SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.034424	AA	3455.088135	1626.231567SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.005327	AA	1420.358154	234.012772SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.007807	AA	3846.990723	1142.635498SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.017831	AA	2752.839844	959.063721!sample_table_end
