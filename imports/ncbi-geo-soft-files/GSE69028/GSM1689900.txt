CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689900/suppl/GSM1689900_20111121_MART_MM_SNP143_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689900/suppl/GSM1689900_20111121_MART_MM_SNP143_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.009631	BB	386.204437	1286.616943SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.321012	AA	634.118652	215.721405SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.000960	BB	1254.407227	4125.248535SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.000397	BB	506.819031	1599.773438SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.004478	AA	1027.336060	336.726471SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.003949	AA	1821.600220	353.436523SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.002532	BB	298.893829	1074.308960SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.003954	AA	1326.521484	505.453156SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.006934	AB	600.167603	638.272278SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.001593	BB	565.918274	1766.941040SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.002820	BB	443.536194	2141.407227SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.007361	BB	583.380432	2142.553955SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.003179	AA	1099.794312	274.244476SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.008191	AB	1441.769043	1438.918091SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.007135	AB	672.695557	492.152466SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.005575	AA	1777.180420	839.133301SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.001278	AA	3226.403076	894.928223SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.005626	AA	1215.799072	245.555984SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.004390	AA	2870.836914	853.402039SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.031462	AA	1300.050781	311.499786!sample_table_end
