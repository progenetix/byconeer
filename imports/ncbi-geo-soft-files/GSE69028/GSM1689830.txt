CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689830/suppl/GSM1689830_20090121_MM06_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689830/suppl/GSM1689830_20090121_MM06_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6__-_Copia.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.004188	AB	1804.258301	1685.776367SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.008567	BB	310.334991	1034.072021SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.006637	BB	1296.250000	5098.726074SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.005522	BB	363.078735	1330.629150SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.003710	AA	1381.947754	292.015686SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.013054	AB	1888.438354	1376.247070SNP_A-1980898	AA	0.006574	AA	1513.203125	218.373810SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.003600	AA	1658.566162	594.383423SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.002446	AB	1125.236328	957.780518SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.007738	AB	1765.206543	1419.591553SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.011835	AB	2007.226807	2174.456299SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.001944	BB	683.021179	3108.025635SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.002518	AA	1137.793091	270.898010SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.003302	AA	1829.900635	475.454041SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.002148	AB	699.103760	575.537048SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.001828	AA	2595.647461	1187.696533SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.005432	AB	3008.000732	3021.458984SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.005561	AA	1588.156128	361.095367SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.003310	AA	3240.321777	774.197021SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.010261	AA	2571.413086	394.741394!sample_table_end
