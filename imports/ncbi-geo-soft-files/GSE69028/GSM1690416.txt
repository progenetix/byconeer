CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690416/suppl/GSM1690416_20111212_MART_MM_SNP155_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690416/suppl/GSM1690416_20111212_MART_MM_SNP155_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.002095	BB	463.674774	2257.014893SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.000943	BB	275.811340	771.791809SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.012868	BB	990.411438	4914.847168SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.016631	BB	348.938232	1891.040405SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.004124	AA	1147.003540	398.107513SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.006343	AA	2758.980957	424.214844SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.002748	AB	803.547546	696.147827SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.008158	AA	1939.361206	498.874603SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.001200	AB	1032.029541	1013.186279SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.000935	AB	1499.531494	1248.032349SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.004171	AB	1678.968018	2034.843384SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.001706	BB	559.760681	2579.740234SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.006070	AA	1365.613037	221.331284SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.021034	AB	916.784546	1849.314209SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.009144	AA	742.414917	316.322113SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.001544	AA	2124.819336	1028.816284SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.008997	AB	3204.677490	3072.188232SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.001565	AA	1350.352051	316.322113SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.004464	AA	3651.671631	790.561951SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.002449	AA	2103.364746	332.584625!sample_table_end
