CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690428/suppl/GSM1690428_20100331_MART_MM_SNP61_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690428/suppl/GSM1690428_20100331_MART_MM_SNP61_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.011902	BB	757.142212	1857.833496SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.761143	AB	813.110718	422.566864SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.003890	BB	1106.505371	3648.229980SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.054324	AB	862.062500	1212.486938SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.004712	AA	1057.589844	379.564087SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.003572	AA	1845.007446	331.603058SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.074148	BB	578.899719	1143.845581SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.006610	AA	993.448425	394.039001SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.002513	AA	1150.897949	327.255371SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.024110	BB	673.698181	1201.438843SNP_A-1995893	NC	0.177087	AB	791.268738	1821.081299SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.002161	BB	614.971985	3123.126221SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.006305	AA	929.280212	268.760376SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.002479	AA	1510.328125	408.988159SNP_A-1997922	NC	0.564586	AB	650.593384	881.596619SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.004003	AA	1911.716919	873.238892SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.009777	AA	2513.258789	661.515442SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.006266	AA	1111.383423	276.196930SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.000759	AA	3573.747803	921.720886SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.001872	AA	1713.341675	377.357483!sample_table_end
