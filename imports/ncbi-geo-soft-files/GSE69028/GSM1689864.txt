CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689864/suppl/GSM1689864_20110905_MART_MM_SNP106__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689864/suppl/GSM1689864_20110905_MART_MM_SNP106__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.002755	AB	1433.576416	1283.250000SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.002344	BB	272.694122	651.035583SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004846	BB	1165.322510	4769.420410SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.005526	BB	391.178833	1229.317505SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.001523	AA	1208.042114	361.381348SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.001479	AA	2189.231934	336.750641SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.002368	AB	840.743835	683.749634SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.004649	AA	2061.265381	607.231995SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.004051	AA	1367.610352	487.339508SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.002010	BB	652.575562	2198.314453SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.008600	BB	389.604919	2763.011719SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.003943	BB	504.131165	2624.281250SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.002625	AA	1239.994019	299.100159SNP_A-1997896	BB	0.009292	BB	545.675232	2107.069824SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.018783	AA	736.919128	336.505646SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.003710	AA	1894.659302	991.045654SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.003218	AB	2743.090088	3005.962402SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.006542	AA	1170.556396	339.621460SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.002617	AA	3481.163086	1013.350220SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.001307	AA	1745.522095	269.623779!sample_table_end
