CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689873/suppl/GSM1689873_20110920_MART_MM_SNP115__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689873/suppl/GSM1689873_20110920_MART_MM_SNP115__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.002233	BB	485.160950	2423.375488SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.000330	BB	294.435394	784.278687SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001028	BB	1269.074585	4144.102051SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.004253	BB	598.274536	1795.292969SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.002864	AA	1263.671143	299.288544SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.002050	AB	1231.165771	1073.102905SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.005153	AB	784.244263	621.848755SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.036176	AA	2710.451660	942.520813SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.013440	AA	2121.128662	416.339783SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.008720	AB	1520.327881	1679.485840SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.004748	AB	1798.720581	1867.878540SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.004964	BB	566.815369	2246.560303SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.028433	AA	2337.670898	290.276978SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.003242	AB	990.551331	1439.190674SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.012988	AA	761.815552	337.089081SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.001170	AA	2512.206543	1064.348633SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.007622	AA	4135.459473	885.052002SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.033488	AA	1296.047974	469.446716SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.002141	AA	3180.824951	932.816284SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.003011	AA	1571.018066	282.036926!sample_table_end
