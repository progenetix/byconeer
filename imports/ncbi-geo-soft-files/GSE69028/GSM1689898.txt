CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689898/suppl/GSM1689898_20111121_MART_MM_SNP141_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689898/suppl/GSM1689898_20111121_MART_MM_SNP141_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.002203	BB	490.322174	1931.136108SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.008775	BB	213.784714	501.585388SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.013365	BB	1074.458984	5134.407715SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.000900	AB	1518.316895	1055.896973SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.005308	AA	1063.850586	291.547668SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.001419	AB	1519.192383	1080.529297SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.013599	BB	449.434692	1589.519409SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.003995	AA	1350.508911	395.190155SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.003533	AB	1157.741699	1122.339966SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.006971	AA	2456.173340	627.205444SNP_A-1995893	AA	0.002296	AA	2121.777100	940.041809SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.006286	BB	455.457367	2230.475830SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.006452	AA	1576.760132	237.624908SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.005278	AA	1938.161743	534.911133SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.007371	AA	654.205933	216.657715SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.002672	AA	2291.791504	896.567322SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.002548	AB	2737.208496	2948.371582SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.001975	AA	1352.008301	323.617828SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.003842	AA	3168.698486	760.324036SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.000533	AA	1815.223755	340.743866!sample_table_end
