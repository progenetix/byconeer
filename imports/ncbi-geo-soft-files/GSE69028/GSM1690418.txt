CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690418/suppl/GSM1690418_20111212_MART_MM_SNP161_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690418/suppl/GSM1690418_20111212_MART_MM_SNP161_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.001383	BB	529.704590	2449.370605SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.005321	BB	251.679428	876.505981SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001925	BB	1184.143311	4481.815918SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.001953	BB	456.680969	1640.065918SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.005943	AA	1279.410889	436.435944SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.005032	AB	1589.273560	1267.576050SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.001424	AB	841.612610	757.623474SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.003667	AA	1989.046509	625.222290SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.001634	AB	987.163757	1026.867310SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.005096	AB	1540.501587	1571.054321SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.002180	AB	1326.828857	1713.906006SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.002079	BB	549.429321	2746.685791SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.022508	AA	1785.575928	196.994629SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.001932	AA	1488.333618	432.183441SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.004720	AB	585.877747	513.924011SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.008544	AA	3159.818604	1210.811523SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.006954	AA	4016.369629	818.104675SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.003577	AA	1425.611816	349.085419SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.005662	AA	4114.127441	980.581299SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.004625	AA	2145.019287	251.679428!sample_table_end
