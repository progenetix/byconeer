CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689858/suppl/GSM1689858_20100331_MART_MM_SNP65__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689858/suppl/GSM1689858_20100331_MART_MM_SNP65__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.003308	AB	1622.394531	1864.676880SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.000476	BB	283.217712	741.132080SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001829	BB	1205.037964	4511.875977SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.004232	BB	570.259338	1858.298828SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.003080	AA	1174.068604	304.799316SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.002168	AB	1574.579590	1176.180664SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.002932	BB	330.794983	1390.469604SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.003165	AA	1227.097290	412.118927SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.000725	AB	938.587585	970.121277SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.002313	AA	2069.303223	347.311188SNP_A-1995893	AA	0.001858	AA	2163.640381	954.951172SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.002233	BB	556.315552	2835.048584SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.003173	AA	1647.946045	286.199493SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.002122	AA	1463.173828	434.022125SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.003104	AA	1015.878357	277.247711SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.007425	AA	2816.969971	919.386475SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.001241	AB	2636.056152	2607.176514SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.008150	AA	1591.707520	226.784729SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.003692	AA	3834.763428	870.431946SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.002913	AB	1400.556030	1171.579834!sample_table_end
