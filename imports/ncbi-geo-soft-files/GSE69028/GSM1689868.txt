CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689868/suppl/GSM1689868_20110905_MART_MM_SNP110__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689868/suppl/GSM1689868_20110905_MART_MM_SNP110__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.008054	BB	375.195679	1416.692749SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.004464	BB	269.301514	584.085022SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004679	BB	1371.800659	3941.451660SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.003064	BB	421.797943	1352.485229SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.002832	AA	1163.449097	311.811798SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.009775	AB	1047.063232	852.810669SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.006244	AB	758.475891	607.013245SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.002994	AA	1248.254517	446.658752SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.008648	AB	696.983459	610.609802SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.003903	AB	1429.480713	1459.883911SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.010060	AB	1343.536865	1334.219482SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.005588	BB	502.665588	2134.912109SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.001072	AA	1302.645386	263.792084SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.003108	AB	1241.164185	1734.147705SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.045458	AA	547.976868	280.392639SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.007230	AA	1651.505249	987.268250SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.002308	AB	2501.923340	2450.439941SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.003595	AA	1647.814453	299.047913SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.013588	AA	2559.624023	619.019897SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.007671	AA	1460.143555	327.238037!sample_table_end
