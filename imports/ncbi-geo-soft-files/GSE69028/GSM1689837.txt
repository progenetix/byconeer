CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689837/suppl/GSM1689837_20090604_MM19_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689837/suppl/GSM1689837_20090604_MM19_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.000755	BB	568.389709	2429.489746SNP_A-1967418	NC	0.823573	BB	492.417206	764.855652SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.007606	BB	1578.820435	5082.335938SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.000461	AB	1449.783447	1062.002075SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.007927	AA	1482.706787	259.989807SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.007793	AA	2513.818604	475.851044SNP_A-1980898	AA	0.003511	AA	1458.299805	351.824219SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.002413	AA	1581.419312	462.068817SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.002005	AA	1612.685669	421.529968SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.002420	AA	2052.411621	336.050201SNP_A-1995893	AA	0.008978	AA	2873.486816	1211.980957SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.001117	BB	610.815552	2700.250000SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.006597	AA	1449.783447	345.352692SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.001910	AA	1691.397461	553.530640SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.002889	AA	771.381775	240.300171SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.003296	AA	2557.186523	950.393799SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.001600	AB	2489.265869	2509.274170SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.003719	AA	1595.624023	269.861877SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.002622	AA	3786.725586	900.940857SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.017578	AA	2910.835205	574.169861!sample_table_end
