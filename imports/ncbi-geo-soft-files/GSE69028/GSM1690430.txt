CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690430/suppl/GSM1690430_20090520_MM14_SNP6.0_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690430/suppl/GSM1690430_20090520_MM14_SNP6.0_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.005826	BB	725.149292	2083.931396SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.007573	BB	221.039886	522.619507SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.000190	BB	1229.172363	4287.819824SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.006215	BB	475.557831	1195.452026SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.007613	AA	1671.660522	419.994995SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.006029	AA	1680.504639	319.889221SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.020691	BB	226.307312	664.641113SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.010161	AA	860.086670	387.341858SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.006192	AA	778.406128	304.759338SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.003733	BB	597.330383	1654.200439SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.017294	BB	615.833435	3318.338867SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.022184	BB	867.250610	4427.574707SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.002667	AA	1284.879150	244.447525SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.003725	AB	957.855896	1504.122437SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.055720	BB	409.741699	746.236694SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.015175	AB	1114.655396	2076.187744SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.003798	BB	1453.844360	3271.956543SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.001558	AA	1342.810181	280.228729SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.004935	AA	2982.613281	746.236694SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.005594	AB	776.412964	713.079102!sample_table_end
