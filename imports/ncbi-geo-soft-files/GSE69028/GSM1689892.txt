CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689892/suppl/GSM1689892_20110920_MART_MM_SNP126_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689892/suppl/GSM1689892_20110920_MART_MM_SNP126_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.006960	AB	1157.245117	1040.018677SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.000686	BB	286.177612	725.255798SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.005631	BB	926.656982	3846.990723SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.002369	AB	1426.977539	1162.027466SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.002853	AA	1302.790771	402.335266SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.000451	AA	2175.715820	372.543854SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.005241	BB	329.319611	1014.530579SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.001545	AA	1381.921021	457.514282SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.005121	AB	652.426025	691.986511SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.004144	AB	1227.567505	1050.244385SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.004056	AB	1265.845825	1543.144409SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.000883	BB	623.353699	3008.852539SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.000137	AA	1379.100220	278.365356SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.002183	AB	1024.058105	1536.293823SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.002285	AA	996.308350	290.068970SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.001108	AB	1463.548462	1862.492920SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.003958	AB	2183.774902	2450.438965SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.004912	AA	1186.015381	322.238312SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.007418	AA	3315.931152	684.505005SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.001892	AB	986.960693	885.215576!sample_table_end
