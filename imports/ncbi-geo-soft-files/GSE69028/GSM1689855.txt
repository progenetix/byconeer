CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689855/suppl/GSM1689855_20100205_MART_MM_SNP39__GenomeWideSNP_6__2.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689855/suppl/GSM1689855_20100205_MART_MM_SNP39__GenomeWideSNP_6__2.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AB	0.004740	AB	1860.896484	1940.450562SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.007709	BB	260.036713	950.326904SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.002820	BB	1125.828003	3780.635254SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.002897	BB	502.084564	1372.007812SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.004771	AA	1594.628784	396.858032SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.002065	AB	1575.516968	1169.804688SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.006721	AB	1040.209106	694.206055SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.002510	AA	1507.396973	541.337769SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.002129	AA	1139.965332	395.933258SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.004301	AB	1471.580933	1019.310486SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.002853	AB	1703.268799	1924.655884SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.003878	BB	713.281677	3413.470947SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.010694	AA	1154.478149	190.084259SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.002816	AB	1311.809570	1563.164917SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.004071	AA	1046.494019	278.350342SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.006233	AA	2206.274414	1328.917114SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.012432	AA	3051.084229	1244.735718SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.004851	AA	1561.872437	357.000732SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.004209	AA	3893.308105	1040.739624SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.002676	AA	2148.721924	357.000732!sample_table_end
