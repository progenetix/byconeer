CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689852/suppl/GSM1689852_20100108_MART_MM_SNP49__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689852/suppl/GSM1689852_20100108_MART_MM_SNP49__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.004205	BB	629.166565	2892.568604SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.002353	BB	328.224426	864.089844SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004377	BB	1078.104248	4511.090332SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.010457	AB	1211.252319	756.314758SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.005005	AA	1006.970459	352.060028SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.004659	AB	1758.158325	1171.371216SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.001608	AB	837.740784	722.958252SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.007935	AA	2033.457275	534.640930SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.002664	AA	1142.358032	411.499542SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.001162	AB	1391.421631	1266.767822SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.001856	AB	1496.318848	1893.761108SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.001666	BB	660.788452	3154.640625SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.007141	AA	946.011658	287.504517SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.008736	AA	1946.908447	389.033997SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.073737	AB	674.067017	839.463318SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.002485	AA	2037.930054	1056.136719SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.003474	AA	3132.626709	1000.701416SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.000987	AA	1431.377197	282.441650SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.010964	AA	3603.023438	663.699097SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.002178	AA	1790.893555	208.845825!sample_table_end
