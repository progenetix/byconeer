CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689857/suppl/GSM1689857_20100331_MART_MM_SNP62__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689857/suppl/GSM1689857_20100331_MART_MM_SNP62__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.000236	BB	564.488403	2334.673584SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.002086	BB	293.311432	859.168213SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004563	BB	1459.145264	4908.357910SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.004213	AB	1264.996582	1028.909058SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.003375	AA	1128.159790	309.668640SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.005865	AB	1778.195190	1241.031494SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.007548	BB	265.265442	1440.491821SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.001898	AA	1472.090820	519.784729SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.007498	AA	791.371704	349.733368SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.003190	AB	1277.504761	1038.683960SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.014542	AB	1220.243774	2057.831299SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.008010	BB	510.757446	3053.135010SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.006679	AA	967.238464	223.486664SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.003359	AA	1522.932739	384.464355SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.007293	AB	856.289673	617.147278SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.003442	AA	1973.595581	884.218262SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.001893	AB	2460.376709	2481.642090SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.003618	AA	1478.889160	252.401749SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.000466	AA	3477.615234	931.584656SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.001017	AA	1789.332642	284.343658!sample_table_end
