CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689850/suppl/GSM1689850_20090728_MART_MM_SNP32__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689850/suppl/GSM1689850_20090728_MART_MM_SNP32__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.002392	BB	675.848450	2409.262451SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.001283	BB	270.064911	771.034302SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.006366	BB	1037.188232	3406.218506SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.004014	BB	425.091125	1279.816650SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.005459	AA	1053.719238	392.030457SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.013803	AB	1020.843140	793.640503SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.002139	AB	834.975037	790.726135SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.002136	AA	1425.869385	508.637970SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.006256	AB	558.582397	672.610535SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.003998	AA	1870.067871	412.425323SNP_A-1995893	AA	0.006737	AA	1828.610840	935.506775SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.005291	BB	726.135925	2922.489990SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.003765	AA	1146.308594	236.658356SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.005164	AA	1302.170410	526.954163SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.001908	AA	893.377136	243.954315SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.004246	AA	1877.491699	1042.249878SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.008964	AA	2544.975098	722.206482SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.001033	AA	1456.908325	317.287994SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.003771	AA	3090.261963	965.955505SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.054512	AA	1242.181396	302.484955!sample_table_end
