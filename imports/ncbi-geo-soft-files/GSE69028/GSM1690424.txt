CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690424/suppl/GSM1690424_20111212_MART_MM_SNP153_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690424/suppl/GSM1690424_20111212_MART_MM_SNP153_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.009651	BB	506.078064	1321.596558SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.004581	BB	264.330261	579.514160SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.025727	BB	962.837219	2628.051514SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.006436	BB	439.971680	1165.096191SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.010914	AA	809.653870	318.499420SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.012292	AA	1393.907593	312.695465SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.010747	BB	302.223022	849.906128SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.006840	AA	971.528564	383.091187SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.011187	AB	397.934570	799.928528SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.007995	BB	459.891632	1303.483398SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.011205	BB	425.514526	1740.269531SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.009376	BB	516.982971	1895.753540SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.012291	AA	864.535645	308.444824SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.016841	AA	936.123291	439.971680SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.021088	BB	341.969452	726.299500SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.016857	AA	1294.708984	931.980591SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.009566	BB	1004.422852	2447.767822SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.005044	AA	1174.769653	265.623535SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.026088	AA	1912.629028	645.840759SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.496734	AB	879.159485	243.107025!sample_table_end
