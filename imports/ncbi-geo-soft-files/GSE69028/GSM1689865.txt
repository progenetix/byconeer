CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689865/suppl/GSM1689865_20110905_MART_MM_SNP107__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689865/suppl/GSM1689865_20110905_MART_MM_SNP107__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.002269	BB	462.960510	2304.783691SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.008633	BB	290.757080	529.324707SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.003939	BB	1339.691650	3931.784668SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.007162	AB	1167.903809	970.250916SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.005416	AA	1251.425903	268.678741SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.003333	AA	2130.717041	307.291046SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.002102	BB	318.037964	1112.932495SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.011199	AA	1774.456543	424.295441SNP_A-4265735	BB	0.001909	BB	413.284332	1356.462769SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.000082	BB	585.760132	1964.965454SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.001374	BB	443.064819	2294.527832SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.003159	BB	622.263123	2539.518799SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.002265	AA	1196.834229	286.510803SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.001982	AB	1033.250244	1519.756592SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.010594	AB	518.413879	451.835907SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.000738	AA	2463.028809	1070.177002SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.002040	AA	3558.605957	808.843689SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.002347	AA	1489.581787	334.576172SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.004353	AA	2876.392822	860.398010SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.013142	AA	1376.117554	302.083801!sample_table_end
