CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689833/suppl/GSM1689833_20090604_MM15_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689833/suppl/GSM1689833_20090604_MM15_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.002002	BB	660.730286	2463.070068SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.005712	AB	745.088257	670.528503SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.006952	BB	1508.238892	5145.063477SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.002250	AB	1420.850098	1152.619385SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.004003	AA	1590.447876	346.874878SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.003908	AA	2454.542969	434.676544SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.003012	BB	339.313904	1394.204468SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.005894	AA	1532.814087	591.051147SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.005578	AB	1152.416626	1188.846069SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.004790	AA	2183.566650	315.097626SNP_A-1995893	AA	0.006162	AA	2755.705811	1233.353882SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.007039	BB	781.682068	3268.613770SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.003793	AA	1699.058594	300.043488SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.008121	AA	2027.126953	472.702393SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.003233	AA	751.196655	252.258316SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.010468	AA	3256.847900	1218.611938SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.001484	AB	2609.992432	2861.933838SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.008223	AA	1635.113525	232.877136SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.003414	AA	3737.016113	843.655090SNP_A-4268173	BB	0.033510	BB	274.785309	3206.099854!sample_table_end
