CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689835/suppl/GSM1689835_20090604_MM17_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689835/suppl/GSM1689835_20090604_MM17_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.001152	BB	614.692505	2260.576172SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.006884	BB	383.237854	914.373596SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.021775	BB	1850.405029	5659.351074SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.004218	AB	1372.594116	891.234070SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.011331	AA	1779.506226	302.957092SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.009354	AA	2749.151611	333.415833SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.015100	AB	1010.053589	1063.241211SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.012080	AA	1984.460938	481.183441SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.001764	AA	1130.223511	363.940674SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.002270	AB	1337.312988	1062.726685SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.003988	AB	1659.725952	2028.279785SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.005363	BB	641.237915	3452.125000SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.002042	AA	1361.957642	253.160278SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.004913	AB	1356.667969	1736.087036SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.002319	AA	890.139099	236.566895SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.002611	AA	2260.912842	1205.840942SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.001100	AB	2569.740479	2576.443359SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.002187	AA	1535.320801	326.707520SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.004673	AA	3686.199219	793.052124SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.001538	AB	1242.266479	1203.643188!sample_table_end
