CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690412/suppl/GSM1690412_20111121_MART_MM_SNP146_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690412/suppl/GSM1690412_20111121_MART_MM_SNP146_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.001765	BB	502.896576	2418.765869SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.011020	AB	637.290466	449.054443SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.003835	BB	1337.365479	4881.127930SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.002481	BB	566.477173	1608.542236SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.002875	AA	1131.531616	321.155182SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.004127	AA	1829.362549	364.588531SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.007068	AB	694.202271	687.069275SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.009233	AA	981.643005	293.105713SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.003050	AB	1130.532715	1103.279053SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.001291	BB	579.346069	2089.497314SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.001878	BB	415.906769	2302.196045SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.006969	BB	517.636536	2034.310669SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.000463	AA	1349.036499	284.917938SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.021382	AB	925.919189	949.263855SNP_A-1997922	AB	0.004194	AB	643.899780	516.580322SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.002310	AA	2486.247314	969.348145SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.007527	AA	4096.488770	853.659607SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.014047	AA	1878.221069	254.610977SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.003895	AA	3595.950928	793.760803SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.004939	AA	2197.696045	273.929077!sample_table_end
