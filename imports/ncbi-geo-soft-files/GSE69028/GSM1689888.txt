CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689888/suppl/GSM1689888_20110920_MART_MM_SNP122_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689888/suppl/GSM1689888_20110920_MART_MM_SNP122_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.003057	BB	431.129639	1945.729248SNP_A-1967418	AB	0.024818	AB	683.200256	449.591461SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.003263	BB	1431.295044	4343.069824SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.004666	BB	611.999146	1760.321777SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.002098	AA	1440.563965	326.522675SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.002293	AA	2024.268188	383.282013SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.009600	AB	1150.926636	823.735962SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.001396	AA	1626.916382	552.173767SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.004213	AA	926.568115	354.068115SNP_A-1995832	AB	0.001743	AB	1333.360352	1139.091553SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.002571	AB	1421.011475	1596.672729SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.002030	BB	685.177734	3128.250977SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.003807	AA	1620.015625	322.607910SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.005639	AB	1397.180054	1713.160522SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.004127	AA	1005.395752	246.867249SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.000273	AA	2349.303467	1092.697388SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.003378	AA	2965.359131	794.030212SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.000690	AA	1391.938110	289.198761SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.001222	AA	3566.954102	964.203308SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.002232	AB	965.175964	853.260132!sample_table_end
