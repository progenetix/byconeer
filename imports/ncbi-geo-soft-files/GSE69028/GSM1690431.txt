CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690431/suppl/GSM1690431_20090121_MM03_SNP6.0_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1690nnn/GSM1690431/suppl/GSM1690431_20090121_MM03_SNP6.0_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.001689	BB	587.679382	2584.252930SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.002096	BB	306.716034	868.829651SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.002297	BB	1139.887939	4420.288086SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.004951	BB	390.624329	1268.540527SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.005587	AA	1138.564575	415.647247SNP_A-4264431	BB	0.001905	BB	524.726807	1915.495483SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.001082	BB	336.877258	1264.656616SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.003550	AA	1787.833496	503.900269SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.002066	AB	774.088257	816.071167SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.005692	BB	436.714172	1785.149658SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.000701	BB	541.369507	2493.897705SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.005559	BB	490.646362	2151.609863SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.001770	AA	1215.229736	259.622559SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.002967	AA	1824.981934	502.525116SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.014960	BB	402.982605	1232.214111SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.001949	AA	2193.249512	930.572693SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.002800	AB	2434.870850	2404.977295SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.002899	AA	1248.085571	306.716034SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.005683	AA	3543.424316	742.839722SNP_A-4268173	AB	0.002855	AB	1355.583984	1033.082764!sample_table_end
