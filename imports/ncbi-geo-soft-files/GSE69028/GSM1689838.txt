CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689838/suppl/GSM1689838_20090604_MM21_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689838/suppl/GSM1689838_20090604_MM21_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.008318	AA	2310.801514	826.182861SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.002091	BB	326.292938	757.822266SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.006812	BB	1021.492188	3370.552246SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.007120	BB	417.415680	1136.752441SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.004201	AA	1587.253174	385.314423SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.000321	AA	2259.696777	372.500336SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.003131	BB	339.051056	1399.473755SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.005465	AA	1055.473511	365.698486SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.594125	AB	410.501434	1003.975830SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.005612	BB	546.277405	1462.367188SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.002402	BB	495.119659	2205.105957SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.026916	BB	877.026978	2928.765625SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.004535	AA	1025.021240	274.926910SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.010725	AA	1077.644531	436.497437SNP_A-1997922	NC	0.125733	BB	592.110352	893.100342SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.018151	AA	2317.195557	1605.776855SNP_A-2000332	BB	0.010449	BB	1040.989746	2418.421143SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.007103	AA	1395.653931	377.125580SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.009373	AA	3118.220947	1098.517456SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.005850	AA	1532.512451	368.951447!sample_table_end
