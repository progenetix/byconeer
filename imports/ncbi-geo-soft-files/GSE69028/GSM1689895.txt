CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689895/suppl/GSM1689895_20110920_MART_MM_SNP130_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689895/suppl/GSM1689895_20110920_MART_MM_SNP130_GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_series_id = GSE69028!Sample_series_id = GSE69029!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.009399	BB	486.620087	1314.378662SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.004790	BB	256.246338	573.484558SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001788	BB	1323.183228	4606.153320SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.008863	BB	674.034241	1810.870605SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.004314	AA	1597.711548	339.696381SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.004138	AA	2213.406494	432.599121SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.006773	BB	303.804901	938.761230SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.006484	AA	1072.355957	335.504456SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.025176	AA	647.547058	364.126312SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.008518	BB	542.498352	1321.868286SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.010823	BB	538.309998	1881.035400SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.002820	BB	577.743652	3029.343018SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.001750	AA	1284.216675	254.747498SNP_A-1997896	BB	0.014958	BB	846.331482	3302.435791SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.008726	AA	1146.930420	272.656799SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.010431	AA	2305.397217	1468.414795SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.005512	AA	2776.322021	757.951172SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.004719	AA	1547.075439	357.038330SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.001201	AA	3484.970703	860.046326SNP_A-4268173	NC	0.611774	AA	1045.879761	315.327209!sample_table_end
