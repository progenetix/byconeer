After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48Â¡C, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber.!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol , dried for 1 hour and scanned on a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA from ccRCC tumor and reference DNA from blood sample of the corresponding ccRCC patient were genotyped using Infinium HumanHap300 Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_data_processing = Genomic DNA extracted from ccRCC tumor and normal blood DNA pairs was genotyped using Infinium HumanHap300 Genotyping BeadChips (Illumina).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6979!Sample_contact_name = Xifeng,,Wu!Sample_contact_email = xwu@mdanderson.org!Sample_contact_phone = 7137452485!Sample_contact_fax = 7137924657!Sample_contact_department = Epidemiology!Sample_contact_institute = UT M.D Anderson Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 1155 pressler blvd.!Sample_contact_city = Houston!Sample_contact_state = TX!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 77030!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE16019!Sample_data_row_count = 317497#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log_R_Ratio#sample42.AlleleFreq Ref. = #sample42.AlleleFreq Sub. = #sample42.|dAlleleFreq sub-ref| = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	sample42.AlleleFreq Ref.	sample42.AlleleFreq Sub.	sample42.|dAlleleFreq sub-ref|rs3934834-124_T_R_1135975865	0.09702389	1	1	rs3737728-124_T_R_1135790679	-0.09643885	0.9872769	1	rs6687776-124_T_R_1135347468	0.1641696	0.9974107	1	rs9651273-124_T_F_1136827223	-0.1884216	0.5514219	0.5485603	0.002861619rs4970405-124_T_F_1136522326	-0.2043881	0.001301783	0.002565725	rs12726255-124_B_R_1135572792	-0.1257062	0.008271239	9.51E-05	rs2298217-124_T_R_1135807872	0.1121191	0.9881136	1	rs4970357-124_T_F_1135327694	-1.012534	0	0.0267507	rs4970362-124_T_F_1135713090	-0.1742128	0.994935	1	rs9660710-124_B_R_1135732876	0.1262573	0.9958881	1	rs4970420-124_B_R_1136441302	-0.0694528	0.9944199	1	rs1320565-124_B_F_1137428853	-0.1205777	0.9834105	0.9981231	rs11260549-124_B_R_1135739417	0.04965375	0.9676291	0.965169	rs9729550-124_B_R_1135710069	0.1321373	0.004427306	0	rs11721-124_T_R_1136433517	0.06624801	1	1	rs2887286-124_B_R_1135111632	0.1613302	0.000312579	0	rs3813199-124_T_R_1136807858	0.0396814	1	0.9900176	rs3766186-124_T_R_1136764966	0.03295017	1	1	rs7515488-124_B_F_1136819717	-0.06452059	0.976885	0.9969698	rs715643-124_T_R_1137448467	-0.1096625	1	1	!sample_table_end
