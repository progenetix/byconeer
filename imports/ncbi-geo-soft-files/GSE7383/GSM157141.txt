Probe was blocked using 100ug human CoT-1 DNA and hybridized to the slide at 45C for ~36 hours under a 24x60mm coverslip in a hybrization cassette. Wash: 4X 0.1% SDS/0.1X SSC at 45C. Rinse: 4X 0.1X SSC, room temp. Dried with an oil-free air stream.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned at 10um resolution on a Applied Precision Instruments AutoE CCD-based scanner.!Sample_description = tumor DNA (cy3) hybridized against normal male pooled reference DNA (cy5)!Sample_data_processing = Data was obtained from the scanned image files generated using SoftWoRx Tracker software from Applied Precision. Obtained data was normalized using a three-step normalization procedure; (Khojasteh et al BMC Bioinformatics 2005;6:274). !Sample_platform_id = GPL2735!Sample_contact_name = Lindsey,,Kimm!Sample_contact_email = lkimm@bccrc.ca!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wan Lam Lab!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = BC Cancer Research Centre!Sample_contact_address = 675 W10th Ave!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_state = British Columbia!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V5Z 1L3!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE7383!Sample_data_row_count = 98208
