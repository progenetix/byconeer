After removing necrotic tissue and washing three times in ice-cold PBS, tumor specimens were divided under aseptic sterile conditions using a No.10 scalpel blade to yield 2 Ã 1 Ã 1 mm3 pieces. The tissue fragments were then incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 U/mL streptomycin (condition 1), or in DMEM medium supplemented with 50% Matrigelâ¢ (BD; 356234), 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (Gibco; PHG0314), 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Gibco; PHG0264), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 U/mL streptomycin (condition 2) for 30 min. After sterilizing the dorsal shaved area(s) with BetadineÂ® surgical scrub, followed by 70% ethanol, three or four pieces of tissue were transplanted subcutaneously into the right flanks of NOD/SCID mice (n = 3) with a No.2 trocar.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = DNA from each sample was digested using the NspI (Cat#R0602L, New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, US) and StyI (Cat#R0500L, New England BioLabs) restriction enzymes, and two adaptors were ligated to the DNA fragment for PCR amplification. To obtain biotin-labeled DNA, amplified DNA was labeled using the AffymetrixÂ® Genome-Wide Human SNP Nsp/Sty Assay Kit 6.0 (Cat#901015, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, US) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Affymetrix protocol!Sample_hyb_protocol = Affymetrix protocol!Sample_scan_protocol = Affymetrix protocol!Sample_description = genotyping data from PDX59 F2!Sample_data_processing = The CEL files wrere read by R function crlmm.
