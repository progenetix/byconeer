Aberrant DNA copy number intervals identified using the Aberration Detection Method 2 (ADM-2), default threshold setting 6.0, and Fuzzy Zero correction algorithm applied. To ensure the exclusion of very low or very small aberrations, we added a custom-made aberration filter defining a region with a copy number aberration as a region with minimum five probes gained/lost and with minimum absolute average log2 ratio of 0.2 (gain) or -0.2 (loss). A loss defined as homozygous when the log2 ratio was lower than -1, and a gain was regarded as high level amplification when the log2 ratio was higher than 1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL10123!Sample_contact_name = Hanne-Sofie,S,Dahlback!Sample_contact_email = h.s.s.dahlback@medisin.uio.no!Sample_contact_department = Section for Cancer Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_institute = The Norwegian Radium Hospital!Sample_contact_address = Montebello!Sample_contact_city = Oslo!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 0310!Sample_contact_country = Norway!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM685nnn/GSM685391/suppl/GSM685391.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27671!Sample_data_row_count = 180880#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy3/Cy5 (test/reference)#INV_VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	INV_VALUE1	-0.0615602	6.156018368e-0022	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+0003	-0.258402	2.584017027e-0014	-0.195054	1.950542306e-0015	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+0006	-0.197293	1.972926946e-0017	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+0008	-0.139088	1.390877996e-0019	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00010	-0.332657	3.326567703e-00111	-0.0869514	8.695140500e-00212	-0.306801	3.068008412e-00113	-0.266208	2.662082315e-00114	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00015	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00016	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00017	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00018	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00019	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00020	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+000!sample_table_end
