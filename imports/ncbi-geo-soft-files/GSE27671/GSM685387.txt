Aberrant DNA copy number intervals identified using the Aberration Detection Method 2 (ADM-2), default threshold setting 6.0, and Fuzzy Zero correction algorithm applied. To ensure the exclusion of very low or very small aberrations, we added a custom-made aberration filter defining a region with a copy number aberration as a region with minimum five probes gained/lost and with minimum absolute average log2 ratio of 0.2 (gain) or -0.2 (loss). A loss defined as homozygous when the log2 ratio was lower than -1, and a gain was regarded as high level amplification when the log2 ratio was higher than 1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL10123!Sample_contact_name = Hanne-Sofie,S,Dahlback!Sample_contact_email = h.s.s.dahlback@medisin.uio.no!Sample_contact_department = Section for Cancer Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_institute = The Norwegian Radium Hospital!Sample_contact_address = Montebello!Sample_contact_city = Oslo!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 0310!Sample_contact_country = Norway!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM685nnn/GSM685387/suppl/GSM685387.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27671!Sample_data_row_count = 180880#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy3/Cy5 (test/reference)#INV_VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	INV_VALUE1	-0.111987	1.119865361e-0012	0.26501	-2.650101035e-0013	0.175931	-1.759313727e-0014	0.151882	-1.518822284e-0015	0.00347089	-3.470886865e-0036	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+0007	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+0008	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+0009	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00010	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00011	-0.0189992	1.899915524e-00212	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00013	-0.0469146	4.691458043e-00214	-0.205836	2.058364987e-00115	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00016	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00017	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00018	-0.0895659	8.956592034e-00219	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00020	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+000!sample_table_end
