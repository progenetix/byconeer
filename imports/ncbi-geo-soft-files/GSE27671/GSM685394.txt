Aberrant DNA copy number intervals identified using the Aberration Detection Method 2 (ADM-2), default threshold setting 6.0, and Fuzzy Zero correction algorithm applied. To ensure the exclusion of very low or very small aberrations, we added a custom-made aberration filter defining a region with a copy number aberration as a region with minimum five probes gained/lost and with minimum absolute average log2 ratio of 0.2 (gain) or -0.2 (loss). A loss defined as homozygous when the log2 ratio was lower than -1, and a gain was regarded as high level amplification when the log2 ratio was higher than 1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL10123!Sample_contact_name = Hanne-Sofie,S,Dahlback!Sample_contact_email = h.s.s.dahlback@medisin.uio.no!Sample_contact_department = Section for Cancer Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_institute = The Norwegian Radium Hospital!Sample_contact_address = Montebello!Sample_contact_city = Oslo!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 0310!Sample_contact_country = Norway!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM685nnn/GSM685394/suppl/GSM685394.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27671!Sample_data_row_count = 180880#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy3/Cy5 (test/reference)#INV_VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	INV_VALUE1	0.0155111	-1.551105573e-0022	0.311161	-3.111605474e-0013	0.205565	-2.055648576e-0014	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+0005	0.0247537	-2.475372303e-0026	0.302928	-3.029275059e-0017	0.371397	-3.713973679e-0018	-0.266447	2.664468970e-0019	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00010	0.234748	-2.347475050e-00111	0.188245	-1.882454827e-00112	0.160788	-1.607880148e-00113	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00014	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00015	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00016	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00017	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00018	0.400496	-4.004961742e-00119	0.227384	-2.273842817e-00120	0.391534	-3.915336676e-001!sample_table_end
