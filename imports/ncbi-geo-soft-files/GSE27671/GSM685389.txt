Aberrant DNA copy number intervals identified using the Aberration Detection Method 2 (ADM-2), default threshold setting 6.0, and Fuzzy Zero correction algorithm applied. To ensure the exclusion of very low or very small aberrations, we added a custom-made aberration filter defining a region with a copy number aberration as a region with minimum five probes gained/lost and with minimum absolute average log2 ratio of 0.2 (gain) or -0.2 (loss). A loss defined as homozygous when the log2 ratio was lower than -1, and a gain was regarded as high level amplification when the log2 ratio was higher than 1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL10123!Sample_contact_name = Hanne-Sofie,S,Dahlback!Sample_contact_email = h.s.s.dahlback@medisin.uio.no!Sample_contact_department = Section for Cancer Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_institute = The Norwegian Radium Hospital!Sample_contact_address = Montebello!Sample_contact_city = Oslo!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 0310!Sample_contact_country = Norway!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM685nnn/GSM685389/suppl/GSM685389.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27671!Sample_data_row_count = 180880#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy3/Cy5 (test/reference)#INV_VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	INV_VALUE1	-0.078561	7.856098389e-0022	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+0004	-0.243568	2.435677677e-0015	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+0006	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+0007	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+0008	-0.0522331	5.223312065e-0029	-0.0368352	3.683517449e-00210	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00011	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00012	-0.355684	3.556843042e-00113	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00014	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00015	-0.275542	2.755420639e-00116	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00017	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00018	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00019	-0.1901	1.900997392e-00120	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+000!sample_table_end
