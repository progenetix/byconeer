Aberrant DNA copy number intervals identified using the Aberration Detection Method 2 (ADM-2), default threshold setting 6.0, and Fuzzy Zero correction algorithm applied. To ensure the exclusion of very low or very small aberrations, we added a custom-made aberration filter defining a region with a copy number aberration as a region with minimum five probes gained/lost and with minimum absolute average log2 ratio of 0.2 (gain) or -0.2 (loss). A loss defined as homozygous when the log2 ratio was lower than -1, and a gain was regarded as high level amplification when the log2 ratio was higher than 1.!Sample_platform_id = GPL10123!Sample_contact_name = Hanne-Sofie,S,Dahlback!Sample_contact_email = h.s.s.dahlback@medisin.uio.no!Sample_contact_department = Section for Cancer Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_institute = The Norwegian Radium Hospital!Sample_contact_address = Montebello!Sample_contact_city = Oslo!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 0310!Sample_contact_country = Norway!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM685nnn/GSM685393/suppl/GSM685393.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27671!Sample_data_row_count = 180880#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy3/Cy5 (test/reference)#INV_VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	INV_VALUE1	-0.0316743	3.167426371e-0022	0.684561	-6.845613313e-0013	0.588771	-5.887714675e-0014	0.566451	-5.664509247e-0015	0.0703068	-7.030678298e-0026	0.349734	-3.497344431e-0017	0.362158	-3.621583044e-0018	0.138997	-1.389972369e-0019	0.0743319	-7.433186775e-00210	0.196211	-1.962109380e-00111	-0.108957	1.089573409e-00112	0.4323	-4.322996063e-00113	0.16406	-1.640597600e-00114	0.412122	-4.121223675e-00115	-0.360729	3.607292189e-00116	0.0956747	-9.567473256e-00217	0.213965	-2.139645536e-00118	0.000000000e+000	0.000000000e+00019	0.353175	-3.531751749e-00120	0.0466131	-4.661311374e-002!sample_table_end
