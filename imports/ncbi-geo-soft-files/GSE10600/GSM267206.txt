DNA from 12 normal lymph nodes was prepared similarly and pooled for the reference sample.  The single cell comparative genomic hybridization protocol (SCOMP) was used for genome amplification!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 1.0Î¼g of amplified test and reference DNA was mixed with 21.5Î¼l ddH2O and 20Î¼l of 2.5X Random Primer/Reaction Mix Buffer (Invitrogen, www.invitrogen.com), boiled for 5 min. and 5Î¼l of âlow Câ dNTP mix with either 2.5Î¼l Cy5-dCTP (Amersham Biosciences, USA) for test or Cy3 for the reference DNA with 1Î¼l of Klenow solution, then incubated at 37Â°C for 2 hrs.  The reaction was stopped by adding EDTA, then 450Î¼l of TE pH 7.4 added and the mix loaded onto a micron-30 filter (Fisher/Millipore), spun for 8-10 min. at 10,000 rpm, inverted and spun for 1 min to recover the purified probe.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Pooled normal lymph nodes!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Microdissected sections of fresh fixed paraffin embedded tissue!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = DNA extracted  using a QIAGEN DNA Mini Kit (QUIAGEN Inc., Canada) after a 72 hr period in lysis buffer at 56Â°C.
