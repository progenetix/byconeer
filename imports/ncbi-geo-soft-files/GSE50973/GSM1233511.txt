Cells were blocked with 200 Âµg/ml normal mouse IgG for 10 minutes.  Cells were then stained with the following: anti-human kappa and lambda light chain cocktail (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), anti-CD3 APC and either anti-CD20 PerCP-Cy5.5 or anti-CD19 PerCP-Cy5.5 (all from eBioscience, San Diego, CA).  The anti-CD19 antibody was used if cells were from patients who had undergone anti-CD20 immunotherapy within three months prior to sample procurement.  Cells were washed once, and DAPI (Molecular Probes) was added to a final concentration of 100ng/ml in order to discriminate dead cells.  Flow cytometry sorting was carried out on a Becton-Dickinson FACSAria IIu sorter.  The sorting schema was as follows:  cells were selected based on forward and side light scatter, a doublet discrimination gate, and negativity for DAPI.  These cells were then first interrogated for CD3 expression.  CD3-positive cells were sorted as a normal control for each patient.  CD3-negative cells were then interrogated for CD20 (or CD19) expression. CD20 (or CD19)-positive cells were subsequently interrogated for light-chain expression.  Both kappa and lambda single-positive populations were sorted and kappa to lambda ratios computed.  Either kappa or lambda was treated as tumor depending on the kappa to lambda ratio of the respective population within the sample.!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Tumor and normal cells flow purified as above were digested overnight in 100 mM Tris pH 8.0, 50 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5% SDS and 100 Î¼g/ml of Proteinase K (Invitrogen) at 560C. DNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform and precipitated using ammonium acetate, ethanol and glycogen.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = The DNA was prepared for hybridization to Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays according to the manufacturer's recommendations.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Affymetrix Hybridization Oven 640 for 16 hrs at 50 deg C with rotation at 60 rpm. Washing and staining was done on an Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanning was done using an Affymetrix Scanner 3000 7G with autoloader.!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix CEL files for each DNA sample were analyzed using Affymetrix's Genotyping Console software for initial quality control, followed by use of the Affymetrix âBirdseedâ algorithm to determine final call rates and quality. Call rates for the entire group of samples included in this report were between 97.73% and 99.33%, with a mean call rate of 98.73%; none of the tumor DNA samples gave out-of-bounds results.   For the CLL CD3 samples employed as normals in this study, for sample call rate information, please refer to GEO accession number GSE30777.  Sample copy number heatmap displays were obtained from CEL files through use of the freely available software dChip adapted to operate in a 64-bit environment.    To generate functional and practical displays of LOH, a two-step, internally developed, Java-based software analysis system was employed. The Pre-LOH Unification Tool (PLUT) served to align all individual patient SNP calls to their respective dbSNP rs ID numbers and genomic physical positions prior to incorporation into the LOH tool version 2, an updated version of the LOH software tool able to accommodate Affy SNP 6.0 array data.  LOH analysis was only carried out using the SNP call files of the lymphoma samples.  The normal DNA derived from CLL patients were not used in any manner for LOH analysis.!Sample_data_processing = dChip SNP software (www.dchip.org), build date Feb 25, 2009, compatible with 64-bit OS, analyzed the CEL files.  CEL files were normalized using the invariant set method, followed by model-based expression index calculations, and finally inferred copy number data were generated using the software's median-smoothing algorithm.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sami,N,Malek!Sample_contact_email = smalek@med.umich.edu, pouillet@med.umich.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 734-763-1222!Sample_contact_department = Internal Medicine, Hematology-Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Michigan!Sample_contact_address = 4410 Cancer Center; 1500 E Medical Center Dr!Sample_contact_city = Ann Arbor!Sample_contact_state = MI!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 48109!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1233nnn/GSM1233511/suppl/GSM1233511_Malek_002_ML13-L-T_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1233nnn/GSM1233511/suppl/GSM1233511_Malek_ML013-T.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE50973!Sample_data_row_count = 909508
