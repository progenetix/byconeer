Then it was applied (approx. 44Âµl, leave 2Âµl from the bottom of the tube behind in order to avoid transferring any sediment to the slide) to a clean cover-slip and place on the pre-hybridized microarray. The slide was placed in a hybridization chamber with the printed area and the cover-slip at the top, and was incubated overnight (15-20h) at 55ÂºC in an oven.!Sample_scan_protocol = Slides were scanned for Cy3 and Cy5 following the steps:!Sample_scan_protocol = 1.- Place each slide in a cassette as follows: orient the slide so that it is array-side down and to the left; take cassette flat side down, place on flat surface and push down on the two buttons; with the buttons pressed, insert the slide (keeping everything flat); release buttons when slide has been fully inserted.!Sample_scan_protocol = 2.- Place cassettes into carousel. The etched side should now face to the left, and you should be looking at the back of the slide. Note: the cassette must start with the first slot. The scanner recognizes an empty slot as a sign to stop scanning. Close the scanner top.!Sample_scan_protocol = 3.- Double-click on the Agilent Scanner icon. When it opens, the scanner will go through some initialization steps. Also, if the lasers are not fully warm, there will be a warning sign that will give an approximate time that the lasers will be ready.!Sample_scan_protocol = 4.- Enter your name under Operator and check to see that the controls are set for the following: output directory is D:\niehs; both Red and Green channels are checked and are set to 100%; the size is 10 microns.!Sample_scan_protocol = 5.- Click on Options: choose to scan default slide area under Scan Region Options; specify slide area to largest area under Default Scan Region; click on Instrument serial number under Automatic File Naming (it will then be highlighted). Choose and type in your identifier for that day. Leave the Slot Number as is.!Sample_scan_protocol = 6.- Fill out log in the Scanner Cassette Log with your name, date and the order you put your slides into the carousel. This is important to assure proper renaming after scanning is complete. Click on OK to close the Options window.!Sample_scan_protocol = 7.- Double check that all the settings are properly set and click on Scan.!Sample_scan_protocol = 8.- After scan is complete, you will need to change the names to format pxxsxx. To do this: with the right mouse button, click on the Start menu and choose Explorer. Navigate your way through the files by clicking on the D drive on the far left hand side of the screen. Double click on D drive then double click onniehs. This folder contains all of the scanned files. Locate your slides by looking for the identifier you used for the scan. Click once to highlight name and click once more to get a cursor in the file name. Type in the proper name using the log you filled out earlier. Once all of the names have been changed, highlight the newest slides and move them into the appropriate boxes on Witchfire.!Sample_scan_protocol = 9.- Once you are done, log out of the computer, take the cassettes out of the carousel and your slides out of the cassettes. Turn off scanner.!Sample_description = The goal of this analysis is to see the copy number genes differential changed in lung cancer cell lines in relation with a control (normal females).!Sample_data_processing = Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescent signals were quantified using GenePix Pro 5.0 (Axon Instruments Inc.). Substandard spots were manually flagged and discarded for further analysis. The Cy5/Cy3 ratios were normalized to the median ratio value using the DNMAD tool, based on a print-tip loess method. The conditions for the normalization were: 1) use negative flags, that means that the flagged spots are not used for the normalization and are turned into missing values; 2) do not use background correction. The normalized and semi-logarithmic transformed data were preprocessing using GEPAS software. Conditions for data pre-processing were: 1) merge replicates (the Cy5/Cy3 ratios of replicated spots were averaged); 2) filter missing values in order to exclude for further analysis any gene with data missing in more than 10% of the samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL1998!Sample_contact_name = Pedro,P,Medina-Vico!Sample_contact_email = ppmedinavico@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = Yale University!Sample_contact_address = 266 Whitney Ave, 938 KBT!Sample_contact_city = New Haven!Sample_contact_state = CT!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 06511!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM353nnn/GSM353229/suppl/GSM353229.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14079!Sample_data_row_count = 13056#ID_REF = #F635_Median = Chanel Red Value#B635_Median = Chanel Red Background Value#F532_Median = Chanel Green Value#B532_Median = Chanel Green Background Value#VALUE = log2 of (635/532)#PRE_VALUE = Median of Ratios (635/532)!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635_Median	B635_Median	F532_Median	B532_Median	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	131	350	161	334	0.2881	1.2212	302	341	311	321	0.4792	1.3943	171	314	199	298	0.4605	1.3764	169	318	194	303	0.4340	1.3515	183	321	204	307	0.3807	1.3026	250	302	263	292	0.4297	1.3477	207	279	234	279	0.2987	1.238	247	251	255	257	0.2821	1.2169	2114	233	2138	244	-0.0130	0.99110	393	225	438	235	-0.3076	0.80811	355	196	590	217	-1.2863	0.4112	1131	195	1519	219	-0.4620	0.72613	871	197	1001	220	-0.2159	0.86114	656	176	923	203	-0.6529	0.63615	601	162	737	191	-0.3094	0.80716	558	681	693	589	0.4255	1.34317	347	303	428	301	-0.4921	0.71118	179	324	230	306	0.7536	1.68619	893	333	980	308	-0.3771	0.7720	196	334	220	310	0.4626	1.378!sample_table_end
