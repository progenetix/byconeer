DNA were submitted to a random enzymatic digestion step in reaction containing ultra-pure sterile water, 2.6 ul of 10x buffer, 0.2 ul BSA, 0.5 ml of each enzyme (AluI and RsaI) totaling 26Î¼L. The reactions were incubated at 37 Â° C for 2 hours, 65 Â° C for 20min and kept on ice throughout the procedure. Were added 20Î¼L of the reaction Random Primer (Invitrogen), and then the samples were denatured at 95 Â° C for 5 min and transferred to ice. The reference and test samples were labeled with 1.5 ul of Cy3 and Cy5 dCTPs, respectively added to 5Î¼L of dNTP mix and 1Î¼L of Exo-Klenow enzyme. The labeling reaction was performed at 37 Â° C for 2hours, 65 Â° C for 10min and kept on ice during the reaction. The samples were purified on mini-cellulose columns (Microcon YM-30, Millipore) and resuspended in 21Î¼L of TE (Tris-EDTA) 1x pH = 8.0 (Prodimol).!Sample_source_name_ch2 = reference commercial genomic DNA (Promega), labeled with Cyanine-5 (green).!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = sample type: reference commercial genomic DNA (Promega)!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Genomic DNA from 51 ULs was isolated by the standard procedure using sodium dodecyl sulphate/proteinase K digestion followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation.
