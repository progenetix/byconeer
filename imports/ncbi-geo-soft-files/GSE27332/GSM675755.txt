Filename suffix (e.g. Cy3 or Cy5) indicates Test gDNA dye. Ratios are always Test / Ref. Average Log 2 ratios were computed by inverting dye swapped values.!Sample_data_processing = R using snapCGH bioconductor package!Sample_data_processing = Mean pixel values are background subtracted, median normalized, with replicate spots averaged.
