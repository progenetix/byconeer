Filename suffix (e.g. Cy3 or Cy5) indicates Test gDNA dye. Ratios are always Test / Ref. Average Log 2 ratios were computed by inverting dye swapped values.!Sample_data_processing = R using snapCGH bioconductor package!Sample_data_processing = Mean pixel values are background subtracted, median normalized, with replicate spots averaged. Dye swapped experiments were inverted prior to combining, and averaging.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13177!Sample_contact_name = Ian,,Roberts!Sample_contact_email = ian.roberts@cantab.net!Sample_contact_phone = 0044 1223 763 279!Sample_contact_laboratory = Coleman!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Cell Unit!Sample_contact_institute = Hutchison MRC Research Centre!Sample_contact_address = Hills Road!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB2 0XZ!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM675nnn/GSM675743/suppl/GSM675743_G06Cy3.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM675nnn/GSM675743/suppl/GSM675743_G06Cy5.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27332!Sample_series_id = GSE27333!Sample_data_row_count = 3235#ID_REF = #VALUE = average log2 normalized ratio test/ref!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUECMR_1MbCloneSet_96_1A1	0.130468726CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_9E1	0.365492094CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_3A1	0.731083035CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_3A2	0.472026549CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_1A2	0.345883521CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_3A3	0.427230962CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_1A3	0.368171678CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_28E2	0.305221646CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_3A4	0.570950563CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_3A5	0.277996001CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_3A6	0.331924045CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_3A7	0.543242636CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_13C11	0.46924206CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_3A8	0.304802078CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_1A4	0.348444278CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_3A9	0.560522628CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_1A5	0.107388901CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_3A10	0.388302817CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_1A6	0.800442844CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_3A11	0.509238503!sample_table_end
