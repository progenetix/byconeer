Filename suffix (e.g. Cy3 or Cy5) indicates Test gDNA dye. Ratios are always Test / Ref. Average Log 2 ratios were computed by inverting dye swapped values.!Sample_data_processing = R using snapCGH bioconductor package!Sample_data_processing = Mean pixel values are background subtracted, median normalized, with replicate spots averaged. Dye swapped experiments were inverted prior to combining, and averaging.!Sample_platform_id = GPL13177!Sample_contact_name = Ian,,Roberts!Sample_contact_email = ian.roberts@cantab.net!Sample_contact_phone = 0044 1223 763 279!Sample_contact_laboratory = Coleman!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Cell Unit!Sample_contact_institute = Hutchison MRC Research Centre!Sample_contact_address = Hills Road!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = CB2 0XZ!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM675nnn/GSM675742/suppl/GSM675742_G03Cy3.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM675nnn/GSM675742/suppl/GSM675742_G03Cy5.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27332!Sample_series_id = GSE27333!Sample_data_row_count = 3235#ID_REF = #VALUE = average log2 normalized ratio test/ref!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUECMR_1MbCloneSet_96_1A1	0.263608721CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_9E1	0.214859326CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_3A1	-0.461516172CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_3A2	-0.572984CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_1A2	-0.37221969CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_3A3	-0.425264241CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_1A3	-0.273700838CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_28E2	-0.37733205CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_3A4	-0.475017874CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_3A5	-0.338069545CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_3A6	-0.167063433CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_3A7	-0.341571388CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_13C11	-0.014802343CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_3A8	-0.325810779CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_1A4	-0.419143842CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_3A9	-0.454344535CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_1A5	-0.420565336CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_3A10	-0.410238194CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_1A6	-0.526177765CMR_1MbCloneSet_96_3A11	-0.346665623!sample_table_end
