Patient and normal control DNAs (reference) were mixed and hybridized with Human Cot I DNA (Invitrogen) at 65Â°C for 24 hours. The sandwiched slides were hybridized for 24 hours at 65Â°C with 15 rotations per minute and washed according to the Agilent protocol.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2565BA).!Sample_description = Reference sample: Pool of six normal control DNAs from six healthy donors!Sample_data_processing = Log2 ratios (contained in sample data table below) were determined with Agilent Feature Extraction software (v 9.1.3.1). Results were visualized and analyzed with Agilentâs CGH Analytics v3.5 software, and copy number aberrations were detected with the Aberration Detection Method 2 (ADM-2) algorithm using a threshold value of 6.0. This threshold value of the altered copy number was determined from the normal variation in the control hybridization.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = A visual estimation of ADM-2 microdeletions length was obtained with the last proximal and distal non deleted probe locations using a *DNA analytics* (Agilent software) algorithm. The result of this analysis can be found in the 'microdeletion sub type' sample characteristic listed above.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9852!Sample_contact_name = Eric,,Pasmant!Sample_contact_email = eric.pasmant@gmail.com!Sample_contact_department = EA7331!Sample_contact_institute = Paris Descartes University!Sample_contact_address = FacultÃ© de Pharmacie de Paris, 4 avenue de lâObservatoire!Sample_contact_city = Paris!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75006!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM492nnn/GSM492725/suppl/GSM492725.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19730!Sample_data_row_count = 15689#ID_REF = Custom CGH probe reference number (RefNumber)#VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (Cy5/Cy3) representing test/reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	2.315530326e-0012	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	2.256157911e-0015	-1.326458118e-0016	-2.039332510e-0017	1.923890050e-0018	-1.568871831e-0029	-3.916229175e-00110	-1.162259467e-00111	4.065438589e-00212	-2.061454090e-00113	1.550682525e-00114	7.680617532e-00215	1.219815314e-00216	1.246900015e-00117	2.795074463e-00318	-3.113843808e-00119	-9.915693469e-00220	1.265979064e-001!sample_table_end
