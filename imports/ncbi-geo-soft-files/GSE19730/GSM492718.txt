Patient and normal control DNAs (reference) were mixed and hybridized with Human Cot I DNA (Invitrogen) at 65Â°C for 24 hours. The sandwiched slides were hybridized for 24 hours at 65Â°C with 15 rotations per minute and washed according to the Agilent protocol.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2565BA).!Sample_description = Reference sample: Pool of six normal control DNAs from six healthy donors!Sample_data_processing = Log2 ratios (contained in sample data table below) were determined with Agilent Feature Extraction software (v 9.1.3.1). Results were visualized and analyzed with Agilentâs CGH Analytics v3.5 software, and copy number aberrations were detected with the Aberration Detection Method 2 (ADM-2) algorithm using a threshold value of 6.0. This threshold value of the altered copy number was determined from the normal variation in the control hybridization.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = A visual estimation of ADM-2 microdeletions length was obtained with the last proximal and distal non deleted probe locations using a *DNA analytics* (Agilent software) algorithm. The result of this analysis can be found in the 'microdeletion sub type' sample characteristic listed above.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9852!Sample_contact_name = Eric,,Pasmant!Sample_contact_email = eric.pasmant@gmail.com!Sample_contact_department = EA7331!Sample_contact_institute = Paris Descartes University!Sample_contact_address = FacultÃ© de Pharmacie de Paris, 4 avenue de lâObservatoire!Sample_contact_city = Paris!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75006!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM492nnn/GSM492718/suppl/GSM492718.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19730!Sample_data_row_count = 15689#ID_REF = Custom CGH probe reference number (RefNumber)#VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (Cy5/Cy3) representing test/reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	1.995929952e-0012	0.000000000e+0003	3.144708107e-0014	2.013813750e-0015	-2.018959565e-0016	-2.232965309e-0017	1.204532620e-0018	1.947856654e-0029	-3.843539847e-00110	-1.116680329e-00111	8.631300009e-00312	-2.240954718e-00113	1.613715872e-00114	5.319447196e-00215	2.478260240e-00316	1.058809402e-00117	7.212069895e-00318	-1.714923335e-00119	-1.998172241e-00120	1.095169538e-001!sample_table_end
