Patient and normal control DNAs (reference) were mixed and hybridized with Human Cot I DNA (Invitrogen) at 65Â°C for 24 hours. The sandwiched slides were hybridized for 24 hours at 65Â°C with 15 rotations per minute and washed according to the Agilent protocol.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2565BA).!Sample_description = Reference sample: Pool of six normal control DNAs from six healthy donors!Sample_data_processing = Log2 ratios (contained in sample data table below) were determined with Agilent Feature Extraction software (v 9.1.3.1). Results were visualized and analyzed with Agilentâs CGH Analytics v3.5 software, and copy number aberrations were detected with the Aberration Detection Method 2 (ADM-2) algorithm using a threshold value of 6.0. This threshold value of the altered copy number was determined from the normal variation in the control hybridization.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = A visual estimation of ADM-2 microdeletions length was obtained with the last proximal and distal non deleted probe locations using a *DNA analytics* (Agilent software) algorithm. The result of this analysis can be found in the 'microdeletion sub type' sample characteristic listed above.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9852!Sample_contact_name = Eric,,Pasmant!Sample_contact_email = eric.pasmant@gmail.com!Sample_contact_department = EA7331!Sample_contact_institute = Paris Descartes University!Sample_contact_address = FacultÃ© de Pharmacie de Paris, 4 avenue de lâObservatoire!Sample_contact_city = Paris!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75006!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM492nnn/GSM492737/suppl/GSM492737.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19730!Sample_data_row_count = 15689#ID_REF = Custom CGH probe reference number (RefNumber)#VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (Cy5/Cy3) representing test/reference!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	1.347118208e-0012	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	1.488119300e-0015	-2.110153858e-0016	-2.309328455e-0017	1.453972720e-0018	3.689840442e-0029	-2.201756762e-00110	-3.933128106e-00211	4.324435959e-00212	-1.323611674e-00113	1.861306873e-00114	7.001407781e-00215	1.270236304e-00216	1.031472842e-00217	-7.628775143e-00218	-2.668313434e-00119	-2.777613959e-00120	2.542531991e-002!sample_table_end
