The log2ratio of Cy5 (tumor) to Cy3 (Control) was normalized by the Centralization Algorithm in DNA Analytics. Aberrant regions were determined by the ADM-2 algorithm at a threshold of 12.0 in DNA Analytics. To detect gains and losses, we set the values of parameters for aberration filters as: minimum number of probes in region 2, minimum absolute average log2ratio for region 0.263034, maximum number of aberrant regions 10000, and percentage penetrance per feature 0. We set the value of the minimum absolute average log2ratio at 0.263034 to detect regions showing a change in the averaged copy number equal to or more than 1.2-fold (log2(1.2)=0.263034).!Sample_platform_id = GPL5477!Sample_contact_name = Toru,,Inoue!Sample_contact_email = i-toru@med.oita-u.ac.jp!Sample_contact_fax = +81-97-586-5699!Sample_contact_department = Department of Molecular Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Faculty of medicineOita University!Sample_contact_address = Hasama-machi 1-1!Sample_contact_city = Yufu-City, Oita!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 879-5593!Sample_contact_country = Japan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM707nnn/GSM707851/suppl/GSM707851_E51_US45102856_251495023406_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07_1_4.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28601!Sample_data_row_count = 45214#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	1.090972959e-0012	5.401863894e-0013	7.228604590e-0014	4.256225805e-0015	3.628780465e-0016	1.463177153e-0017	1.593022789e-0018	2.334674426e-0019	0.000000000e+00010	3.298857620e-00111	0.000000000e+00012	1.144946157e-00113	-8.487099507e-00214	-1.428259897e-00115	-6.064641635e-00216	3.203957879e-00117	-4.144479596e-00218	2.174328785e-00119	1.213190840e-00120	4.341782536e-001!sample_table_end
