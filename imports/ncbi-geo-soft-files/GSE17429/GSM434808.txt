PMID: 18077431).  Normalized data was then segmented with GenePattern modules based on the GLAD algorithm.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Alexis,,Ramos!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02142!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM434nnn/GSM434808/suppl/GSM434808_Daffy4T.cel.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE17429!Sample_data_row_count = 228209#ID_REF = #VALUE = Signal: log2 copy number ratio (see data processing)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1909444	0.1379SNP_A-2237149	0.1379SNP_A-4303947	0.1379SNP_A-2236359	0.1379SNP_A-2205441	0.1379SNP_A-2116190	0.1379SNP_A-4291020	0.1379SNP_A-2109914	0.1379SNP_A-2291997	0.1379SNP_A-4277872	0.1379SNP_A-2118217	0.1379SNP_A-1866065	0.1379SNP_A-2288244	0.1379SNP_A-1783407	0.1379SNP_A-2169457	0.1379SNP_A-4271011	0.1379SNP_A-2082515	0.1379SNP_A-1910751	0.1379SNP_A-2081399	0.1379SNP_A-2223642	0.1379!sample_table_end
