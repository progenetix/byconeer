Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320940/suppl/GSM320940.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2632	2421	2631.2319000000002	2419.5412000000001	0.91954689999999994	0.67420351000000001	0.61691980000000002	-0.1281	0.915035000000000042	4901	5206	4873.9228000000003	5209.1959999999999	1.0687892000000001	1.4342158	1.5010022999999999	0.0657	1.04656663	1863	1814	1866.8738000000001	1815.5327	0.9724988	0.51560642000000001	0.50221988000000006	-0.0380	0.974037299999999994	16254	14898	15876.011	15038.991	0.9472777	4.2262791999999996	3.9970368999999999	-0.0805	0.945757900000000045	16861	21719	16454.558000000001	22014.580000000002	1.3379015999999999	4.9007778000000002	6.7002185000000001	0.4512	1.36717456	8619	7676	8507.8065000000006	7715.1344000000008	0.90683000000000002	2.5023569999999999	2.3002118	-0.1215	0.919218100000000047	3146	3556	3141.4348	3556.7800999999999	1.1322152000000001	0.93625608999999999	1.1935997	0.3503	1.27486459999999998	2612	3024	2611.4067	3021.1632	1.1569103000000001	0.70790284000000003	0.80967071000000002	0.1938	1.14375969999999999	4699	5933	4675.1163999999999	5947.8576000000003	1.2722373	1.2745388	1.5824601	0.3122	1.241594310	13777	13632	13497.769	13750.396000000001	1.0187162000000001	3.9550942	3.8934574	-0.0227	0.9844158000000000611	15429	14383	15088.093000000001	14513.482	0.9619162	4.2835611	4.0419162000000002	-0.0838	0.9435877999999999812	7888	6292	7794.9787000000006	6313.5113000000001	0.8099459	2.6605005999999998	2.3118081999999998	-0.2027	0.8689373000000000213	1733	1644	1737.6162000000002	1648.3072	0.94860259999999996	0.65312152000000001	0.64034349000000002	-0.0285	0.9804355000000000214	13654	12228	13379.745000000001	12322.473	0.92097960000000001	3.8886456999999996	3.5459735999999999	-0.1331	0.9118787999999999915	2825	2863	2821.0751	2857.8959	1.0130520000000001	0.85975422000000001	0.89926280999999997	0.0648	1.045953399999999916	2717	3183	2715.4695000000002	3182.2381	1.1718923999999999	0.85898496000000002	1.1160158	0.3777	1.299226199999999917	630	599	633.05616000000009	618.79908	0.97747899999999999	0.18386495999999999	0.17676349	-0.0568	0.9613766999999999718	4189	3983	4174.3015999999998	3985.8520000000003	0.9548548	1.1995216	1.1681535999999999	-0.0382	0.9738495999999999819	2136	1990	2140.5427	1990.1426000000001	0.92973740000000005	0.63897687000000003	0.57741271000000005	-0.1462	0.9036520000000000120	2227	2258	2231.8998999999999	2258.1732999999999	1.0117718	0.74737695999999998	0.69855086	-0.0975	0.93467!sample_table_end
