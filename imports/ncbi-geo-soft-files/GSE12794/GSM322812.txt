Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322812/suppl/GSM322812.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1468.5599999999999	1824.8399999999999	1475.3299999999999	1784.5999999999999	1.20963	1.2919400000000001	1.58649	0.2963	1.22798999999999992	6961.0600000000004	11711.9	7137.6999999999998	11027.6	1.54498	8.2001000000000008	11.375299999999999	0.4722	1.38721999999999993	214.08000000000001	115.43600000000001	171.85400000000001	163.422	0.95093300000000003	0.12573899999999999	0.13367299999999999	0.0883	1.06309999999999994	5580.9799999999996	6361.1599999999999	5716.2299999999996	5978.5699999999997	1.04589	4.8774100000000002	5.8841299999999999	0.2707	1.206415	512.62199999999996	358.791	479.16000000000003	399.19900000000001	0.83312200000000003	0.44783899999999999	0.37317600000000001	-0.2631	0.8332836	371.60399999999998	251.511	328.02999999999997	295.98399999999998	0.90230900000000003	0.30166700000000002	0.27224599999999999	-0.1480	0.9024747	2509.27	2687.4699999999998	2548.3200000000002	2589.4000000000001	1.0161199999999999	2.59192	2.69902	0.0584	1.041328	1453.96	1377.5999999999999	1460.21	1363.5899999999999	0.93382600000000004	1.56135	1.3554299999999999	-0.2040	0.868117999999999959	4507.0900000000001	4269.1599999999999	4601.9099999999999	4063.5999999999999	0.88302400000000003	4.5805699999999998	3.96428	-0.2085	0.8654549999999999710	223.80500000000001	132.72	180.08000000000001	180.85599999999999	1.00431	0.19773099999999999	0.18921499999999999	-0.0635	0.9569309999999999811	441.80900000000003	369.01299999999998	403.49799999999999	409.00200000000001	1.0136400000000001	0.341808	0.34309600000000001	0.0054	1.003770000000000112	442.98000000000002	280.48500000000001	403.16000000000003	324.93700000000001	0.80597600000000003	0.36337799999999998	0.30210500000000001	-0.2664	0.8313810000000000413	4458.8100000000004	4330.1499999999996	4550.8400000000001	4121.46	0.90564699999999998	3.9462199999999998	3.6424799999999999	-0.1155	0.9230310000000000514	3693.96	3457.2800000000002	3765.4099999999999	3310.1399999999999	0.87909099999999996	3.3998200000000001	3.0787499999999999	-0.1431	0.9055630000000000115	922.13800000000003	484.58199999999999	909.18700000000001	519.12699999999995	0.57097900000000001	0.79300099999999996	0.53127800000000003	-0.5779	0.6699589999999999716	1307.6500000000001	1019.03	1309.3900000000001	1026.3399999999999	0.78382799999999997	1.4289000000000001	1.08165	-0.4017	0.7569780000000000417	3693.96	3457.2800000000002	3765.4099999999999	3310.1399999999999	0.87909099999999996	3.3998200000000001	3.0787499999999999	-0.1431	0.9055630000000000118	4458.8100000000004	4330.1499999999996	4550.8400000000001	4121.46	0.90564699999999998	3.9462199999999998	3.6424799999999999	-0.1155	0.9230310000000000519	442.98000000000002	280.48500000000001	403.16000000000003	324.93700000000001	0.80597600000000003	0.36337799999999998	0.30210500000000001	-0.2664	0.8313810000000000420	1804.5799999999999	2001.5999999999999	1824.02	1949.99	1.0690599999999999	1.72339	2.12859	0.3047	1.23512!sample_table_end
