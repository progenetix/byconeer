Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322770/suppl/GSM322770.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	543.39999999999998	394.24400000000003	502.01499999999999	427.94999999999999	0.852464	1.06813	1.0648500000000001	-0.0044	0.996920999999999952	2799.9400000000001	4353.9799999999996	2659.6199999999999	3911.75	1.47079	4.7395500000000004	6.7491899999999996	0.5100	1.42402000000000013	269.48899999999998	86.911000000000001	201.59200000000001	144.852	0.71854200000000001	0.26606800000000003	0.25070700000000001	-0.0858	0.942266000000000054	9252.75	5457.9700000000003	9142.6700000000001	4872.6700000000001	0.53295899999999996	9.12791	8.3977299999999993	-0.1203	0.920004999999999965	251.316	122.50700000000001	184.291	180.739	0.98072499999999996	0.29599700000000001	0.33279900000000001	0.1691	1.12433000000000016	261.95600000000002	111.089	194.15000000000001	169.45099999999999	0.87278299999999998	0.46465600000000001	0.38237599999999999	-0.2812	0.822922999999999967	914.471	704.30200000000002	873.49699999999996	701.053	0.80258200000000002	1.9331100000000001	1.69068	-0.1933	0.874593999999999988	502.62200000000001	487.88900000000001	459.75400000000002	510.82600000000002	1.1110800000000001	1.14269	1.03867	-0.1377	0.9089729	1132	1174.23	1035.05	1131	1.0927	2.5874199999999998	2.5880899999999998	0.0004	1.000259999999999910	277.52199999999999	71.698099999999997	213.58699999999999	128.68000000000001	0.60246900000000003	0.47069100000000003	0.241762	-0.9612	0.5136309999999999511	276.60000000000002	151.756	208.679	208.71100000000001	1.0001599999999999	0.48647099999999999	0.460725	-0.0784	0.9470760000000000312	281.65600000000001	100.629	217.09399999999999	159.25700000000001	0.73358299999999999	0.54987200000000003	0.392878	-0.4850	0.7144890000000000413	1201.3	1244.1900000000001	1148.1300000000001	1183.8199999999999	1.0310900000000001	2.5301200000000001	2.6771600000000002	0.0815	1.058119999999999914	1931.96	2025.96	1844.3	1882.76	1.02085	4.0626199999999999	4.1458199999999996	0.0292	1.020480000000000115	2402.5599999999999	1730.4400000000001	2283.8699999999999	1602.0899999999999	0.70147899999999996	2.6107399999999998	2.6484800000000002	0.0207	1.014450000000000116	962.91800000000001	1184.0899999999999	920.41300000000001	1125.45	1.2227699999999999	2.0220199999999999	2.2002100000000002	0.1219	1.0881317	1931.96	2025.96	1844.3	1882.76	1.02085	4.0626199999999999	4.1458199999999996	0.0292	1.020480000000000118	1201.3	1244.1900000000001	1148.1300000000001	1183.8199999999999	1.0310900000000001	2.5301200000000001	2.6771600000000002	0.0815	1.058119999999999919	281.65600000000001	100.629	217.09399999999999	159.25700000000001	0.73358299999999999	0.54987200000000003	0.392878	-0.4850	0.7144890000000000420	868.48000000000002	692.79600000000005	828.58500000000004	690.94000000000005	0.83387999999999995	1.0811200000000001	1.17946	0.1256	1.0909599999999999!sample_table_end
