Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322758/suppl/GSM322758.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	574.947	627.20899999999995	585.72699999999998	615.52300000000002	1.05087	0.90560700000000005	0.93317099999999997	0.0433	1.030442	7568.0900000000001	7899.2200000000003	7721.5	7641.4799999999996	0.98963699999999999	8.4319299999999995	8.1198300000000003	-0.0544	0.962986000000000013	185.911	194.911	193.30699999999999	191.20599999999999	0.98912999999999995	0.20871300000000001	0.219441	0.0723	1.05139999999999994	15564.4	13957.1	15853.799999999999	13568	0.85582100000000005	17.996700000000001	16.368099999999998	-0.1368	0.909507999999999985	304.75599999999997	268.80000000000001	313.08300000000003	264.08999999999997	0.84351299999999996	0.357018	0.31116899999999997	-0.1983	0.871577999999999966	282.60000000000002	309.46699999999998	290.738	304.06	1.04582	0.356462	0.37367899999999998	0.0681	1.04837	629.51599999999996	635.04399999999998	641.06500000000005	623.18200000000002	0.97210399999999997	1.1353500000000001	1.08778	-0.0618	0.958099000000000038	488.55599999999998	550.22199999999998	498.48599999999999	540.36800000000005	1.08402	0.55623599999999995	0.599657	0.1084	1.078069	1270.1400000000001	1193.05	1292.46	1164.6600000000001	0.90111399999999997	1.8051600000000001	1.60371	-0.1707	0.8884069999999999510	151.78899999999999	176.959	159.34700000000001	173.44300000000001	1.08846	0.20826900000000001	0.22209799999999999	0.0927	1.066411	358.75599999999997	365.78199999999998	367.72800000000001	359.32600000000002	0.97715099999999999	0.43290200000000001	0.43448500000000001	0.0053	1.0036612	175.309	214.042	182.73400000000001	210.125	1.1498999999999999	0.301593	0.34551700000000002	0.1962	1.1456413	2063.29	1860.3299999999999	2098.5900000000001	1809.4300000000001	0.86221199999999998	2.8098200000000002	2.4603199999999998	-0.1916	0.87561414	1885.48	1964.55	1919.49	1909.77	0.99493600000000004	2.6017199999999998	2.6454599999999999	0.0241	1.0168115	1082.3699999999999	862.42700000000002	1100.47	844.40099999999995	0.76731199999999999	1.22489	1.0299499999999999	-0.2501	0.8408560000000000516	1206.0699999999999	1243.5699999999999	1225.9300000000001	1214.2	0.99043400000000004	1.5057100000000001	1.4820500000000001	-0.0229	0.9842840000000000517	1885.48	1964.55	1919.49	1909.77	0.99493600000000004	2.6017199999999998	2.6454599999999999	0.0241	1.0168118	2063.29	1860.3299999999999	2098.5900000000001	1809.4300000000001	0.86221199999999998	2.8098200000000002	2.4603199999999998	-0.1916	0.87561419	175.309	214.042	182.73400000000001	210.125	1.1498999999999999	0.301593	0.34551700000000002	0.1962	1.1456420	1400.9200000000001	1433.5599999999999	1423.8399999999999	1397.78	0.98169600000000001	1.6663399999999999	1.7812399999999999	0.0962	1.0689500000000001!sample_table_end
