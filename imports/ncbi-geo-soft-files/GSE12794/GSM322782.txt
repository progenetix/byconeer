Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322782/suppl/GSM322782.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	843.64400000000001	880.96000000000004	809.64400000000001	908.92499999999995	1.12262	1.26641	1.4004099999999999	0.1451	1.105812	6181.8800000000001	6226.3800000000001	6252.96	6038.8199999999997	0.96575500000000003	7.7763099999999996	7.7684100000000003	-0.0015	0.998985000000000013	272.92899999999997	115.64	247.286	138.44800000000001	0.55987100000000001	0.32108999999999999	0.199744	-0.6848	0.622082000000000024	12906.799999999999	12355.299999999999	13311	11858	0.89084399999999997	16.130099999999999	16.306799999999999	0.0157	1.01096000000000015	264.66699999999997	233.02199999999999	239.22	259.46800000000002	1.08464	0.28559600000000002	0.330899	0.2124	1.158626	243.511	204.02199999999999	218.66300000000001	229.63300000000001	1.05017	0.31009700000000001	0.340725	0.1359	1.098777	1071.25	1174.03	1035.8	1197.4400000000001	1.15605	1.7622500000000001	1.96471	0.1569	1.11488000000000018	691.49800000000005	660.66700000000003	658.73900000000003	689.74000000000001	1.0470600000000001	0.78467799999999999	0.81262400000000001	0.0505	1.035629	2540.3800000000001	2048.1900000000001	2516.6500000000001	2046.5999999999999	0.81322399999999995	3.3971800000000001	2.7507799999999998	-0.3045	0.8097259999999999510	160.209	130.27799999999999	140.71799999999999	153.72900000000001	1.09246	0.200265	0.20816100000000001	0.0558	1.039430000000000111	415.71100000000001	429.19999999999999	386.673	458.29899999999998	1.1852400000000001	0.49328100000000003	0.59548100000000004	0.2716	1.207179999999999912	250.91300000000001	186.40199999999999	225.709	211.773	0.93825599999999998	0.39195099999999999	0.35692200000000002	-0.1351	0.9106300000000000513	2351.7600000000002	2081.8899999999999	2325.2800000000002	2079.8499999999999	0.89445200000000002	3.6526800000000001	3.30314	-0.1451	0.9043060000000000514	3520.3899999999999	3348.3899999999999	3514.5900000000001	3295.96	0.93779400000000002	5.3708799999999997	5.1356999999999999	-0.0646	0.9562119999999999515	917.55600000000004	843.88900000000001	883.18200000000002	872.15599999999995	0.98751599999999995	1.2226300000000001	1.3721699999999999	0.1665	1.122309999999999916	1716.99	1685.97	1682.8499999999999	1696.1800000000001	1.0079199999999999	1.9678199999999999	2.03328	0.0472	1.033269999999999917	3520.3899999999999	3348.3899999999999	3514.5900000000001	3295.96	0.93779400000000002	5.3708799999999997	5.1356999999999999	-0.0646	0.9562119999999999518	2351.7600000000002	2081.8899999999999	2325.2800000000002	2079.8499999999999	0.89445200000000002	3.6526800000000001	3.30314	-0.1451	0.9043060000000000519	250.91300000000001	186.40199999999999	225.709	211.773	0.93825599999999998	0.39195099999999999	0.35692200000000002	-0.1351	0.9106300000000000520	768.08900000000006	694.72900000000004	734.38999999999999	723.72500000000002	0.98547799999999997	1.27708	1.3755900000000001	0.1072	1.07714!sample_table_end
