Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320930/suppl/GSM320930.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2248	1959	2240.5306	1967.2503000000002	0.87802875999999996	0.77204389000000007	0.69855487000000005	-0.1443	0.904812379999999972	2131	2251	2121.8421000000003	2256.6739000000002	1.06354467	0.83751571000000002	0.89730487000000003	0.0995	1.07138873	1537	1524	1529.1300000000001	1534.9765	1.00382342	0.58394307000000001	0.59113484999999999	0.0177	1.01231589999999994	12600	10308	12347.411	10275.242	0.83217781000000002	5.6542747999999996	4.8634732999999999	-0.2174	0.860140950000000025	14198	20586	13868.290000000001	20773.649000000001	1.4979243600000001	6.2393216999999996	9.0498943000000001	0.5365	1.45046119999999996	8704	8595	8581.6431000000011	8571.2965000000004	0.99879432999999995	3.6766931999999999	3.6665463999999997	-0.0040	0.997240230000000067	2201	2631	2192.8857000000003	2630.5921000000003	1.1996029500000001	1.0855713	1.4119527999999999	0.3792	1.30065419999999998	2181	2140	2172.5828000000001	2145.8548000000001	0.98769761	0.86877183000000002	0.87503584000000001	0.0104	1.00721020000000019	2481	2477	2471.6628000000001	2481.1213000000002	1.0038267700000001	0.90520531999999998	0.92230168000000001	0.0270	1.018886699999999910	11112	11551	10920.813	11527.793	1.0555801300000001	4.4032236999999999	4.4940512999999997	0.0295	1.020627511	9712	9719	9564.5167000000001	9688.1103000000003	1.0129220999999999	3.7676686999999998	3.8123259999999997	0.0170	1.011852812	8665	6075	8543.4595000000008	6071.7545	0.71069039000000001	3.9146109	2.8526010999999998	-0.4566	0.7287061700000000413	1549	1736	1541.3002000000001	1743.3261	1.1310749600000001	0.72588975	0.77387649999999997	0.0924	1.066107514	10414	9279	10251.213	9250.5534000000007	0.90238624999999995	3.9542892999999997	3.5688134999999996	-0.1480	0.9025170500000000415	1829	1760	1821.4082000000001	1767.1793	0.97022693999999998	0.69763660000000005	0.68610493000000006	-0.0240	0.9834703700000000416	1485	2008	1476.2281	2015.6095	1.3653781300000001	0.69225237000000006	0.99178042	0.5187	1.432686217	585	595	575.92010000000005	620.46850000000006	1.0773516000000001	0.228246	0.24849450000000001	0.1226	1.088713499999999918	4114	4234	4086.2656000000002	4219.6138000000001	1.03263328	1.5704743999999999	1.5218354999999999	-0.0454	0.9690292000000000319	1436	1375	1426.8753000000002	1388.4911	0.97309909000000006	0.56772031000000001	0.55419594000000005	-0.0348	0.9761777500000000720	2197	2052	2188.8240000000001	2058.8107	0.94060131999999996	0.8471805	0.78416467000000001	-0.1115	0.92561700000000002!sample_table_end
