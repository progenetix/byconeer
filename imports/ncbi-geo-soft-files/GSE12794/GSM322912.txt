Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322912/suppl/GSM322912.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1769.23	1936.28	1941.4200000000001	1756.71	0.90485899999999997	1.4892000000000001	1.4446399999999999	-0.0438	0.970080999999999972	5968.1099999999997	7433.0200000000004	6475.46	6742.0200000000004	1.0411600000000001	8.0183099999999996	7.8051000000000004	-0.0389	0.973413	238.11099999999999	185.11099999999999	247.053	186.631	0.75542699999999996	0.185585	0.13794400000000001	-0.4280	0.743291000000000044	10916.700000000001	12876.799999999999	11625.799999999999	11849.6	1.01925	9.7362199999999994	9.1975300000000004	-0.0821	0.944672999999999985	241.53299999999999	229.37799999999999	250.89599999999999	226.226	0.90167299999999995	0.21601300000000001	0.17880799999999999	-0.2727	0.8277626	370.24000000000001	378.51999999999998	395.89499999999998	359.36599999999999	0.90773099999999995	0.32020700000000002	0.301487	-0.0869	0.941537999999999997	3927.8899999999999	4277.3800000000001	4289.9700000000003	3861.75	0.90018100000000001	3.1176300000000001	2.9414699999999998	-0.0839	0.943497000000000038	606.28399999999999	1073.1199999999999	659.81399999999996	980.88699999999994	1.48661	0.70860100000000004	1.0379499999999999	0.5507	1.464799	3040.3400000000001	3771.6500000000001	3322.6700000000001	3410.0100000000002	1.0262899999999999	2.8776000000000002	2.9177	0.0200	1.013940000000000110	126.995	134.00399999999999	125.974	140.50999999999999	1.1153900000000001	0.10582800000000001	0.121499	0.1992	1.1480811	105.35599999999999	72.400000000000006	103.88200000000001	82.246899999999997	0.79173400000000005	0.075646000000000005	0.0632191	-0.2589	0.8357229999999999912	516.10900000000004	557.98199999999997	558.06600000000003	520.81500000000005	0.933249	0.43598599999999998	0.43022199999999999	-0.0192	0.9867799999999999913	3664.9200000000001	3989.6900000000001	4000.8800000000001	3610.48	0.90242299999999998	3.0929600000000002	2.9245100000000002	-0.0808	0.9455379999999999914	6173.8599999999997	7102.9300000000003	6661.5100000000002	6472.96	0.97169499999999998	5.4874200000000002	5.3588500000000003	-0.0342	0.9765709999999999715	962.55600000000004	1273.22	1055.3900000000001	1160.1500000000001	1.0992599999999999	0.968059	0.97407200000000005	0.0089	1.0062116	2014.99	2683.1999999999998	2210.6100000000001	2426.48	1.09765	2.1743800000000002	2.3679100000000002	0.1230	1.08917	6173.8599999999997	7102.9300000000003	6661.5100000000002	6472.96	0.97169499999999998	5.4874200000000002	5.3588500000000003	-0.0342	0.9765709999999999718	3664.9200000000001	3989.6900000000001	4000.8800000000001	3610.48	0.90242299999999998	3.0929600000000002	2.9245100000000002	-0.0808	0.9455379999999999919	516.10900000000004	557.98199999999997	558.06600000000003	520.81500000000005	0.933249	0.43598599999999998	0.43022199999999999	-0.0192	0.9867799999999999920	2634.1100000000001	3365.9699999999998	2885.5799999999999	3038.8899999999999	1.0531299999999999	2.1111399999999998	2.2534200000000002	0.0941	1.0673900000000001!sample_table_end
