Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322810/suppl/GSM322810.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3415.4899999999998	3143.52	3264.77	3221.1399999999999	0.98663800000000001	2.43573	2.4796499999999999	0.0258	1.018032	19915.700000000001	19359.799999999999	18909.799999999999	19886.599999999999	1.05165	13.194800000000001	13.420500000000001	0.0245	1.01709999999999993	255.18199999999999	168.69800000000001	233.768	193.49000000000001	0.82769999999999999	0.153055	0.13965	-0.1322	0.9124164	32854.199999999997	25729.400000000001	31091.799999999999	26523.400000000001	0.85306800000000005	21.3538	20.706900000000001	-0.0444	0.969709000000000045	1137.1600000000001	928.31100000000004	1081.45	982.92899999999997	0.90890300000000002	0.74807900000000005	0.69560900000000003	-0.1049	0.929861000000000056	576.91099999999994	539.947	542.26900000000001	583.04600000000005	1.0751999999999999	0.38799299999999998	0.422601	0.1233	1.08919999999999997	3857.7600000000002	4009.8800000000001	3686.7600000000002	4088.8800000000001	1.10907	3.2574399999999999	3.6138599999999999	0.1498	1.10942000000000018	1989.3099999999999	2088.1999999999998	1899.27	2157.75	1.13609	1.33507	1.3996299999999999	0.0681	1.04834999999999999	9077.4899999999998	7557.8999999999996	8634.0200000000004	7684.8100000000004	0.89006200000000002	6.6794900000000004	5.6931500000000002	-0.2305	0.8523330000000000110	190.708	154.62899999999999	173.40899999999999	178.488	1.02929	0.139045	0.13567499999999999	-0.0354	0.9757649999999999911	126.64400000000001	121.59999999999999	114.18300000000001	142.834	1.25092	0.077305399999999996	0.098917099999999994	0.3556	1.2795612	1006.36	946.197	956.12900000000002	1001.3	1.0472399999999999	0.78327500000000005	0.85024900000000003	0.1184	1.0855113	6209.0600000000004	4722.8400000000001	5908.8999999999996	4809.1000000000004	0.81387399999999999	4.4509600000000002	3.7971300000000001	-0.2292	0.8531039999999999714	3753.73	3212.4299999999998	3577.0900000000001	3298.77	0.92219399999999996	2.7876099999999999	2.6242899999999998	-0.0871	0.9414099999999999715	1462.02	1140.76	1392.25	1199.29	0.86140700000000003	0.981182	1.02935	0.0691	1.049090000000000116	1517.23	1572.5899999999999	1445.3	1637.74	1.1331500000000001	1.06711	1.1605799999999999	0.1211	1.087590000000000117	3753.73	3212.4299999999998	3577.0900000000001	3298.77	0.92219399999999996	2.7876099999999999	2.6242899999999998	-0.0871	0.9414099999999999718	6209.0600000000004	4722.8400000000001	5908.8999999999996	4809.1000000000004	0.81387399999999999	4.4509600000000002	3.7971300000000001	-0.2292	0.8531039999999999719	1006.36	946.197	956.12900000000002	1001.3	1.0472399999999999	0.78327500000000005	0.85024900000000003	0.1184	1.0855120	3061.2800000000002	2238.8899999999999	2921.7199999999998	2308.8899999999999	0.79025000000000001	2.14141	2.1111399999999998	-0.0205	0.98586099999999999!sample_table_end
