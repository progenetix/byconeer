Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320942/suppl/GSM320942.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1976	1865	1954.4678000000001	1888.7286000000001	0.96636469999999997	0.56432769000000005	0.53632065000000007	-0.0734	0.950370999999999972	4035	4340	3990.4769000000001	4369.0603000000001	1.0948716999999999	1.1898682999999999	1.2779019999999999	0.1030	1.07398599999999993	1544	1291	1525.8203000000001	1318.5621000000001	0.86416599999999999	0.56409931999999996	0.49444755000000001	-0.1901	0.876525699999999964	10927	10004	10738.334000000001	10041.046	0.93506549999999999	4.1803188000000002	3.9302666999999998	-0.0890	0.940183500000000065	11380	13707	11182.959000000001	13713.727000000001	1.2263058	4.8372261999999999	6.0911036999999997	0.3325	1.25921409999999996	7105	7198	6981.2392	7244.9268000000002	1.0377708999999999	2.6405194999999999	2.7980225000000001	0.0836	1.05964857	2324	2419	2299.7458000000001	2440.9970000000003	1.0614204	0.93159256000000001	1.1049358999999999	0.2462	1.18607209999999998	2175	2330	2152.0019000000002	2350.7726000000002	1.0923655000000001	0.72945126999999998	0.81202890000000005	0.1547	1.11320510000000019	3275	3570	3236.8641000000002	3597.0765000000001	1.1112844	0.90269463000000005	0.98366308000000002	0.1239	1.089696410	11507	11774	11307.607	11795.147000000001	1.0431161	3.7733268	3.7918997999999999	0.0071	1.004922211	12535	11808	12327.996999999999	11828.592000000001	0.95949019999999996	4.0320822999999999	3.8780668999999999	-0.0562	0.961802512	6836	5270	6718.7175999999999	5317.326	0.79141980000000001	2.4861920999999998	2.0903749999999999	-0.2502	0.8407938000000000413	2153	2243	2130.2138	2262.9873000000002	1.0623286999999999	0.79469074000000006	0.84917637000000001	0.0957	1.06856214	10131	9323	9956.4847000000009	9367.2041000000008	0.94081440000000005	3.5006211	3.1925029999999999	-0.1329	0.9119819000000000115	2426	2214	2401.0018	2234.2382000000002	0.93054420000000004	0.78249731	0.74833057999999997	-0.0644	0.9563363000000000316	2185	2429	2161.9055000000003	2451.0392999999999	1.1337402999999999	0.78923858999999996	0.98164428999999997	0.3147	1.243786499999999917	803	757	794.10415000000012	788.35958000000005	0.99276600000000004	0.23303552	0.22846780999999999	-0.0286	0.9803990999999999718	3419	3149	3377.3880000000004	3176.1561000000002	0.94041790000000003	1.2129006	1.1372852	-0.0929	0.9376573999999999719	2318	2382	2293.788	2403.4920999999999	1.0478266000000001	0.67469924000000003	0.67607607999999997	0.0029	1.002040720	2430	2134	2404.9698000000003	2154.8956000000003	0.89601770000000003	0.81359402000000003	0.67050481000000006	-0.2791	0.82412700000000005!sample_table_end
