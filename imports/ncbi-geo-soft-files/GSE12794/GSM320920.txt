Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320920/suppl/GSM320920.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	716	668	732.34379000000001	657.16496000000006	0.8973449	0.84756565000000006	0.80015985000000001	-0.0830	0.944068299999999972	869	780	893.70337000000006	761.56571000000008	0.85214599999999996	1.1015162999999999	0.96941389	-0.1843	0.880072199999999973	542	504	548.67201	505.76340000000005	0.92179549999999999	0.62374987000000004	0.57527170999999999	-0.1167	0.922279500000000034	6009	5145	6222.5924000000005	4829.1082999999999	0.77606050000000004	7.5665461999999994	5.6632151999999998	-0.4180	0.748454500000000025	3974	6338	4139.1358	5952.0565999999999	1.4379949999999999	3.9339244999999998	5.8314611999999997	0.5679	1.48235216	4629	5363	4813.4569000000001	5032.1686	1.0454375	6.0165208999999997	6.3424258	0.0761	1.05416829999999997	1183	1379	1228.2394000000002	1316.9265	1.0722067	0.85105496999999997	1.0195075999999998	0.2605	1.19793398	644	934	655.27936	903.25035000000003	1.3784202999999999	0.76599749000000006	0.99916008000000001	0.3834	1.30439089	1084	972	1122.9780000000001	939.35716000000002	0.8364876	1.3298226	1.1514892999999999	-0.2077	0.8658968999999999710	5897	6253	6108.8978000000006	5871.4137000000001	0.96112489999999995	5.4542069	4.8451455999999995	-0.1708	0.888331811	3287	3475	3421.7781	3274.8131000000003	0.95705010000000001	3.2620225	2.9899158999999997	-0.1257	0.916583512	3642	3234	3794.5083	3051.1139000000003	0.80408679999999999	3.5302745999999998	2.9423002999999999	-0.2628	0.8334479999999999713	1077	1225	1115.4626000000001	1176.5426	1.0547575	0.81159344	0.84094389999999997	0.0513	1.036163999999999914	2106	2125	2192.6232	2016.193	0.91953459999999998	2.6294111	2.5910517999999998	-0.0212	0.9854114000000000515	799	695	820.23385000000007	682.60970000000009	0.83221350000000005	0.77523078000000001	0.66371004	-0.2241	0.8561450999999999916	850	1101	873.79329000000007	1062.0715	1.2154723000000001	0.84922242000000003	1.0735859999999999	0.3382	1.264198817	196	192	169.506	216.67818000000003	1.2782921	0.20966139	0.27462639999999999	0.3894	1.309856799999999918	2328	2007	2423.6889000000001	1905.144	0.78605139999999996	1.5964406	1.4348847	-0.1539	0.898802419	453	412	452.64472000000006	420.25517000000002	0.92844380000000004	0.58454534000000002	0.56527512000000002	-0.0484	0.9670338000000000520	920	887	947.28457000000003	859.08508000000006	0.90689229999999998	1.1743611999999999	0.93143197	-0.3344	0.79313929999999999!sample_table_end
