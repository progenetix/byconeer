Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322764/suppl/GSM322764.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	565.44399999999996	639.60000000000002	588.77700000000004	612.50300000000004	1.0403	1.11822	1.13829	0.0257	1.01794999999999992	5541.3599999999997	6778.2399999999998	5947.3500000000004	6228.9099999999999	1.0473399999999999	7.5450999999999997	8.1139899999999994	0.1049	1.07539999999999993	151.34700000000001	132.036	150.423	136.69200000000001	0.90871800000000003	0.26496500000000001	0.25131700000000001	-0.0763	0.948489000000000034	6777	8070.29	7287.46	7409.6199999999999	1.0167600000000001	14.3672	14.553100000000001	0.0185	1.012945	233.58199999999999	196.578	237.21799999999999	197.096	0.83086300000000002	0.36113800000000001	0.31056	-0.2177	0.859948000000000056	160.84399999999999	209.791	160.405	209.523	1.3062100000000001	0.26840999999999998	0.36730699999999999	0.4525	1.36844999999999997	705.91600000000005	925.77300000000002	737.60799999999995	879.53700000000003	1.19242	1.3640300000000001	1.58721	0.2186	1.16362000000000018	448.04899999999998	565.26199999999994	464.19600000000003	542.82399999999996	1.1693899999999999	0.59853999999999996	0.72505399999999998	0.2766	1.21137000000000019	1570.5	1512.73	1656.1300000000001	1424.03	0.85985400000000001	2.7046399999999999	2.30619	-0.2299	0.8526810000000000210	182.34100000000001	155.685	182.922	158.95099999999999	0.86895199999999995	0.26261299999999999	0.222969	-0.2361	0.8490410000000000511	243.39099999999999	250.66200000000001	247.68700000000001	247.89599999999999	1.00084	0.42870999999999998	0.44053599999999998	0.0393	1.0275912	180.59999999999999	191.71199999999999	181.13800000000001	192.69900000000001	1.0638300000000001	0.33658700000000003	0.354576	0.0751	1.0534513	1504.24	1317.26	1585.8099999999999	1243.77	0.78431099999999998	2.77399	2.20391	-0.3319	0.7944909999999999514	1582.71	1609.74	1668.5999999999999	1513.49	0.90704300000000004	3.0724200000000002	2.8348800000000001	-0.1161	0.9226889999999999815	258	189.369	263.16199999999998	190.32599999999999	0.72322500000000001	0.73700500000000002	0.54016200000000003	-0.4483	0.7329160000000000116	1297.3199999999999	1251.27	1364.3399999999999	1182.3	0.86657300000000004	1.9207000000000001	1.7459499999999999	-0.1376	0.9090160000000000517	1582.71	1609.74	1668.5999999999999	1513.49	0.90704300000000004	3.0724200000000002	2.8348800000000001	-0.1161	0.9226889999999999818	1504.24	1317.26	1585.8099999999999	1243.77	0.78431099999999998	2.77399	2.20391	-0.3319	0.7944909999999999519	180.59999999999999	191.71199999999999	181.13800000000001	192.69900000000001	1.0638300000000001	0.33658700000000003	0.354576	0.0751	1.0534520	357.30700000000002	488.80399999999997	368.44600000000003	471.13400000000001	1.27871	0.96024299999999996	1.21753	0.3425	1.26793!sample_table_end
