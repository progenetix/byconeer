Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322800/suppl/GSM322800.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	301.72000000000003	240	296.05000000000001	247.84399999999999	0.83716800000000002	0.38817400000000002	0.33041500000000001	-0.2324	0.851203000000000042	3666.9099999999999	3289.5999999999999	3761.8400000000001	3144.5300000000002	0.83590200000000003	6.7796900000000004	5.8662299999999998	-0.2088	0.865264999999999953	286.44	259.84899999999999	280.69099999999997	267.58800000000002	0.953318	0.35686499999999999	0.36096800000000001	0.0165	1.01150000000000014	3814.1799999999998	3403.4899999999998	3913.6900000000001	3251.96	0.83091899999999996	5.8247099999999996	5.2593100000000002	-0.1473	0.902930000000000015	191.422	165.79599999999999	188.10900000000001	174.643	0.92840999999999996	0.31177300000000002	0.285136	-0.1288	0.914561999999999996	222.46199999999999	212.37799999999999	217.41800000000001	220.304	1.01328	0.36347400000000002	0.36534299999999997	0.0074	1.00513999999999997	549.30200000000002	627.14200000000005	547.45600000000002	624.43799999999999	1.14062	0.71479499999999996	0.82453900000000002	0.2061	1.15352999999999998	399.80399999999997	482.87099999999998	395.19900000000001	485.67899999999997	1.22895	0.716449	0.85388600000000003	0.2532	1.19182999999999999	1208.6600000000001	1229.03	1222.79	1200.8099999999999	0.98202400000000001	1.85528	1.7830900000000001	-0.0573	0.96108610	193.59	188.22300000000001	192.524	196.43100000000001	1.0202899999999999	0.28555799999999998	0.287576	0.0102	1.007069999999999911	146	119.70699999999999	148.95599999999999	131.827	0.88500699999999999	0.20635300000000001	0.18052699999999999	-0.1929	0.8748449999999999812	210.51400000000001	216.40700000000001	207.696	224.98500000000001	1.08324	0.26751999999999998	0.29489599999999999	0.1406	1.1023313	1174.6800000000001	955.83500000000004	1186.79	943.05899999999997	0.79463300000000003	1.7615000000000001	1.4001399999999999	-0.3312	0.7948579999999999514	2131.3699999999999	2132.1999999999998	2175.1599999999999	2055.6399999999999	0.94504999999999995	3.2882699999999998	3.1220699999999999	-0.0748	0.9494550000000000515	422.24400000000003	330.12400000000002	417.91899999999998	336.88200000000001	0.80609399999999998	0.63255600000000001	0.56224099999999999	-0.1700	0.8888399999999999616	541.86699999999996	574.64099999999996	540.19600000000003	574.51199999999994	1.0635300000000001	1.0312699999999999	1.0423500000000001	0.0154	1.0107517	2131.3699999999999	2132.1999999999998	2175.1599999999999	2055.6399999999999	0.94504999999999995	3.2882699999999998	3.1220699999999999	-0.0748	0.9494550000000000518	1174.6800000000001	955.83500000000004	1186.79	943.05899999999997	0.79463300000000003	1.7615000000000001	1.4001399999999999	-0.3312	0.7948579999999999519	210.51400000000001	216.40700000000001	207.696	224.98500000000001	1.08324	0.26751999999999998	0.29489599999999999	0.1406	1.1023320	567.22199999999998	513.19600000000003	565.87099999999998	514.91300000000001	0.90994699999999995	0.99201700000000004	1.00983	0.0257	1.01796!sample_table_end
