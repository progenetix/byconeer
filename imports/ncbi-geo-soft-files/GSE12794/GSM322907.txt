Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322907/suppl/GSM322907.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2275.2399999999998	1687.5599999999999	2273.3200000000002	1693.01	0.74473	1.3209299999999999	0.99449500000000002	-0.4095	0.752874999999999962	7741.7299999999996	8974.5599999999995	7914.0600000000004	8645.3999999999996	1.0924100000000001	5.8984100000000002	6.2962600000000002	0.0942	1.067453	482.791	412.50700000000001	472.346	427.55599999999998	0.90517599999999998	0.36619099999999999	0.327264	-0.1621	0.893696999999999964	8481.9899999999998	8620.9899999999998	8681.1100000000006	8310.2900000000009	0.957283	6.7070699999999999	6.4383699999999999	-0.0590	0.959937999999999965	625.22199999999998	628.41300000000001	612.88300000000004	644.48099999999999	1.0515600000000001	0.42515900000000001	0.44398599999999999	0.0625	1.04428000000000016	642.92399999999998	707.51099999999997	630.49300000000005	723.18799999999999	1.1470199999999999	0.44926300000000002	0.50478400000000001	0.1681	1.123587	4395.6700000000001	3211.5300000000002	4448.3400000000001	3170.3099999999999	0.712696	2.7033700000000001	1.9744699999999999	-0.4533	0.730373000000000058	3190.04	3193.3600000000001	3209.4899999999998	3152.8299999999999	0.98234699999999997	2.1959599999999999	2.0509300000000001	-0.0986	0.933956000000000019	5447.9899999999998	4397.1199999999999	5536.5900000000001	4305.2799999999997	0.77760499999999999	3.5722800000000001	2.8143500000000001	-0.3440	0.7878300000000000310	231.78899999999999	254.84399999999999	228.69300000000001	268.18400000000003	1.1726799999999999	0.15029300000000001	0.17641599999999999	0.2312	1.173820000000000111	1133.48	1041.8699999999999	1120.23	1056.23	0.94286700000000001	0.61999400000000005	0.58189599999999997	-0.0915	0.9385512	722.11599999999999	610.596	709.14099999999996	626.48199999999997	0.88343799999999995	0.431979	0.38961600000000002	-0.1489	0.9019319999999999613	4954.1800000000003	5116.8999999999996	5025.3100000000004	4990.5699999999997	0.99308700000000005	3.2184400000000002	3.19964	-0.0084	0.9941609999999999614	10337.700000000001	9492.5799999999999	10607.299999999999	9141.8600000000006	0.86184700000000003	7.5132000000000003	6.5637100000000004	-0.1949	0.8736230000000000415	1525.8299999999999	1470.6800000000001	1514.3099999999999	1479.4400000000001	0.97697500000000004	1.2718700000000001	1.2414799999999999	-0.0349	0.97610516	3205.2199999999998	3076.3299999999999	3224.6700000000001	3040.1199999999999	0.94276899999999997	2.3948100000000001	2.1626099999999999	-0.1471	0.9030390000000000417	10337.700000000001	9492.5799999999999	10607.299999999999	9141.8600000000006	0.86184700000000003	7.5132000000000003	6.5637100000000004	-0.1949	0.8736230000000000418	4954.1800000000003	5116.8999999999996	5025.3100000000004	4990.5699999999997	0.99308700000000005	3.2184400000000002	3.19964	-0.0084	0.9941609999999999619	722.11599999999999	610.596	709.14099999999996	626.48199999999997	0.88343799999999995	0.431979	0.38961600000000002	-0.1489	0.9019319999999999620	1499.71	1639.5	1487.98	1645.55	1.1059000000000001	1.40564	1.5550200000000001	0.1457	1.1062700000000001!sample_table_end
