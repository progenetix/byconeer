Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322900/suppl/GSM322900.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2660.5900000000001	2715.04	2717.8800000000001	2641.4200000000001	0.97186700000000004	1.59179	1.5294099999999999	-0.0577	0.960810000000000052	10449.5	11092.1	10580.799999999999	10747.299999999999	1.0157400000000001	6.4096200000000003	6.3961300000000003	-0.0030	0.997894999999999983	362.31099999999998	234.44399999999999	316.149	286.05799999999999	0.90482200000000002	0.193999	0.16647000000000001	-0.2208	0.858098000000000034	9440.0799999999999	10349.299999999999	9573.7700000000004	10020.200000000001	1.0466299999999999	4.9817	5.0786499999999997	0.0278	1.019465	442.57799999999997	375.38200000000001	400.21199999999999	418.06400000000002	1.04461	0.20505699999999999	0.217696	0.0863	1.06163000000000016	438.68900000000002	430.822	396.05900000000003	469.84199999999998	1.1862900000000001	0.24013699999999999	0.28416599999999997	0.2429	1.18334999999999997	4180.1999999999998	4581.8900000000003	4270.3800000000001	4436.0100000000002	1.0387900000000001	2.9659399999999998	2.9493299999999998	-0.0081	0.9943988	1383.96	1704.1800000000001	1397.8	1674.9000000000001	1.19824	0.76753099999999996	0.95607900000000001	0.3169	1.245669	3952.21	4142.5100000000002	4034.5799999999999	4017.0799999999999	0.99566200000000005	2.2472400000000001	2.24519	-0.0013	0.9990869999999999510	375.02300000000002	228.19900000000001	333.12	283.43000000000001	0.85083600000000004	0.22822500000000001	0.18831700000000001	-0.2773	0.8251370000000000111	607.178	738.61300000000006	577.34400000000005	758.69600000000003	1.31412	0.29281200000000002	0.38269999999999998	0.3862	1.3069812	428.29500000000002	440.50200000000001	384.93000000000001	478.86599999999999	1.24403	0.26530599999999999	0.31718200000000002	0.2577	1.1955313	3413.54	3529.5300000000002	3484.3200000000002	3431.0599999999999	0.98471399999999998	2.39249	2.30186	-0.0557	0.9621199999999999814	6016.9700000000003	6281.0600000000004	6128.8900000000003	6077.1400000000003	0.99155599999999999	4.2661300000000004	4.1626099999999999	-0.0354	0.9757350000000000215	641.11099999999999	530.89800000000002	613.71600000000001	562.59900000000005	0.91671100000000005	0.44509900000000002	0.38659399999999999	-0.2033	0.8685589999999999716	3713.4200000000001	3370.25	3794.54	3270.6199999999999	0.86192800000000003	2.1768900000000002	1.92499	-0.1774	0.8842870000000000517	6016.9700000000003	6281.0600000000004	6128.8900000000003	6077.1400000000003	0.99155599999999999	4.2661300000000004	4.1626099999999999	-0.0354	0.9757350000000000218	3413.54	3529.5300000000002	3484.3200000000002	3431.0599999999999	0.98471399999999998	2.39249	2.30186	-0.0557	0.9621199999999999819	428.29500000000002	440.50200000000001	384.93000000000001	478.86599999999999	1.24403	0.26530599999999999	0.31718200000000002	0.2577	1.1955320	1767.53	2282.4400000000001	1796.6400000000001	2228.0999999999999	1.2401500000000001	1.84781	2.1335899999999999	0.2075	1.15466!sample_table_end
