Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322816/suppl/GSM322816.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	827.36000000000001	805.10199999999998	797.43299999999999	829.36800000000005	1.0400499999999999	1.15066	1.2231799999999999	0.0882	1.06302000000000012	8083.1300000000001	8111.2399999999998	8099.3900000000003	7862.8699999999999	0.97079800000000005	10.0158	9.0782500000000006	-0.1418	0.906395999999999983	362.88400000000001	229.00899999999999	337.726	254.40000000000001	0.75327500000000003	0.39058300000000001	0.31850699999999998	-0.2943	0.815466000000000024	10166.6	9124	10245.1	8841.1200000000008	0.86296200000000001	11.686999999999999	10.938599999999999	-0.0955	0.935961999999999965	316.89800000000002	239.35599999999999	292.77800000000002	264.88200000000001	0.904721	0.36920500000000001	0.33565499999999998	-0.1374	0.909128999999999966	295.80000000000001	216.27099999999999	272.31999999999999	241.43600000000001	0.88659200000000005	0.34342600000000001	0.320996	-0.0974	0.934686000000000027	1024.1900000000001	976.42200000000003	992.01400000000001	997.37599999999998	1.0054099999999999	1.78765	1.82226	0.0277	1.019368	625.79100000000005	542.86699999999996	597.58799999999997	569.51400000000001	0.95302200000000004	0.67402600000000001	0.63363000000000003	-0.0892	0.940068000000000019	2249.8099999999999	1812.29	2214.0799999999999	1813.45	0.81905399999999995	3.3803899999999998	2.6958700000000002	-0.3264	0.7975039999999999910	185.97800000000001	158.196	165.352	181.904	1.1001000000000001	0.223441	0.23547699999999999	0.0757	1.053870000000000111	760.93299999999999	418.32900000000001	731.37400000000002	445.73000000000002	0.60944200000000004	0.84339399999999998	0.54632599999999998	-0.6264	0.6477709999999999912	234.953	159.637	212.43299999999999	183.77799999999999	0.86510900000000002	0.344829	0.30885200000000002	-0.1590	0.8956680000000000213	2543.4899999999998	1946.4000000000001	2509.71	1940.8699999999999	0.77334499999999995	3.4745200000000001	2.7913000000000001	-0.3159	0.8033639999999999714	1615.1400000000001	1657.3499999999999	1580.26	1660.8599999999999	1.05101	2.3753700000000002	2.5692599999999999	0.1132	1.081630000000000115	421.44400000000002	391.85300000000001	395.58300000000003	418.983	1.05915	0.52667799999999998	0.60213700000000003	0.1932	1.1432716	1014.5700000000001	786.68899999999996	982.58399999999995	811.27099999999996	0.82565100000000002	1.20167	1.0129300000000001	-0.2465	0.8429360000000000217	1615.1400000000001	1657.3499999999999	1580.26	1660.8599999999999	1.05101	2.3753700000000002	2.5692599999999999	0.1132	1.081630000000000118	2543.4899999999998	1946.4000000000001	2509.71	1940.8699999999999	0.77334499999999995	3.4745200000000001	2.7913000000000001	-0.3159	0.8033639999999999719	234.953	159.637	212.43299999999999	183.77799999999999	0.86510900000000002	0.344829	0.30885200000000002	-0.1590	0.8956680000000000220	787.22699999999998	859.04399999999998	757.56299999999999	882.471	1.1648799999999999	1.1413599999999999	1.42449	0.3197	1.24807!sample_table_end
