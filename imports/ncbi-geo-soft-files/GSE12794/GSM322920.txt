Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322920/suppl/GSM322920.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	827.476	867.12	854.23299999999995	840.31399999999996	0.98370500000000005	0.780389	0.77494600000000002	-0.0101	0.993025000000000052	13188.5	13083.4	13511.9	12661.4	0.93706	10.266400000000001	9.4498899999999999	-0.1196	0.920471999999999963	337.35599999999999	329.60000000000002	350.63999999999999	320.96199999999999	0.91536099999999998	0.229766	0.210281	-0.1278	0.915194999999999984	21382	21273.900000000001	21502.599999999999	20950.200000000001	0.97431000000000001	15.2012	14.898	-0.0291	0.980049999999999985	308.60399999999998	348.32900000000001	321.36900000000003	339.09399999999999	1.05515	0.24487100000000001	0.25385000000000002	0.0520	1.036676	600.31100000000004	637.48000000000002	620.05499999999995	619.33399999999995	0.99883699999999997	0.48568800000000001	0.50248999999999999	0.0491	1.03458999999999997	1419.8199999999999	1295.02	1469.03	1249.76	0.85073699999999997	1.4905299999999999	1.2889600000000001	-0.2096	0.864762999999999958	825.67999999999995	1017.12	852.37300000000005	984.37800000000004	1.1548700000000001	0.67130400000000001	0.77346599999999999	0.2044	1.152189	1496.5	1559.05	1550.99	1500.01	0.96713099999999996	1.3572299999999999	1.32978	-0.0295	0.9797749999999999510	275.34899999999999	291.83199999999999	287.93099999999998	283.94799999999998	0.98616499999999996	0.25433299999999998	0.24840999999999999	-0.0340	0.9767130000000000511	619.15599999999995	663.12900000000002	639.5	644.072	1.00715	0.51641499999999996	0.52352200000000004	0.0197	1.0137612	302.46800000000002	360.20999999999998	315.18599999999998	350.69999999999999	1.1126799999999999	0.30007099999999998	0.33704499999999998	0.1676	1.1232113	2466.5100000000002	2435.9299999999998	2564.4099999999999	2330.7199999999998	0.90887200000000001	2.19042	2.0226500000000001	-0.1150	0.9234050000000000314	2836.0900000000001	3003.98	2949.1199999999999	2873.1799999999998	0.97424999999999995	2.61592	2.5700699999999999	-0.0255	0.9824699999999999515	1199.03	1178.5	1239.0799999999999	1138.8399999999999	0.919103	0.91126499999999999	0.82597900000000002	-0.1418	0.9064090000000000216	1277.73	1506.3499999999999	1320.96	1450.5899999999999	1.0981300000000001	1.12948	1.22373	0.1156	1.0834417	2836.0900000000001	3003.98	2949.1199999999999	2873.1799999999998	0.97424999999999995	2.61592	2.5700699999999999	-0.0255	0.9824699999999999518	2466.5100000000002	2435.9299999999998	2564.4099999999999	2330.7199999999998	0.90887200000000001	2.19042	2.0226500000000001	-0.1150	0.9234050000000000319	302.46800000000002	360.20999999999998	315.18599999999998	350.69999999999999	1.1126799999999999	0.30007099999999998	0.33704499999999998	0.1676	1.1232120	2243.7600000000002	2789.2199999999998	2331.46	2662.6399999999999	1.14205	1.88252	2.0922800000000001	0.1524	1.1114299999999999!sample_table_end
