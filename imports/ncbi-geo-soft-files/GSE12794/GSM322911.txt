Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322911/suppl/GSM322911.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	430.57799999999997	579.15599999999995	466.97800000000001	546.928	1.1712100000000001	0.337252	0.38620500000000002	0.1955	1.14514999999999992	5465.3999999999996	6071.0699999999997	5307.4899999999998	6175.1400000000003	1.1634800000000001	4.6871299999999998	5.5555099999999999	0.2452	1.185273	512.24400000000003	446.75999999999999	545.60500000000002	407.16199999999998	0.74625900000000001	0.417659	0.32866000000000001	-0.3457	0.786911000000000034	6293.3999999999996	5859.2399999999998	6103.6599999999999	5959.2299999999996	0.97633700000000001	4.4314400000000003	4.6717599999999999	0.0762	1.054235	375.29300000000001	449.66699999999997	413.99200000000002	410.24200000000002	0.99094099999999996	0.31005300000000002	0.32031500000000002	0.0470	1.03309000000000016	334	293.62200000000001	374.41500000000002	244.983	0.65430900000000003	0.29655199999999998	0.20231499999999999	-0.5517	0.6822267	3406.9000000000001	3300.4099999999999	3329.3800000000001	3352.3899999999999	1.00691	2.4413999999999998	2.3918699999999999	-0.0296	0.9797118	5780.46	4656.3800000000001	5609.8800000000001	4731.75	0.84346699999999997	4.1599000000000004	3.5110100000000002	-0.2447	0.844014000000000049	4331.8299999999999	4273.5900000000001	4234.9099999999999	4321.5	1.0204500000000001	3.0854300000000001	3.1222500000000002	0.0171	1.0119310	155.613	290.988	207.16200000000001	247.01900000000001	1.1923900000000001	0.149253	0.17957500000000001	0.2668	1.203149999999999911	70.111000000000004	193.46700000000001	115.581	153.72800000000001	1.33005	0.074278899999999995	0.099606299999999995	0.4233	1.340980000000000112	770.18600000000004	791.48299999999995	794.16200000000003	767.86699999999996	0.96689000000000003	0.55145	0.52442299999999997	-0.0725	0.9509889999999999713	7666.0100000000002	7189.1499999999996	7444.6199999999999	7287.1199999999999	0.97884300000000002	5.6314200000000003	5.5210499999999998	-0.0286	0.9804000000000000514	20377.900000000001	17496	19689.299999999999	17555.599999999999	0.891629	14.8713	13.4717	-0.1426	0.90588715	305.11099999999999	485.34199999999998	346.70100000000002	447.90199999999999	1.2919	0.28775000000000001	0.38400400000000001	0.4163	1.334510000000000116	2364.0300000000002	2019	2327.2600000000002	2036.1400000000001	0.87490900000000005	1.8571	1.66574	-0.1569	0.8969580000000000317	20377.900000000001	17496	19689.299999999999	17555.599999999999	0.891629	14.8713	13.4717	-0.1426	0.90588718	7666.0100000000002	7189.1499999999996	7444.6199999999999	7287.1199999999999	0.97884300000000002	5.6314200000000003	5.5210499999999998	-0.0286	0.9804000000000000519	770.18600000000004	791.48299999999995	794.16200000000003	767.86699999999996	0.96689000000000003	0.55145	0.52442299999999997	-0.0725	0.9509889999999999720	2433.5300000000002	2210.52	2393.71	2234.6999999999998	0.93357199999999996	1.88916	1.83338	-0.0432	0.97047399999999995!sample_table_end
