Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320918/suppl/GSM320918.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	616	656	636.74266	638.94560000000001	1.0034597000000001	0.86541796999999998	0.79294412000000003	-0.1262	0.916255700000000012	842	821	863.78338000000008	801.92153000000008	0.92838270000000001	1.1365581	0.98738228000000006	-0.2030	0.868747700000000013	742	752	763.94510000000002	734.18223	0.96104060000000002	0.66844239000000005	0.62191181000000006	-0.1041	0.930389499999999984	3294	3155	3347.8499000000002	3080.2245000000003	0.92006049999999995	4.0566860999999994	3.5185719	-0.2053	0.867351300000000055	7420	9639	7446.7862000000005	9466.4566000000013	1.2712136999999999	4.2328282000000002	5.7676977999999997	0.4464	1.36261096	3743	3976	3796.1878000000002	3877.2827000000002	1.0213622	3.0618768999999997	3.1622664	0.0465	1.03278690000000017	1220	1424	1242.8277	1394.2027	1.1217988000000001	0.86217595999999996	1.0593759	0.2972	1.22872349999999998	1025	1109	1046.7416000000001	1083.9686000000002	1.0355646999999999	0.78069566000000001	0.80986460999999998	0.0529	1.03736279999999999	995	1069	1016.6534	1045.8779	1.0287457	1.1010154999999999	1.0839665999999999	-0.0225	0.9845152999999999810	4418	5073	4466.8766000000005	4956.5622000000003	1.109626	3.2225058999999998	3.5712397	0.1482	1.108218211	6731	6900	6763.5844999999999	6755.2752	0.99877150000000003	4.9522021999999994	5.0076466000000002	0.0161	1.011195899999999912	1766	1988	1797.9920000000002	1942.575	1.0804136	2.3574634999999997	2.4257971	0.0412	1.028986113	1038	1385	1059.6874	1355.8876	1.2795166	0.94437437000000002	1.2013932999999999	0.3473	1.272157899999999814	4401	4340	4450.0178000000005	4234.3921	0.95154499999999997	3.0709369	2.9903530999999997	-0.0384	0.9737592000000000515	1052	1215	1073.6244000000002	1186.4648	1.1051023	0.88811691000000004	0.97170478999999998	0.1298	1.094118116	501	883	521.77078000000006	862.65597000000002	1.6533236	0.64547009	1.029317	0.6733	1.594678099999999917	240	329	251.25618000000003	319.0111	1.2696647000000001	0.34479385000000001	0.40263425000000003	0.2237	1.167753599999999918	2716	2477	2758.8751999999999	2419.2757999999999	0.87690659999999998	1.5181004999999999	1.3929126999999999	-0.1242	0.9175366000000000419	687	840	708.26886000000002	820.51511000000005	1.1584797	0.63546977999999998	0.72824082000000001	0.1966	1.145988099999999820	724	731	745.78019000000006	713.31996000000004	0.95647479999999996	0.60575436999999999	0.54915433000000002	-0.1415	0.90656270000000005!sample_table_end
