Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322784/suppl/GSM322784.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	867.28899999999999	803.51999999999998	838.76300000000003	829.39599999999996	0.98883200000000004	0.88294300000000003	0.90022400000000002	0.0280	1.01957000000000012	4073.71	4741.3199999999997	4068.98	4654.1700000000001	1.1438200000000001	6.0264199999999999	6.8644999999999996	0.1879	1.139073	220.68899999999999	152.578	199.88900000000001	175.959	0.88028099999999998	0.22797799999999999	0.215054	-0.0842	0.943309999999999984	12206.200000000001	12489.6	12312.799999999999	12231.9	0.99342200000000003	13.9536	15.2476	0.1279	1.092735	233.49299999999999	170.43600000000001	212.32599999999999	194.06100000000001	0.91397700000000004	0.25675199999999998	0.247251	-0.0544	0.962994000000000026	242.089	185.05799999999999	220.69300000000001	208.83699999999999	0.94627499999999998	0.26686199999999999	0.262042	-0.0263	0.981940999999999957	1635.47	1534.8399999999999	1602.6500000000001	1552.3199999999999	0.96859600000000001	1.6842600000000001	1.68923	0.0042	1.002958	455.44	486.80399999999997	431.37599999999998	512.74699999999996	1.1886300000000001	0.59169000000000005	0.68038399999999999	0.2015	1.14989999999999999	1697.9300000000001	1544.48	1664.8099999999999	1562.05	0.93827400000000005	1.9328799999999999	1.8173699999999999	-0.0889	0.9402350000000000410	195.99000000000001	117.663	175.989	140.42500000000001	0.79791800000000002	0.216336	0.16472300000000001	-0.3932	0.7614220000000000411	145.20400000000001	86.173000000000002	127.845	107.303	0.83932700000000005	0.12784100000000001	0.10830099999999999	-0.2393	0.8471579999999999712	259.90899999999999	257.06400000000002	238.065	281.52600000000001	1.1825600000000001	0.25787100000000002	0.30896400000000002	0.2608	1.198129999999999913	4024.6500000000001	2877.6599999999999	4010.73	2863.9099999999999	0.71406099999999995	4.4062900000000003	3.2151100000000001	-0.4547	0.7296639999999999814	4984.4200000000001	4267.5299999999997	4993.3599999999997	4201.1000000000004	0.84133599999999997	5.9649900000000002	5.1322200000000002	-0.2169	0.8603910000000000215	1118.8699999999999	1065.9300000000001	1088.0899999999999	1090.4100000000001	1.00213	1.40021	1.5620499999999999	0.1578	1.1155816	1522.76	1574.54	1490.04	1591.3699999999999	1.0680000000000001	2.11314	2.2105399999999999	0.0650	1.0460917	4984.4200000000001	4267.5299999999997	4993.3599999999997	4201.1000000000004	0.84133599999999997	5.9649900000000002	5.1322200000000002	-0.2169	0.8603910000000000218	4024.6500000000001	2877.6599999999999	4010.73	2863.9099999999999	0.71406099999999995	4.4062900000000003	3.2151100000000001	-0.4547	0.7296639999999999819	259.90899999999999	257.06400000000002	238.065	281.52600000000001	1.1825600000000001	0.25787100000000002	0.30896400000000002	0.2608	1.198129999999999920	1175.49	1040.04	1144.1300000000001	1064.9100000000001	0.93075699999999995	1.6360600000000001	1.61582	-0.0180	0.98762799999999995!sample_table_end
