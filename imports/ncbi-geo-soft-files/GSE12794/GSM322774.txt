Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322774/suppl/GSM322774.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	455.53300000000002	452.37799999999999	475.274	435.43200000000002	0.91617000000000004	0.93764400000000003	0.85480500000000004	-0.1334	0.911653000000000052	4126.1800000000003	6115.1099999999997	4652.7299999999996	5341.6499999999996	1.1480699999999999	7.72295	8.4317299999999999	0.1267	1.091783	179.05799999999999	150.74700000000001	177.97	155.708	0.87491300000000005	0.27773700000000001	0.26851399999999997	-0.0487	0.966790000000000044	9113.0699999999997	11540.299999999999	10310.200000000001	10093.5	0.97897400000000001	17.110199999999999	17.386900000000001	0.0231	1.016175	141.71600000000001	143.733	139.18199999999999	149.04400000000001	1.0708599999999999	0.24982199999999999	0.26279000000000002	0.0730	1.05190999999999996	169.31999999999999	165.75999999999999	167.791	169.91	1.0126299999999999	0.36493799999999998	0.37518099999999999	0.0399	1.028077	559.15599999999995	668.41800000000001	588.11599999999999	631.13599999999997	1.07315	1.13348	1.212	0.0966	1.06926999999999998	460.702	586.053	480.84699999999998	556.71500000000003	1.15778	0.85406499999999996	0.95549799999999996	0.1619	1.118769	1188.8599999999999	1281.3399999999999	1289.54	1173.78	0.91023200000000004	2.2366299999999999	2.0216099999999999	-0.1458	0.9038620000000000510	140.29499999999999	148.376	137.83500000000001	153.47	1.1134299999999999	0.22682099999999999	0.24510999999999999	0.1119	1.0806311	83.466999999999999	65.516000000000005	81.342299999999994	73.123900000000006	0.89896500000000001	0.16180900000000001	0.15071399999999999	-0.1025	0.9314350000000000112	149.36600000000001	155.518	147.11699999999999	160.23099999999999	1.08914	0.28507300000000002	0.31656499999999999	0.1512	1.110470000000000113	1349.03	1429.8099999999999	1470.4300000000001	1303.1800000000001	0.88625600000000004	2.8854099999999998	2.6130200000000001	-0.1431	0.9055980000000000114	1858.4100000000001	2081.5900000000001	2048.6700000000001	1868.8499999999999	0.91222899999999996	3.8031299999999999	3.5887799999999999	-0.0837	0.9436390000000000115	830.178	808.42200000000003	887.48900000000003	756.50699999999995	0.85241299999999998	1.4525399999999999	1.3436300000000001	-0.1124	0.9250209999999999816	553.25800000000004	701.67100000000005	582.15700000000004	660.87199999999996	1.1352100000000001	1.20139	1.2902899999999999	0.1030	1.074000000000000117	1858.4100000000001	2081.5900000000001	2048.6700000000001	1868.8499999999999	0.91222899999999996	3.8031299999999999	3.5887799999999999	-0.0837	0.9436390000000000118	1349.03	1429.8099999999999	1470.4300000000001	1303.1800000000001	0.88625600000000004	2.8854099999999998	2.6130200000000001	-0.1431	0.9055980000000000119	149.36600000000001	155.518	147.11699999999999	160.23099999999999	1.08914	0.28507300000000002	0.31656499999999999	0.1512	1.110470000000000120	666	806.44399999999996	706.24400000000003	754.755	1.0686899999999999	1.2941499999999999	1.4553	0.1693	1.12452!sample_table_end
