Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320936/suppl/GSM320936.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2079	1895	2080.1224000000002	1893.8953000000001	0.91047299999999998	0.67750197000000001	0.60671503999999998	-0.1592	0.895517800000000032	4378	4792	4395.1210000000001	4740.4494000000004	1.0785708000000001	1.4485755	1.5247814	0.0740	1.05260749999999993	1411	1317	1406.9196000000002	1332.4367	0.9470596	0.49947172000000001	0.49237797	-0.0206	0.985797499999999994	12211	10560	12277.195	10344.362000000001	0.84256719999999996	4.5296135	3.9446109999999996	-0.1995	0.87084945	13617	15480	13687.948	15119.321	1.1045718	5.2139587999999994	6.1522670000000002	0.2387	1.17996079999999996	7728	7634	7764.8185000000003	7505.0918000000001	0.96655080000000004	2.8737649999999997	2.9265287999999998	0.0262	1.01836057	1926	2312	1924.1841000000002	2305.0583000000001	1.1979407	0.89233528000000006	1.1397257999999999	0.3530	1.27723948	1822	2122	1821.0209	2118.5826000000002	1.1634038	0.69666705000000007	0.82421622999999999	0.2426	1.18308489	3649	4162	3664.6833000000001	4125.5987000000005	1.1257721999999999	1.0963748	1.2054373	0.1368	1.099475510	8742	9119	8778.6183000000001	8946.6403000000009	1.0191399000000001	3.7273204999999998	3.6975463	-0.0116	0.9920119000000000611	12523	13257	12589.657000000001	12960.428	1.0294504	5.3534934999999999	5.4987312999999993	0.0386	1.027129512	4664	3704	4680.1484	3670.1989000000003	0.78420570000000001	2.3303536999999999	1.8729929999999999	-0.3152	0.8037376000000000513	1355	1363	1350.3272000000002	1377.3882000000001	1.0200403	0.82354846999999998	0.79944252999999998	-0.0429	0.9707292000000000714	11005	11107	11058.325000000001	10875.695	0.98348480000000005	3.6785934999999998	3.4845919999999997	-0.0782	0.9472620000000000515	1890	1735	1888.4783	1737.9750000000001	0.92030449999999997	0.83777827999999999	0.77175578	-0.1184	0.9211934000000000516	2125	2280	2127.6384000000003	2273.8559	1.0687229	0.98643031000000003	1.1081989999999999	0.1679	1.123443817	571	552	565.06661000000008	579.78539000000001	1.0260479	0.18456533	0.18536526	0.0062	1.004334218	3876	3025	3893.8243000000002	3002.0610000000001	0.77098009999999995	1.2147615999999999	1.0603437	-0.1961	0.8728820999999999919	1876	1814	1874.5917000000002	1814.7277000000001	0.96806559999999997	0.60643166999999998	0.56165224000000002	-0.1107	0.9261592000000000720	1989	1596	1988.0958000000001	1603.5227	0.80656209999999995	0.70760617000000003	0.64484847000000001	-0.1340	0.91130980000000006!sample_table_end
