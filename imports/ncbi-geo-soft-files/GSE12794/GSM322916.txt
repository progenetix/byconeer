Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322916/suppl/GSM322916.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1912.26	2469.4299999999998	2195.96	2138.04	0.97362499999999996	2.0582600000000002	2.07342	0.0106	1.00737000000000012	6194.1300000000001	7962.8699999999999	7038.6999999999998	6901.6899999999996	0.98053500000000005	6.7686299999999999	7.0265500000000003	0.0539	1.03813	173.21799999999999	217.56899999999999	186.16300000000001	204.33799999999999	1.0976300000000001	0.175178	0.18348700000000001	0.0669	1.04743000000000014	10299.200000000001	12375.700000000001	11488.6	10893.700000000001	0.94821599999999995	10.920400000000001	10.0418	-0.1210	0.9195435	478.11099999999999	570.22199999999998	536.38999999999999	511.22500000000002	0.95308400000000004	0.51067200000000001	0.47216399999999997	-0.1131	0.924594000000000036	328.142	405.27100000000002	363.74299999999999	368.10599999999999	1.0119899999999999	0.39590900000000001	0.39276699999999998	-0.0115	0.992064999999999977	3728.5700000000002	4002.5	4281.04	3444.8200000000002	0.80466800000000005	3.8605800000000001	3.2964600000000002	-0.2279	0.8538778	808.44899999999996	1212.5599999999999	918.13300000000004	1064.8399999999999	1.1597900000000001	1.0587899999999999	1.17241	0.1470	1.10739	3050.6500000000001	3740.46	3506.73	3221.8000000000002	0.91874900000000004	3.21515	3.1186600000000002	-0.0440	0.9699889999999999910	112.71299999999999	117.66800000000001	119.63	115.336	0.96410799999999997	0.107528	0.107486	-0.0006	0.9996169999999999811	413.66699999999997	566.66700000000003	462.55900000000003	508.16399999999999	1.09859	0.4965	0.54739000000000004	0.1408	1.102512	429.74799999999999	480.02699999999999	480.86500000000001	433.18700000000001	0.90084900000000001	0.454841	0.44376599999999999	-0.0356	0.9756510000000000513	4372.6599999999999	4758.3599999999997	4990.6899999999996	4125.21	0.82657999999999998	4.9340000000000002	4.0941099999999997	-0.2692	0.8297750000000000414	4302.9300000000003	5864.7299999999996	4912.8900000000003	5081.9300000000003	1.0344100000000001	4.6902400000000002	4.9800700000000004	0.0865	1.0617915	1103.24	1332.02	1258.75	1167.1700000000001	0.92724300000000004	1.18045	1.02583	-0.2025	0.8690170000000000416	1437.99	2054.4899999999998	1646.02	1785.05	1.08446	1.8072600000000001	1.90144	0.0733	1.052110000000000117	4302.9300000000003	5864.7299999999996	4912.8900000000003	5081.9300000000003	1.0344100000000001	4.6902400000000002	4.9800700000000004	0.0865	1.0617918	4372.6599999999999	4758.3599999999997	4990.6899999999996	4125.21	0.82657999999999998	4.9340000000000002	4.0941099999999997	-0.2692	0.8297750000000000419	429.74799999999999	480.02699999999999	480.86500000000001	433.18700000000001	0.90084900000000001	0.454841	0.44376599999999999	-0.0356	0.9756510000000000520	2220.0799999999999	3422.6700000000001	2551.6399999999999	2949.0900000000001	1.1557599999999999	2.53851	2.6108099999999999	0.0405	1.0284800000000001!sample_table_end
