Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322909/suppl/GSM322909.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1460.04	1299.9000000000001	1416.6700000000001	1340.05	0.94591999999999998	0.77573800000000004	0.73479000000000005	-0.0782	0.9472142	3621.77	4536.9499999999998	3567.96	4559.4700000000003	1.27789	2.5382400000000001	3.1417600000000001	0.3077	1.237773	644.75599999999997	578.39999999999998	614.36099999999999	610.75300000000004	0.99412599999999995	0.431259	0.42236099999999999	-0.0301	0.979369000000000054	4290.0900000000001	5451.3299999999999	4235.5600000000004	5463.46	1.2899	2.9033699999999998	3.6688900000000002	0.3376	1.26367000000000015	471.69799999999998	481.12	446.48599999999999	512.43399999999997	1.1476999999999999	0.266231	0.30797400000000003	0.2101	1.156796	490.63600000000002	484.86700000000002	464.70699999999999	516.22500000000002	1.11086	0.274982	0.30516700000000002	0.1503	1.10976999999999997	3031.9299999999998	3055.3800000000001	2978.4200000000001	3094.1300000000001	1.0388500000000001	1.66727	1.83708	0.1399	1.101858	3570.29	3506.7199999999998	3516.48	3541.9200000000001	1.0072300000000001	2.2299799999999999	2.2228599999999998	-0.0046	0.9968079	4420.3500000000004	4045.3600000000001	4364.9700000000003	4075.2399999999998	0.93362400000000001	2.51674	2.3592300000000002	-0.0932	0.9374139999999999710	372.483	265.23500000000001	352.09399999999999	294.94400000000002	0.83768399999999998	0.206313	0.17665500000000001	-0.2239	0.8562459999999999511	792.63999999999999	722.39999999999998	759.41899999999998	757.05600000000004	0.996888	0.40191399999999999	0.39687899999999998	-0.0182	0.9874720000000000212	779.98500000000001	668.84900000000005	746.56899999999996	703.20799999999997	0.94192100000000001	0.41997600000000002	0.41448499999999999	-0.0190	0.9869259999999999713	6284.8199999999997	6192.3500000000004	6225.5100000000002	6196.9300000000003	0.99540899999999999	3.5065499999999998	3.6021800000000002	0.0388	1.027269999999999914	11371.700000000001	11087.9	11275.6	11074.1	0.98212600000000005	7.1090999999999998	7.0853799999999998	-0.0048	0.9966639999999999915	1277.6199999999999	1235.3800000000001	1237.22	1275.05	1.0305800000000001	1.02597	1.0144200000000001	-0.0163	0.9887350000000000316	3136.3899999999999	3146.5100000000002	3081.73	3185.0300000000002	1.03352	2.02799	2.0260799999999999	-0.0014	0.9990560000000000617	11371.700000000001	11087.9	11275.6	11074.1	0.98212600000000005	7.1090999999999998	7.0853799999999998	-0.0048	0.9966639999999999918	6284.8199999999997	6192.3500000000004	6225.5100000000002	6196.9300000000003	0.99540899999999999	3.5065499999999998	3.6021800000000002	0.0388	1.027269999999999919	779.98500000000001	668.84900000000005	746.56899999999996	703.20799999999997	0.94192100000000001	0.41997600000000002	0.41448499999999999	-0.0190	0.9869259999999999720	1616.5599999999999	1716.8900000000001	1571.6400000000001	1759.26	1.11938	1.4040699999999999	1.5223500000000001	0.1167	1.0842400000000001!sample_table_end
