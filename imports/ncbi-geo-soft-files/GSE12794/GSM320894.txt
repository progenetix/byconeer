Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320894/suppl/GSM320894.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1733	1704	1770.6038000000001	1660.6267	0.93788729999999998	0.97359892000000003	0.91804600999999997	-0.0848	0.942940699999999972	2111	2180	2148.0446000000002	2122.4432000000002	0.98808149999999995	1.2709039	1.2112661999999998	-0.0693	0.953074599999999993	1150	1290	1183.8833	1256.3672000000001	1.0612254999999999	0.57079829999999998	0.64115957000000001	0.1677	1.12326824	9750	8151	9465.3101999999999	8142.335	0.86022909999999997	4.5652431	4.1653171999999996	-0.1323	0.912397699999999985	15991	16963	15218.922	17280.397000000001	1.1354548	7.6459931999999995	9.3103195999999997	0.2841	1.2176736	5257	4744	5225.4364000000005	4678.0911999999998	0.89525370000000004	2.6663231000000001	2.5098965999999998	-0.0872	0.941332500000000027	1439	1556	1476.2816	1516.9473	1.0275460999999999	0.84051240999999999	0.94465138000000004	0.1685	1.12389948	2078	2078	2115.7842000000001	2024.3515	0.95678549999999996	1.0365295999999999	1.016966	-0.0275	0.98112599	2621	2579	2657.1332000000002	2518.1307000000002	0.94768699999999995	1.4396860999999999	1.3140844	-0.1317	0.9127576000000000610	4488	5189	4487.7093000000004	5126.9189999999999	1.1424356	2.7060651999999998	2.9525874999999999	0.1258	1.091099899999999911	7585	6992	7436.6801000000005	6958.6724000000004	0.93572299999999997	4.2603514000000002	3.9361755999999999	-0.1142	0.9239087000000000312	3906	4016	3920.3166000000001	3944.0278000000003	1.0060483	2.2166223999999999	2.4007739999999997	0.1151	1.083077499999999913	1196	1515	1229.7467000000001	1477.1871000000001	1.2012125	0.80504224000000002	0.92699255000000003	0.2035	1.151483099999999914	8858	8309	8633.1687000000002	8305.5257000000001	0.96204840000000003	5.0836264999999994	4.6216553999999999	-0.1374	0.9091257000000000415	1512	1567	1549.6179	1527.5748000000001	0.98577510000000002	0.76988873000000002	0.79233343000000001	0.0415	1.029153199999999916	1039	1392	1072.0227	1356.8410000000001	1.2656829999999999	0.58622556000000003	0.81209562000000002	0.4702	1.385295517	411	486	428.75490000000002	483.34299000000004	1.1273177000000001	0.26859236000000003	0.29498647	0.1352	1.098268318	2482	2602	2518.9882000000002	2541.2580000000003	1.0088408	1.2254771	1.2655494	0.0464	1.032699419	817	897	849.24326000000008	876.49030000000005	1.0320838999999999	0.57163514000000004	0.56957690000000005	-0.0052	0.9963994000000000520	1071	1176	1104.3607	1145.0448000000001	1.0368394999999999	0.74309831000000004	0.68044353000000002	-0.1271	0.91568440000000006!sample_table_end
