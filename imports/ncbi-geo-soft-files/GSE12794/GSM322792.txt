Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322792/suppl/GSM322792.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	243.62200000000001	173.68000000000001	229.411	187.934	0.81920300000000001	0.44889099999999998	0.34820400000000001	-0.3664	0.775699000000000032	2359.98	2542.7399999999998	2302.02	2539.29	1.10307	6.0360899999999997	6.80307	0.1726	1.127073	197.249	133	184.209	146.82400000000001	0.79705099999999995	0.30291299999999999	0.253077	-0.2593	0.835477000000000034	5546.6700000000001	4990.4799999999996	5440.1700000000001	4941.6599999999999	0.90836499999999998	8.9953099999999999	8.6581200000000003	-0.0551	0.962515000000000015	186.23599999999999	115.449	173.56899999999999	129.672	0.74709099999999995	0.32648300000000002	0.25768999999999997	-0.3414	0.789290999999999966	168.404	130.578	156.72900000000001	144.404	0.92136099999999999	0.38894899999999999	0.338505	-0.2004	0.870307000000000057	743.58199999999999	1114.2	717.76400000000001	1134.28	1.58029	1.1641999999999999	1.72984	0.5713	1.485868	433.87599999999998	492.54700000000003	415.267	511.44299999999998	1.2316	0.86437600000000003	1.02397	0.2444	1.18463000000000019	988.06100000000004	914.78599999999994	955.37300000000005	934.90700000000004	0.97857799999999995	1.95865	1.8417600000000001	-0.0888	0.9403209999999999610	147.56	142.75299999999999	138.029	156.619	1.1346799999999999	0.26033800000000001	0.28465400000000002	0.1288	1.093399999999999911	129.35599999999999	87.510999999999996	122.371	103.274	0.84394100000000005	0.28361999999999998	0.239621	-0.2432	0.8448660000000000112	210.91999999999999	169.06200000000001	197.524	183.37799999999999	0.92838699999999996	0.33361299999999999	0.31042599999999998	-0.1039	0.9304989999999999713	1343.5	1025.9100000000001	1303.6099999999999	1046.71	0.80293400000000004	2.5774300000000001	2.0727199999999999	-0.3144	0.8041829999999999814	2112.5599999999999	1997.8499999999999	2057.2199999999998	2005.99	0.97509599999999996	3.9170600000000002	3.95194	0.0128	1.0089115	426.22199999999998	229.32400000000001	407.798	244.608	0.59982599999999997	0.783744	0.52986100000000003	-0.5648	0.67606416	738.51900000000001	686.274	712.32000000000005	706.07500000000005	0.99123300000000003	1.4505600000000001	1.4499	-0.0007	0.9995460000000000517	2112.5599999999999	1997.8499999999999	2057.2199999999998	2005.99	0.97509599999999996	3.9170600000000002	3.95194	0.0128	1.0089118	1343.5	1025.9100000000001	1303.6099999999999	1046.71	0.80293400000000004	2.5774300000000001	2.0727199999999999	-0.3144	0.8041829999999999819	210.91999999999999	169.06200000000001	197.524	183.37799999999999	0.92838699999999996	0.33361299999999999	0.31042599999999998	-0.1039	0.9304989999999999720	679.90700000000004	508.16899999999998	655.726	527.15099999999995	0.803921	1.34504	1.1994499999999999	-0.1653	0.89175400000000005!sample_table_end
