Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322897/suppl/GSM322897.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1833.3099999999999	1429.8800000000001	1850.1500000000001	1350.97	0.73019299999999998	1.0825199999999999	0.77049199999999995	-0.4905	0.711756999999999972	7095.2600000000002	7358.1099999999997	6769.1800000000003	7622.3599999999997	1.1260399999999999	3.9589300000000001	4.4290200000000004	0.1619	1.11874000000000013	402.97300000000001	846.60400000000004	555.64700000000005	661.41099999999994	1.19034	0.35231200000000001	0.43254300000000001	0.2960	1.227734	7862.9799999999996	6060.0699999999997	7506.5799999999999	6291.1599999999999	0.838086	4.4566600000000003	3.83168	-0.2180	0.8597655	377.69299999999998	817.28399999999999	531.73500000000001	624.92600000000004	1.17526	0.28146100000000002	0.33072600000000002	0.2327	1.175036	320.23099999999999	803.00900000000001	476.66399999999999	607.447	1.27437	0.28252699999999997	0.35733999999999999	0.3389	1.26479999999999997	3037.7600000000002	2790.9699999999998	2950	2856.4400000000001	0.96828599999999998	1.90141	1.8304	-0.0549	0.962651000000000038	5972.8199999999997	5040.3400000000001	5698.1099999999997	5235.8900000000003	0.91888300000000001	3.09178	2.80829	-0.1387	0.908305999999999959	8074.0900000000001	6833.2299999999996	7818.6700000000001	6974.1700000000001	0.89198999999999995	4.5095900000000002	3.9307699999999999	-0.1982	0.8716469999999999510	188.816	639.197	344.97899999999998	408.97300000000001	1.1855	0.19637299999999999	0.23179	0.2392	1.180360000000000111	594.31100000000004	1142.6700000000001	733.04700000000003	1018.96	1.3900300000000001	0.37690499999999999	0.49838500000000002	0.4031	1.322310000000000112	1074.76	1399.95	1166.5	1307.8900000000001	1.12121	0.69710899999999998	0.75331999999999999	0.1119	1.0806313	8850.3099999999995	7050.9300000000003	8471.7199999999993	7306.4099999999999	0.86244799999999999	5.0932599999999999	4.3385199999999999	-0.2314	0.8518160000000000214	19268.599999999999	16418.400000000001	18703.900000000001	16572.099999999999	0.88602099999999995	11.2248	10.086	-0.1543	0.8985440000000000115	906.33799999999997	1310.04	1014.6	1214.02	1.19655	0.69809100000000002	0.83554300000000004	0.2593	1.196900000000000116	3211.5900000000001	2900.3600000000001	3114.4899999999998	2969.7800000000002	0.95353600000000005	1.7760800000000001	1.6684600000000001	-0.0902	0.9394059999999999617	19268.599999999999	16418.400000000001	18703.900000000001	16572.099999999999	0.88602099999999995	11.2248	10.086	-0.1543	0.8985440000000000118	8850.3099999999995	7050.9300000000003	8471.7199999999993	7306.4099999999999	0.86244799999999999	5.0932599999999999	4.3385199999999999	-0.2314	0.8518160000000000219	1074.76	1399.95	1166.5	1307.8900000000001	1.12121	0.69710899999999998	0.75331999999999999	0.1119	1.0806320	2873.2399999999998	2396.1599999999999	2798.3400000000001	2426.04	0.86695699999999998	2.1051799999999998	1.91629	-0.1356	0.91027599999999997!sample_table_end
