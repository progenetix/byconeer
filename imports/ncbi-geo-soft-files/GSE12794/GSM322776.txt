Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322776/suppl/GSM322776.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	250.04900000000001	238.64400000000001	241.53800000000001	248.001	1.0267599999999999	0.55452400000000002	0.53668700000000003	-0.0472	0.967833999999999972	3005.9200000000001	3039.1799999999998	3336.4699999999998	2700.7399999999998	0.80946200000000001	7.9928400000000002	6.8823800000000004	-0.2158	0.861067999999999943	220.74700000000001	160	211.251	172.684	0.81743600000000005	0.39938800000000002	0.34617599999999998	-0.2063	0.866766000000000044	5025.2399999999998	5841.1599999999999	5647.3400000000001	5096.4499999999998	0.902451	12.144399999999999	11.404299999999999	-0.0907	0.9390525	160.542	111.444	152.38399999999999	126.31999999999999	0.82895399999999997	0.31579600000000002	0.275092	-0.1991	0.871107999999999996	203.22200000000001	171.489	193.483	183.71199999999999	0.94949600000000001	0.44306099999999998	0.42605199999999999	-0.0565	0.961610999999999997	347.66699999999997	383.39600000000002	344.471	382.46300000000002	1.11029	0.75159200000000004	0.77231899999999998	0.0393	1.02757999999999998	316.85300000000001	265.99099999999999	311.65300000000002	273.39800000000002	0.87725200000000003	0.68966899999999998	0.63357200000000002	-0.1224	0.918660999999999959	727.72500000000002	641.35299999999995	757.27599999999995	618.68299999999999	0.81698499999999996	1.5323899999999999	1.22699	-0.3207	0.8006990000000000510	141.46299999999999	165.02600000000001	135.88999999999999	178.31399999999999	1.31219	0.28528399999999998	0.36637500000000001	0.3609	1.284249999999999911	139.99100000000001	117.182	134.34299999999999	131.702	0.98034100000000002	0.29719899999999999	0.29213800000000001	-0.0248	0.9829719999999999612	175.41200000000001	165.56399999999999	166.43199999999999	178.035	1.06972	0.32276500000000002	0.32834000000000002	0.0247	1.017269999999999913	788.65700000000004	765.40700000000004	824.11699999999996	731.27800000000002	0.88734800000000003	1.7209099999999999	1.50048	-0.1978	0.8719090000000000514	1553.1700000000001	1586.5699999999999	1681.3599999999999	1450.75	0.86284700000000003	3.6718199999999999	3.1874099999999999	-0.2041	0.8680729999999999815	291.28899999999999	265.178	284.60000000000002	272.64699999999999	0.95799900000000004	0.62838099999999997	0.64789300000000005	0.0441	1.0310516	607.46900000000005	590.89499999999998	626.77800000000002	572.09299999999996	0.91275200000000001	1.39184	1.3292900000000001	-0.0663	0.9550600000000000217	1553.1700000000001	1586.5699999999999	1681.3599999999999	1450.75	0.86284700000000003	3.6718199999999999	3.1874099999999999	-0.2041	0.8680729999999999818	788.65700000000004	765.40700000000004	824.11699999999996	731.27800000000002	0.88734800000000003	1.7209099999999999	1.50048	-0.1978	0.8719090000000000519	175.41200000000001	165.56399999999999	166.43199999999999	178.035	1.06972	0.32276500000000002	0.32834000000000002	0.0247	1.017269999999999920	347.40899999999999	393	344.19299999999998	391.36500000000001	1.1370499999999999	0.84757199999999999	0.99468999999999996	0.2309	1.1735800000000001!sample_table_end
