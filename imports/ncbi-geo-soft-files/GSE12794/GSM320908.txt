Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320908/suppl/GSM320908.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1469	1265	1423.8807000000002	1301.0874000000001	0.91376153999999998	0.84180555000000001	0.77261013000000001	-0.1237	0.917801179999999992	1845	1603	1793.1921	1641.9194	0.91564053000000001	1.1230613999999999	1.0263667999999999	-0.1299	0.913900880000000033	1195	1037	1156.2359000000001	1072.1756	0.92729828999999997	0.72640404000000003	0.68750224000000004	-0.0794	0.946446050000000044	7136	6606	6956.8477000000003	6702.2706000000007	0.96340625999999996	4.880458	4.8476841999999998	-0.0097	0.993284669999999985	7817	9806	7610.125	10002.538	1.31437241	5.7620613999999994	7.8254513999999995	0.4416	1.35809929999999996	5157	4862	5040.6989000000003	4930.2982000000002	0.97809813999999995	3.4749664999999998	3.5083411	0.0138	1.00960429999999997	1000	847	964.74272000000008	879.64890000000003	0.91179639999999995	1.0385726	0.97341491000000002	-0.0935	0.937262290000000058	1463	1371	1418.0022000000001	1408.6958	0.99343698999999996	1.0062081	1.0243789999999999	0.0258	1.01805879999999999	1538	1403	1492.222	1441.0222000000001	0.96568891000000001	0.86690122000000003	0.83689977000000004	-0.0508	0.9653923100000000310	5608	4945	5479.4387999999999	5013.8696	0.9150334	4.2752609000000001	3.9133665	-0.1276	0.9153515100000000311	8193	7113	7973.7759000000005	7220.5023000000001	0.90553112999999996	5.8194283999999996	5.3673126999999994	-0.1167	0.9223092600000000212	3999	3429	3908.8704000000002	3483.3352	0.89113600999999998	3.2674086	2.9465208999999999	-0.1491	0.9017913600000000413	1205	1348	1166.0492000000002	1385.4535000000001	1.1881603599999999	1.0577026999999999	1.2142894	0.1992	1.148044214	8149	7054	7931.1762000000008	7159.7151000000003	0.90273055000000002	4.9735512000000002	4.4643041999999999	-0.1558	0.8976089815	1031	852	994.94509000000005	884.72000000000003	0.88921486000000005	0.68209845999999996	0.61026754000000005	-0.1605	0.8946912700000000416	803	839	772.85663000000011	871.53380000000004	1.12767846	0.68647743999999999	0.78881308000000006	0.2005	1.149073599999999917	398	355	379.87644000000006	379.08440000000002	0.99791505999999996	0.24589140000000001	0.24325437999999999	-0.0156	0.9892756799999999918	2800	2450	2730.8828000000003	2497.6935000000003	0.91461026999999995	1.8233585999999999	1.7046109999999999	-0.0972	0.9348742800000000619	832	747	801.27021000000002	778.59140000000002	0.97169647000000003	0.51461329	0.49107050000000002	-0.0676	0.9542515000000000320	1110	761	1072.5346	792.80830000000003	0.73919139	0.69939947999999996	0.49948182000000002	-0.4857	0.71415812000000001!sample_table_end
