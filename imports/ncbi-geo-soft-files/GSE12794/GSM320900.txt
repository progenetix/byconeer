Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320900/suppl/GSM320900.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1663	1418	1630.5820000000001	1442.5773000000002	0.88470090000000001	0.75151140000000005	0.72920585999999998	-0.0435	0.970319099999999992	2566	2172	2493.2443000000003	2220.9163000000003	0.89077360000000005	1.3612601	1.2932986	-0.0739	0.950074599999999993	1692	1610	1658.4198000000001	1641.3965000000001	0.98973520000000004	0.77007097000000002	0.82161434	0.0935	1.06693329999999994	7830	5820	7422.2120000000004	6012.9264000000003	0.81012589999999995	3.5552515999999996	3.1041493	-0.1958	0.873116600000000025	8669	10110	8208.5442000000003	10413.857	1.2686607000000001	4.6120732999999996	6.0554562999999995	0.3928	1.31295756	4973	4321	4753.4102000000003	4451.3420999999998	0.93645230000000002	2.3455436000000001	2.3723294999999998	0.0164	1.01141989999999997	920	1161	906.70688000000007	1182.2270000000001	1.3038689999999999	0.84981830000000003	1.0157704999999999	0.2573	1.19527959999999998	1295	1163	1272.962	1184.2830000000001	0.93033650000000001	0.66832303999999998	0.63491454000000003	-0.0740	0.950011400000000069	1788	1794	1750.8996000000002	1827.3507000000002	1.0436639000000001	0.89683617000000004	0.98383651000000005	0.1336	1.097008110	6983	7046	6627.1124	7282.0416000000005	1.0988256999999999	4.1227651999999999	4.2558973999999994	0.0459	1.03229211	10209	10235	9657.4475000000002	10541.657999999999	1.0915573999999999	5.8828753999999996	6.0831530999999996	0.0483	1.034044199999999912	2673	2302	2596.0933	2354.6127000000001	0.90698310000000004	2.2590733999999997	1.9221465999999998	-0.2330	0.8508562000000000613	741	905	733.30579000000012	922.56029000000012	1.258084	0.73072561000000003	0.78570960000000001	0.1047	1.075245714	5712	4903	5438.8510999999999	5055.9849000000004	0.92960529999999997	3.3191538999999999	3.2732771000000001	-0.0201	0.986178215	1279	1309	1257.6157000000001	1332.6101000000001	1.0596322	0.91142716000000001	0.90279187999999999	-0.0137	0.9905255000000000616	766	980	757.57256000000007	998.23878000000013	1.3176808	0.65307117000000003	0.78995944000000007	0.2745	1.209606999999999917	505	465	505.32515000000006	475.27891000000005	0.94054079999999995	0.25927032	0.26465010999999999	0.0296	1.020749699999999918	2539	2368	2467.3481999999999	2423.0695000000001	0.98205410000000004	1.3247476	1.3715454	0.0501	1.035325899999999919	1661	1348	1628.6619000000001	1371.4865	0.84209409999999996	0.82200232000000006	0.72643530000000001	-0.1783	0.8837386999999999920	1239	1070	1219.2299	1089.049	0.89322699999999999	0.70957638000000001	0.60541093000000001	-0.2290	0.85320050000000003!sample_table_end
