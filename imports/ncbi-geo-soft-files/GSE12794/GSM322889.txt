Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322889/suppl/GSM322889.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	648.71100000000001	945.61300000000006	725.43499999999995	861.58100000000002	1.18767	0.65469699999999997	0.78492899999999999	0.2617	1.198922	6657.0200000000004	7248.75	6622.25	7218.9899999999998	1.0901099999999999	4.9988599999999996	5.2817600000000002	0.0794	1.05658999999999993	400.262	480.64400000000001	480.89499999999998	384.589	0.799736	0.38067499999999999	0.29230400000000001	-0.3811	0.767855999999999984	16462.400000000001	18619.400000000001	16171.799999999999	18796.099999999999	1.16228	13.409700000000001	14.923299999999999	0.1543	1.112875	302.66699999999997	567.33299999999997	384.14800000000002	472.31299999999999	1.2295100000000001	0.30544399999999999	0.35924400000000001	0.2341	1.176146	245.71600000000001	468.35599999999999	327.34199999999998	372.58100000000002	1.1382000000000001	0.28708499999999998	0.32244200000000001	0.1676	1.12315999999999997	2214.4000000000001	2172.5100000000002	2257.6500000000001	2112.6399999999999	0.93576899999999996	1.8484	1.8103400000000001	-0.0300	0.979408999999999978	3375.9400000000001	3530.0999999999999	3396.71	3482.3499999999999	1.02521	2.5721799999999999	2.6100099999999999	0.0211	1.014719	4807.1899999999996	4289.8299999999999	4813.6199999999999	4232.8599999999997	0.87935099999999999	3.85595	3.3989099999999999	-0.1820	0.8814720000000000310	150.428	341.60300000000001	228.96600000000001	258.29700000000003	1.1281000000000001	0.162269	0.181613	0.1625	1.1192111	354.55099999999999	559.37800000000004	435.803	464.22199999999998	1.06521	0.31048799999999999	0.34017799999999998	0.1317	1.0956212	651.30399999999997	825.88599999999997	732.81100000000004	736.93799999999999	1.00563	0.60089300000000001	0.62384799999999996	0.0541	1.038213	5071.7399999999998	4607.5699999999997	5065.8699999999999	4563.5100000000002	0.90083500000000005	4.3114299999999997	3.9063099999999999	-0.1424	0.9060350000000000314	8470.9300000000003	8402.9799999999996	8400.1599999999999	8382.4899999999998	0.99789600000000001	7.1213899999999999	7.11808	-0.0007	0.9995349999999999515	1190.4000000000001	1196.8199999999999	1254.8499999999999	1119.54	0.89216899999999999	0.98232399999999997	0.85499800000000004	-0.2003	0.8703819999999999916	1962.3800000000001	2160.8899999999999	2012.28	2099.8299999999999	1.0435099999999999	1.60785	1.5906199999999999	-0.0155	0.9892809999999999717	8470.9300000000003	8402.9799999999996	8400.1599999999999	8382.4899999999998	0.99789600000000001	7.1213899999999999	7.11808	-0.0007	0.9995349999999999518	5071.7399999999998	4607.5699999999997	5065.8699999999999	4563.5100000000002	0.90083500000000005	4.3114299999999997	3.9063099999999999	-0.1424	0.9060350000000000319	651.30399999999997	825.88599999999997	732.81100000000004	736.93799999999999	1.00563	0.60089300000000001	0.62384799999999996	0.0541	1.038220	1832.02	1746.5999999999999	1882.6400000000001	1679.1700000000001	0.89192199999999999	1.4981	1.29708	-0.2079	0.86581399999999997!sample_table_end
