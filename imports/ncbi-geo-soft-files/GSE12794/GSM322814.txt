Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322814/suppl/GSM322814.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3988.6700000000001	4308.9200000000001	3877.6700000000001	4307.4700000000003	1.11084	4.0603499999999997	4.4521100000000002	0.1329	1.09647999999999992	9258.6299999999992	10894.299999999999	8814.4300000000003	11341.299999999999	1.28668	10.9236	13.919499999999999	0.3497	1.27425999999999993	135.38200000000001	97.852999999999994	113.94	121.98399999999999	1.0706	0.089745400000000003	0.1082	0.2698	1.205644	13168.5	11051.299999999999	12306.299999999999	11519.700000000001	0.93607899999999999	10.196	11.041	0.1149	1.08288000000000015	690.62199999999996	547.88	681.57799999999997	561.87400000000002	0.82437300000000002	0.63635200000000003	0.57124399999999997	-0.1557	0.897684999999999966	389.37799999999999	260.11099999999999	376.09800000000001	280.476	0.74575400000000003	0.36609700000000001	0.28464800000000001	-0.3630	0.777521000000000027	4074.3400000000001	4884.1400000000003	3958.8200000000002	4892.1499999999996	1.23576	4.5415700000000001	5.64581	0.3140	1.24313999999999998	1433.3299999999999	1666.5699999999999	1416.22	1665.8800000000001	1.1762900000000001	1.53973	1.7440599999999999	0.1798	1.13271000000000019	7245.5200000000004	6804.7799999999997	6941.25	6897.6899999999996	0.99372400000000005	7.8110400000000002	7.5803700000000003	-0.0432	0.9704690000000000310	126.154	86.370500000000007	105.23099999999999	110.49299999999999	1.0500100000000001	0.13617899999999999	0.136631	0.0048	1.0033211	666.178	678.15599999999995	656.95799999999997	690.19500000000005	1.0505899999999999	0.62364399999999998	0.66442599999999996	0.0914	1.065390000000000112	788.10000000000002	769.04899999999998	778.94899999999996	779.55100000000004	1.0007699999999999	0.86459399999999997	0.85155700000000001	-0.0219	0.9849210000000000513	5826.6000000000004	4962.1000000000004	5612.75	4985.7200000000003	0.88828499999999999	5.6430400000000001	5.1154999999999999	-0.1416	0.9065149999999999614	3099.0100000000002	3020.0900000000001	3023.98	3020.0300000000002	0.99869399999999997	3.1025999999999998	3.2162600000000001	0.0519	1.036629999999999915	1948.6199999999999	1619.29	1918.54	1619.25	0.84399900000000005	1.61859	1.5398099999999999	-0.0720	0.9513249999999999816	1798.6700000000001	1320.51	1772.8	1323.9200000000001	0.74679799999999996	1.98946	1.5132399999999999	-0.3947	0.7606300000000000317	3099.0100000000002	3020.0900000000001	3023.98	3020.0300000000002	0.99869399999999997	3.1025999999999998	3.2162600000000001	0.0519	1.036629999999999918	5826.6000000000004	4962.1000000000004	5612.75	4985.7200000000003	0.88828499999999999	5.6430400000000001	5.1154999999999999	-0.1416	0.9065149999999999619	788.10000000000002	769.04899999999998	778.94899999999996	779.55100000000004	1.0007699999999999	0.86459399999999997	0.85155700000000001	-0.0219	0.9849210000000000520	2678.6500000000001	2377.1599999999999	2627.3600000000001	2369.9699999999998	0.90203299999999997	2.3666800000000001	2.30403	-0.0387	0.97352899999999998!sample_table_end
