Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322905/suppl/GSM322905.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1223.27	1299.96	1236.5	1283.6099999999999	1.0381	0.82769000000000004	0.86782099999999995	0.0683	1.04848999999999992	4165.2700000000004	5753.9399999999996	4204.9300000000003	5652.5600000000004	1.3442700000000001	3.5590799999999998	4.64933	0.3855	1.306333	404	423.39600000000002	403.91899999999998	429.05500000000001	1.06223	0.32661800000000002	0.34105200000000002	0.0624	1.044194	5120.9399999999996	7141.8299999999999	5155.8500000000004	7029.3100000000004	1.3633599999999999	4.0922299999999998	5.4229799999999999	0.4062	1.32519000000000015	335.92000000000002	502.02199999999999	336.38200000000001	505.48899999999998	1.5027200000000001	0.24818999999999999	0.36928800000000001	0.5733	1.487936	558.43600000000004	421.31999999999999	559.58100000000002	427.03500000000003	0.76313299999999995	0.41194399999999998	0.31692199999999998	-0.3783	0.769332000000000027	2979.6399999999999	3229.3400000000001	3014.6900000000001	3168.5900000000001	1.05105	1.93973	2.1186500000000001	0.1273	1.09224000000000018	3347.27	3913.1300000000001	3386.27	3836.79	1.13304	2.6749399999999999	3.0247000000000002	0.1773	1.130769	5199.1899999999996	5822.1400000000003	5232.6899999999996	5724.8500000000004	1.09406	3.6812800000000001	4.1001899999999996	0.1555	1.113790000000000110	225.42599999999999	229.36799999999999	230.50800000000001	241.96899999999999	1.04972	0.17213700000000001	0.17899499999999999	0.0564	1.039840000000000111	458.31099999999998	493.25799999999998	458.43299999999999	496.97500000000002	1.0840700000000001	0.28978100000000001	0.31823699999999999	0.1351	1.098200000000000112	751.11800000000005	811.57600000000002	755.18399999999997	807.74599999999998	1.0696000000000001	0.48728500000000002	0.53644800000000004	0.1387	1.100889999999999913	5782.6300000000001	7138.8299999999999	5811.4499999999998	7026.6599999999999	1.2091099999999999	3.9732400000000001	4.8409599999999999	0.2850	1.218390000000000114	11065.799999999999	14274.5	11060.799999999999	14100.200000000001	1.27478	8.30931	10.6822	0.3624	1.285579999999999915	1018.74	1293.26	1028.3099999999999	1277.0599999999999	1.2419	0.91514700000000004	1.0680400000000001	0.2229	1.167070000000000116	3154.1700000000001	3708.8400000000001	3189.5100000000002	3641.3400000000001	1.1416599999999999	2.6039300000000001	2.94468	0.1774	1.1308617	11065.799999999999	14274.5	11060.799999999999	14100.200000000001	1.27478	8.30931	10.6822	0.3624	1.285579999999999918	5782.6300000000001	7138.8299999999999	5811.4499999999998	7026.6599999999999	1.2091099999999999	3.9732400000000001	4.8409599999999999	0.2850	1.218390000000000119	751.11800000000005	811.57600000000002	755.18399999999997	807.74599999999998	1.0696000000000001	0.48728500000000002	0.53644800000000004	0.1387	1.100889999999999920	1681	1847.6900000000001	1700.72	1818.46	1.0692299999999999	1.6001399999999999	1.5972999999999999	-0.0026	0.99822900000000003!sample_table_end
