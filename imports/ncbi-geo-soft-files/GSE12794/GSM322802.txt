Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322802/suppl/GSM322802.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	284.35599999999999	262.69299999999998	260.13600000000002	288.101	1.1074999999999999	0.432141	0.47374300000000003	0.1326	1.09627000000000012	3016.5999999999999	3450.5599999999999	3078.5300000000002	3313.8600000000001	1.0764400000000001	5.7840600000000002	6.2409699999999999	0.1097	1.0793	314.95600000000002	248.84399999999999	288.67599999999999	274.13299999999998	0.94962299999999999	0.41004099999999999	0.39929799999999999	-0.0383	0.973801000000000034	4117.8900000000003	3899.9499999999998	4223.6099999999997	3738.0999999999999	0.88504899999999997	5.8630000000000004	5.3569199999999997	-0.1302	0.913683000000000025	256.50200000000001	198.191	235.27099999999999	223.93899999999999	0.95183399999999996	0.32115199999999999	0.31677699999999998	-0.0198	0.986379000000000016	296.68900000000002	199	271.54500000000002	224.73599999999999	0.82761799999999996	0.42259000000000002	0.34781899999999999	-0.2809	0.823064000000000027	436.37799999999999	437.59100000000001	406.98200000000003	462.101	1.1354299999999999	0.76862299999999995	0.84822299999999995	0.1422	1.10356000000000018	420.702	452.37299999999999	391.39999999999998	476.70100000000002	1.21794	0.599881	0.73953899999999995	0.3020	1.232819	653.62199999999996	592.971	624.93799999999999	616.49400000000003	0.98648899999999995	1.0762400000000001	1.04179	-0.0469	0.9679900000000000210	239.321	205.501	220.59999999999999	231.334	1.0486599999999999	0.424709	0.42110599999999998	-0.0123	0.9915169999999999811	212.44	185.80000000000001	198.911	211.994	1.0657700000000001	0.29824600000000001	0.320303	0.1029	1.0739612	237.566	197.636	222.066	223.47999999999999	1.00637	0.37649899999999997	0.36757099999999998	-0.0346	0.9762849999999999613	1031.95	825.221	1014.17	841.33699999999999	0.82957800000000004	1.5829299999999999	1.3096300000000001	-0.2734	0.8273470000000000514	1669.49	1741.47	1674.25	1707.74	1.0200100000000001	2.91751	3.0234800000000002	0.0515	1.036319999999999915	518.44399999999996	429.35599999999999	489.084	453.95499999999998	0.92817300000000003	0.71227200000000002	0.70925800000000006	-0.0061	0.9957669999999999616	732.09500000000003	835.024	705.94399999999996	847.45600000000002	1.2004600000000001	1.05118	1.2716000000000001	0.2746	1.209680000000000117	1669.49	1741.47	1674.25	1707.74	1.0200100000000001	2.91751	3.0234800000000002	0.0515	1.036319999999999918	1031.95	825.221	1014.17	841.33699999999999	0.82957800000000004	1.5829299999999999	1.3096300000000001	-0.2734	0.8273470000000000519	237.566	197.636	222.066	223.47999999999999	1.00637	0.37649899999999997	0.36757099999999998	-0.0346	0.9762849999999999620	609.09299999999996	561.42200000000003	581.19000000000005	582.95000000000005	1.0030300000000001	0.91159100000000004	0.99268900000000004	0.1230	1.0889599999999999!sample_table_end
