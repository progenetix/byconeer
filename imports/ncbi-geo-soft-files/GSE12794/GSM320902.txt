Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320902/suppl/GSM320902.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1628	1394	1634.5132000000001	1386.7304000000001	0.84840570000000004	1.0158449000000001	0.9320773	-0.1242	0.917538999999999992	1833	1582	1839.0633	1570.8245000000002	0.85414380000000001	1.2955094999999999	1.1750753	-0.1408	0.907037199999999993	901	1096	903.14828000000011	1095.3314	1.2127924000000001	0.61916418000000006	0.78192965999999997	0.3367	1.26287939999999994	4039	3689	4038.8055000000004	3638.0306	0.90076889999999998	2.6542322	2.5052645999999998	-0.0833	0.943875400000000035	5348	7220	5338.3614000000007	7106.7828	1.3312667	3.9594277999999998	5.4851399999999995	0.4702	1.38533666	3864	3426	3865.1328000000003	3381.5681	0.87489050000000002	2.7572581999999999	2.5582425	-0.1081	0.927821200000000017	849	1167	850.98998000000006	1164.6161	1.3685426999999999	0.68719204	0.88948634999999998	0.3723	1.29437809999999998	978	1054	979.76140000000009	1053.9627	1.0757341	0.62085641000000003	0.66499773000000006	0.0991	1.07109759	1988	2047	1996.0940000000001	2027.4766000000002	1.015722	1.3141349999999998	1.4038307999999999	0.0953	1.068254710	4174	5436	4171.9495999999999	5350.0275000000001	1.2823807	2.7000017999999999	3.3194013	0.2980	1.229406999999999911	11054	10163	10889.312	10052.879000000001	0.92318770000000006	7.3367733999999993	6.6243726000000001	-0.1474	0.9029000000000000412	2415	2479	2423.1966000000002	2454.6813999999999	1.0129931000000001	1.8752974	1.7782041	-0.0767	0.9482251000000000413	1194	1922	1197.0101	1904.9623000000001	1.5914337999999999	0.95121768000000007	1.2758077999999999	0.4236	1.341236399999999914	3294	3196	3300.0918000000001	3158.7809000000002	0.95717969999999997	2.6284403999999997	2.6075075999999999	-0.0115	0.9920360999999999815	1310	1786	1312.1670000000001	1769.9277000000002	1.3488585	0.91541378000000007	1.1423422999999999	0.3195	1.247897199999999916	1123	1449	1126.7369000000001	1441.3156000000001	1.2791945	0.82499304000000007	1.0005902	0.2784	1.212846799999999917	511	582	515.71607000000006	588.43596000000002	1.1410076	0.34577375999999999	0.41876157000000003	0.2763	1.211085518	1974	1789	1981.9962	1772.9111	0.89450779999999996	1.4940207999999999	1.4380948	-0.0550	0.9625668000000000619	1361	1285	1364.0598	1279.3856000000001	0.9379248	0.88217944999999998	0.84923791999999998	-0.0549	0.9626588999999999820	1121	1159	1124.7116000000001	1156.8778	1.0285995999999999	0.6176161	0.61893081999999999	0.0031	1.0021286999999999!sample_table_end
