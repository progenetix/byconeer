Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320914/suppl/GSM320914.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1940	1604	1927.3392000000001	1612.7221000000002	0.83676090000000003	0.74698202999999996	0.66842493000000003	-0.1603	0.894834000000000022	2287	1973	2267.5954000000002	1980.5121000000001	0.87339750000000005	0.96617304999999998	0.88823024000000006	-0.1213	0.919328299999999993	1559	1457	1548.7773	1468.1789000000001	0.94796000000000002	0.61970926000000004	0.63287342000000002	0.0303	1.02124250000000014	10593	9041	10256.034	9147.8311000000012	0.89194629999999997	4.4088539999999998	4.0291408999999998	-0.1299	0.913874900000000055	12510	13751	12060.153	14005.467000000001	1.1613009999999999	5.2926760000000002	6.6501359999999998	0.3294	1.25647899999999996	5918	5669	5793.8357000000005	5721.3081000000002	0.98748190000000002	2.6203183999999999	2.7965276999999999	0.0939	1.06724737	2258	2319	2239.3450000000003	2328.4794000000002	1.0398037	0.96311115000000003	1.0979174	0.1890	1.13996959999999998	1820	1917	1809.1334000000002	1923.8244000000002	1.0633956	0.80759289000000001	0.84721806	0.0691	1.04906579999999999	2118	1977	2101.7458999999999	1984.5345000000002	0.94423140000000005	0.86731931000000007	0.86333572000000003	-0.0066	0.9954070000000000410	8035	8795	7826.1665000000003	8896.026100000001	1.1367029	4.6038705999999996	4.5072953999999994	-0.0306	0.9790229999999999811	9438	9496	9158.8736000000008	9614.5138000000006	1.0497485	4.6404706999999998	4.4300889999999997	-0.0669	0.954663712	6838	5498	6678.2678000000005	5547.6887000000006	0.83070770000000005	3.1833195999999999	2.5987475999999998	-0.2927	0.8163639999999999813	1745	2131	1733.0510000000002	2139.1550000000002	1.2343289	1.0200682999999999	1.0922411999999999	0.0986	1.070752914	9664	7085	9373.4058000000005	7154.3366000000005	0.76325900000000002	4.3729205000000002	3.6254807999999996	-0.2704	0.8290754000000000215	1688	1683	1675.8553000000002	1689.5993000000001	1.0082012	0.73705229000000005	0.70614770000000004	-0.0618	0.9580699999999999816	1892	2402	1880.2558000000001	2412.4848999999999	1.2830621	0.82286967	1.0855074	0.3996	1.319172899999999917	537	540	544.49827000000005	553.92166000000009	1.0173065999999999	0.23293334000000002	0.24988587000000001	0.1014	1.072778499999999918	3067	2534	3033.0889999999999	2545.7722000000003	0.8393332	1.2501118	1.1645113	-0.1023	0.9315257000000000119	1572	1433	1561.4173000000001	1444.3800000000001	0.92504419999999998	0.69718000000000002	0.65316490999999999	-0.0941	0.9368670000000000120	1365	1359	1359.3958	1369.9917	1.0077946	0.84516027999999999	0.73193531000000001	-0.2075	0.86603140000000001!sample_table_end
