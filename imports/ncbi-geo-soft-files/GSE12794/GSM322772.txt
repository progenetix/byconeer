Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322772/suppl/GSM322772.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1127.47	1596.78	1287.47	1380.9100000000001	1.0725800000000001	1.6578299999999999	1.6610100000000001	0.0028	1.00191999999999992	7022.75	9510.4699999999993	8297.2099999999991	7889.9300000000003	0.95091400000000004	9.4372100000000003	9.4143299999999996	-0.0035	0.997576000000000023	170.27600000000001	174.62200000000001	172.124	178.054	1.0344500000000001	0.18890699999999999	0.213559	0.1770	1.13050000000000014	14731.9	19747.299999999999	17207.400000000001	16667.599999999999	0.96862499999999996	20.1264	21.217500000000001	0.0762	1.05421000000000015	332.11099999999999	301	359.41000000000003	287.70999999999998	0.80050600000000005	0.37631199999999998	0.33479599999999998	-0.1686	0.889676000000000026	244.15100000000001	271.476	257.22300000000001	262.13099999999997	1.01908	0.28055400000000003	0.30859999999999999	0.1375	1.09996999999999997	1569.48	2400.4299999999998	1806.55	2044.6300000000001	1.1317900000000001	2.4636200000000001	2.5386899999999999	0.0433	1.030478	543.56899999999996	801.55100000000004	605.61599999999999	714.78499999999997	1.1802600000000001	0.71585500000000002	0.871502	0.2838	1.217439	2419.3200000000002	2865.1500000000001	2816.52	2424.54	0.86082800000000004	3.2658200000000002	2.7484700000000002	-0.2488	0.8415869999999999710	155.78899999999999	145.935	155.642	152.965	0.98280000000000001	0.18385799999999999	0.16853899999999999	-0.1255	0.9166809999999999711	519.55600000000004	625.62199999999996	577.56799999999998	565.37400000000002	0.97888799999999998	0.56289199999999995	0.58422200000000002	0.0537	1.0378912	279.22300000000001	364.79700000000003	297.774	342.45600000000002	1.15005	0.39385599999999998	0.422263	0.1005	1.0721213	2655.29	3265.5999999999999	3099.3800000000001	2755.4899999999998	0.88904300000000003	3.5914600000000001	3.2117900000000001	-0.1612	0.8942860000000000314	2529.3099999999999	3034.5900000000001	2944.77	2569.25	0.872479	3.5909800000000001	3.18852	-0.1715	0.8879240000000000515	1320.1199999999999	1464.76	1513.27	1271.3599999999999	0.840144	1.9003099999999999	1.7559199999999999	-0.1140	0.9240190000000000316	1180.1700000000001	1321.55	1349.28	1152.1700000000001	0.85391399999999995	1.6460900000000001	1.49573	-0.1382	0.9086589999999999917	2529.3099999999999	3034.5900000000001	2944.77	2569.25	0.872479	3.5909800000000001	3.18852	-0.1715	0.8879240000000000518	2655.29	3265.5999999999999	3099.3800000000001	2755.4899999999998	0.88904300000000003	3.5914600000000001	3.2117900000000001	-0.1612	0.8942860000000000319	279.22300000000001	364.79700000000003	297.774	342.45600000000002	1.15005	0.39385599999999998	0.422263	0.1005	1.0721220	724.45799999999997	1033.0599999999999	816.49199999999996	910.19299999999998	1.11476	1.21712	1.3849	0.1863	1.13785!sample_table_end
