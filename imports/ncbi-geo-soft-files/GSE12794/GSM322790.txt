Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322790/suppl/GSM322790.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1022.53	1201.1099999999999	941.54200000000003	1288.75	1.36877	1.0180199999999999	1.40612	0.4660	1.381232	6992.4499999999998	6520.6700000000001	6715.96	6521.2200000000003	0.97100399999999998	6.38192	6.19956	-0.0418	0.971426000000000013	265.41300000000001	201.64400000000001	230.124	238.661	1.0370999999999999	0.18265600000000001	0.209647	0.1988	1.147774	14353.1	11170.200000000001	14104.799999999999	11089.299999999999	0.78621099999999999	11.116400000000001	10.0038	-0.1521	0.899915000000000025	329.44400000000002	239.96899999999999	289.46499999999997	280.44299999999998	0.96883300000000006	0.275314	0.277308	0.0104	1.00723999999999996	245.27099999999999	239.60900000000001	211.66300000000001	280.05200000000002	1.32311	0.222964	0.30200500000000002	0.4378	1.35457	1430.5	1544.6199999999999	1326.3499999999999	1638.72	1.2355	1.66936	1.9896	0.2532	1.19182999999999998	918.02200000000005	1197.6400000000001	842.81100000000004	1285.25	1.5249600000000001	0.715808	1.05996	0.5664	1.480789	3669.1799999999998	2929.9000000000001	3472.9899999999998	3021.1100000000001	0.86988699999999997	3.3816199999999998	2.8770500000000001	-0.2331	0.8507909999999999610	167.34399999999999	128.76400000000001	142.863	158.81100000000001	1.1116299999999999	0.14966099999999999	0.163636	0.1288	1.0933811	134.02199999999999	88.849000000000004	114.309	114.006	0.99734900000000004	0.10172200000000001	0.108761	0.0965	1.069199999999999912	362.76499999999999	330.15499999999997	320.37	377.51900000000001	1.17839	0.390708	0.46008599999999999	0.2358	1.1775713	4467.79	3200.2199999999998	4250.75	3287.1399999999999	0.77330699999999997	4.6706300000000001	3.71679	-0.3296	0.7957800000000000414	5908.0600000000004	4927.9700000000003	5650.0299999999997	4980.6899999999996	0.88153199999999998	5.7623499999999996	5.2720900000000004	-0.1283	0.9149199999999999615	2449.2600000000002	2181.1300000000001	2299.9299999999998	2281.0100000000002	0.99177599999999999	1.83897	2.1406299999999998	0.2191	1.1640416	3003.98	2603.75	2828.79	2698.4099999999999	0.95391099999999995	2.5658599999999998	2.4618000000000002	-0.0597	0.9594439999999999617	5908.0600000000004	4927.9700000000003	5650.0299999999997	4980.6899999999996	0.88153199999999998	5.7623499999999996	5.2720900000000004	-0.1283	0.9149199999999999618	4467.79	3200.2199999999998	4250.75	3287.1399999999999	0.77330699999999997	4.6706300000000001	3.71679	-0.3296	0.7957800000000000419	362.76499999999999	330.15499999999997	320.37	377.51900000000001	1.17839	0.390708	0.46008599999999999	0.2358	1.1775720	1624.8199999999999	1509.52	1511.55	1602.55	1.0602	1.39734	1.66736	0.2549	1.1932400000000001!sample_table_end
