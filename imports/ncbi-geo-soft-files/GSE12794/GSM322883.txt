Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322883/suppl/GSM322883.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2422.8400000000001	2229.6199999999999	2425.29	2202.6599999999999	0.90820199999999995	1.45181	1.3347899999999999	-0.1212	0.919401000000000022	6806.8900000000003	10323.1	6550.6499999999996	10673.1	1.6293299999999999	4.3559000000000001	6.65543	0.6116	1.52791000000000013	346.15600000000001	801.11099999999999	460.08499999999998	673.48099999999999	1.4638199999999999	0.33321000000000001	0.46634100000000001	0.4850	1.399544	9771.8700000000008	11589.200000000001	9347.3299999999999	11990.9	1.28281	7.5132300000000001	8.5496200000000009	0.1864	1.137945	646.95600000000002	863.79999999999995	751.54700000000003	741.51300000000003	0.986649	0.456955	0.43487700000000001	-0.0714	0.9516856	388.11099999999999	779	501.22800000000001	649.76199999999994	1.29634	0.34082600000000002	0.43551600000000001	0.3537	1.277837	6593.8400000000001	5588.4899999999998	6349.5600000000004	5740.4399999999996	0.90406900000000001	3.2796400000000001	3.0947499999999999	-0.0837	0.943625999999999968	6126.0600000000004	5910.8500000000004	5907.8900000000003	6078.04	1.0287999999999999	3.65327	3.6828099999999999	0.0116	1.00808999999999999	10997.6	9315.2399999999998	10519.200000000001	9607.9899999999998	0.91337800000000002	6.2276600000000002	5.80389	-0.1017	0.9319530000000000310	117.203	422.5	222.64400000000001	275.38499999999999	1.23688	0.12173299999999999	0.150507	0.3061	1.2363811	785.28399999999999	1069.0699999999999	883.68200000000002	963.38099999999997	1.09019	0.499666	0.55605400000000005	0.1543	1.112849999999999912	1275.47	1510.8099999999999	1355.4200000000001	1424.71	1.0511200000000001	0.71434799999999998	0.81013000000000002	0.1815	1.1340813	9837.2099999999991	8282.4599999999991	9415.9200000000001	8546.4599999999991	0.90766100000000005	5.4719199999999999	5.0485199999999999	-0.1162	0.9226229999999999714	14403	12680.299999999999	13717.4	13135.799999999999	0.95760400000000001	8.4674099999999992	8.2451899999999991	-0.0384	0.9737559999999999515	1215.8399999999999	1416.4400000000001	1290.97	1335.5699999999999	1.03454	1.08884	1.03624	-0.0714	0.9516900000000000416	2735.6700000000001	2446.1599999999999	2720.46	2428.02	0.89250499999999999	1.7360599999999999	1.48763	-0.2228	0.856917	14403	12680.299999999999	13717.4	13135.799999999999	0.95760400000000001	8.4674099999999992	8.2451899999999991	-0.0384	0.9737559999999999518	9837.2099999999991	8282.4599999999991	9415.9200000000001	8546.4599999999991	0.90766100000000005	5.4719199999999999	5.0485199999999999	-0.1162	0.9226229999999999719	1275.47	1510.8099999999999	1355.4200000000001	1424.71	1.0511200000000001	0.71434799999999998	0.81013000000000002	0.1815	1.1340820	2234.73	2578.5300000000002	2248.8000000000002	2574.5	1.14483	1.82741	1.95102	0.0944	1.0676399999999999!sample_table_end
