Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322780/suppl/GSM322780.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1063.3	1134.78	1084.27	1106.99	1.0209600000000001	1.341	1.3748199999999999	0.0359	1.025222	6340.8800000000001	7367.9300000000003	6686.3100000000004	6909.6800000000003	1.0334099999999999	8.1637500000000003	8.6584199999999996	0.0849	1.06058999999999993	148.11099999999999	156.31100000000001	141.95400000000001	165.977	1.16923	0.208538	0.25169999999999998	0.2714	1.20697000000000014	9995.2000000000007	11904.9	10561.799999999999	11165.4	1.05714	16.417899999999999	18.1739	0.1466	1.10695000000000015	283.16000000000003	221.667	279.07799999999997	229.53	0.82245699999999999	0.35087699999999999	0.29948200000000003	-0.2285	0.853523999999999956	251.733	278.62200000000001	246.88300000000001	284.89600000000002	1.1539699999999999	0.317882	0.37828600000000001	0.2510	1.19002000000000017	1480.9400000000001	1746.72	1518.53	1686.4400000000001	1.1105700000000001	1.96146	2.16995	0.1457	1.106298	781.10199999999998	1004.58	792.07100000000003	983.62800000000004	1.2418400000000001	0.89684600000000003	1.1216600000000001	0.3227	1.250689	2762.96	2610.0300000000002	2869.75	2493.21	0.868788	3.4731200000000002	3.01728	-0.2030	0.86875310	149.143	131.23500000000001	143.029	141.41499999999999	0.98871799999999999	0.16799700000000001	0.15940299999999999	-0.0758	0.9488450000000000511	379.57799999999997	400.15600000000001	378.197	402.58699999999999	1.0644899999999999	0.43274200000000002	0.47982599999999997	0.1490	1.108812	240.989	283.67899999999997	235.72	289.84699999999998	1.2296199999999999	0.30705300000000002	0.37558599999999998	0.2906	1.2231913	2059.23	2029.25	2124.96	1950.97	0.91812099999999996	2.6635900000000001	2.4862099999999998	-0.0994	0.9334029999999999814	2008.8099999999999	2079.5599999999999	2073.1999999999998	1997.8599999999999	0.96365699999999999	2.8793099999999998	2.8093400000000002	-0.0355	0.9756989999999999815	827.87599999999998	699.50199999999995	840.12800000000004	690.95699999999999	0.82244300000000004	1.47492	1.2815700000000001	-0.2027	0.8689040000000000116	1123.1300000000001	1187.25	1146.3399999999999	1156.51	1.0088699999999999	1.41442	1.45902	0.0448	1.031530000000000117	2008.8099999999999	2079.5599999999999	2073.1999999999998	1997.8599999999999	0.96365699999999999	2.8793099999999998	2.8093400000000002	-0.0355	0.9756989999999999818	2059.23	2029.25	2124.96	1950.97	0.91812099999999996	2.6635900000000001	2.4862099999999998	-0.0994	0.9334029999999999819	240.989	283.67899999999997	235.72	289.84699999999998	1.2296199999999999	0.30705300000000002	0.37558599999999998	0.2906	1.2231920	576.46699999999998	761.22199999999998	580.99400000000003	750.24800000000005	1.29132	1.1378200000000001	1.4781299999999999	0.3775	1.2990900000000001!sample_table_end
