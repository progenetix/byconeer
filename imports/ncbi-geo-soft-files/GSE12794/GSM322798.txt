Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322798/suppl/GSM322798.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	933.596	760.72000000000003	911.34400000000005	779.01099999999997	0.85479300000000003	0.95418999999999998	0.84404500000000005	-0.1770	0.884566999999999992	5193.25	5155.8800000000001	5073.9700000000003	5191.2399999999998	1.02311	6.2582000000000004	6.4048400000000001	0.0334	1.02343000000000013	206.858	212.86699999999999	202.05199999999999	223.99299999999999	1.10859	0.20114000000000001	0.231879	0.2052	1.152824	12309	9666.6200000000008	12064.799999999999	9752.0699999999997	0.80830500000000005	14.266999999999999	11.803699999999999	-0.2734	0.827343000000000055	245.75999999999999	195.88900000000001	238.44499999999999	206.75899999999999	0.86711300000000002	0.27899800000000002	0.23751900000000001	-0.2322	0.8513296	266.86700000000002	278.16399999999999	258.56799999999998	290.60399999999998	1.1238999999999999	0.30877500000000002	0.34872300000000001	0.1755	1.12938000000000017	1071.51	1384.75	1046.21	1405.6800000000001	1.34358	1.16605	1.56108	0.4209	1.338778	574.62199999999996	541.60000000000002	559.13999999999999	557.75400000000002	0.99751999999999996	0.70559499999999997	0.67919700000000005	-0.0550	0.9625889	1921.3099999999999	1832.9400000000001	1877.3099999999999	1856.72	0.98903200000000002	2.0480499999999999	2.0208699999999999	-0.0193	0.9867270000000000210	176.80699999999999	164.08699999999999	175.38900000000001	175.00999999999999	0.99783900000000003	0.21073500000000001	0.20955199999999999	-0.0081	0.9943849999999999611	377.75599999999997	302.87099999999998	366.08800000000002	315.762	0.86253000000000002	0.39907399999999998	0.35492699999999999	-0.1691	0.88937812	254.72800000000001	236.48500000000001	247.56200000000001	248.06299999999999	1.0020199999999999	0.26707700000000001	0.26893099999999998	0.0100	1.006939999999999913	2145.8200000000002	1634.5799999999999	2097.0900000000001	1659.52	0.79134000000000004	2.2606999999999999	1.81107	-0.3199	0.8011110000000000214	2738.0500000000002	2507.5999999999999	2675.6100000000001	2534.9899999999998	0.94744300000000004	3.04183	2.9064899999999998	-0.0657	0.95550715	655.79100000000005	596.04899999999998	638.18200000000002	612.64700000000005	0.95998799999999995	0.78878400000000004	0.79649899999999996	0.0140	1.009779999999999916	874.89800000000002	859.18200000000002	853.78800000000001	878.38599999999997	1.02881	1.14297	1.1568099999999999	0.0174	1.012110000000000117	2738.0500000000002	2507.5999999999999	2675.6100000000001	2534.9899999999998	0.94744300000000004	3.04183	2.9064899999999998	-0.0657	0.95550718	2145.8200000000002	1634.5799999999999	2097.0900000000001	1659.52	0.79134000000000004	2.2606999999999999	1.81107	-0.3199	0.8011110000000000219	254.72800000000001	236.48500000000001	247.56200000000001	248.06299999999999	1.0020199999999999	0.26707700000000001	0.26893099999999998	0.0100	1.006939999999999920	723.89800000000002	679.16399999999999	705.29200000000003	696.45699999999999	0.98747399999999996	0.88339100000000004	0.95049700000000004	0.1056	1.07596!sample_table_end
