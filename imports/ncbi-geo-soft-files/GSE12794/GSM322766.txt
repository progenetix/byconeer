Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322766/suppl/GSM322766.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	698.95600000000002	928.37800000000004	779.77700000000004	825.98800000000006	1.0592600000000001	1.6575	1.7523500000000001	0.0803	1.05722999999999992	3651.3499999999999	5550.9700000000003	4219.1499999999996	4716.0299999999997	1.1177699999999999	7.0030000000000001	8.1128199999999993	0.2122	1.158483	139.173	196.95099999999999	147.31200000000001	186.44800000000001	1.2656700000000001	0.22351299999999999	0.29250500000000001	0.3881	1.308674	10381	13885.799999999999	12090.6	11791.6	0.97527600000000003	21.753599999999999	22.250800000000002	0.0326	1.022855	188.876	159.267	202.583	152.91399999999999	0.75482199999999999	0.398926	0.32013999999999998	-0.3174	0.802506000000000056	125.244	163.333	131.958	156.51599999999999	1.18611	0.28193600000000002	0.34273300000000001	0.2817	1.21564000000000017	716.15599999999995	1077.6199999999999	799.428	954.01700000000005	1.19337	1.7526900000000001	2.0577100000000002	0.2315	1.17402999999999998	476.27600000000001	691.41800000000001	526.77700000000004	620.01999999999998	1.1770099999999999	0.86651400000000001	0.99741999999999997	0.2030	1.151079	1735.71	2210.7199999999998	1974.53	1915.6099999999999	0.97015600000000002	3.63733	3.4823599999999999	-0.0628	0.9573930000000000510	92.490399999999994	119.456	97.044200000000004	117.72799999999999	1.2131400000000001	0.16539999999999999	0.19856299999999999	0.2636	1.200499999999999911	223.48400000000001	256.524	241.55000000000001	239.13399999999999	0.99000100000000002	0.45144099999999998	0.45242700000000002	0.0031	1.002180000000000112	145.142	187.489	153.91900000000001	178.05099999999999	1.1567799999999999	0.30840699999999999	0.35814200000000002	0.2157	1.1612613	1223.26	1444.03	1380.8800000000001	1266.8	0.91738500000000001	2.5636999999999999	2.3967499999999999	-0.0972	0.9348769999999999614	1473.26	1729.95	1670.22	1509.55	0.90380499999999997	3.2003300000000001	2.9252699999999998	-0.1297	0.91405315	783.06700000000001	849.64400000000001	875.78800000000001	757.92100000000005	0.86541599999999996	1.6520900000000001	1.5528200000000001	-0.0894	0.9399159999999999716	1023.35	1284.8599999999999	1150.24	1130.98	0.98325300000000004	2.0064799999999998	1.9937100000000001	-0.0092	0.9936369999999999917	1473.26	1729.95	1670.22	1509.55	0.90380499999999997	3.2003300000000001	2.9252699999999998	-0.1297	0.91405318	1223.26	1444.03	1380.8800000000001	1266.8	0.91738500000000001	2.5636999999999999	2.3967499999999999	-0.0972	0.9348769999999999619	145.142	187.489	153.91900000000001	178.05099999999999	1.1567799999999999	0.30840699999999999	0.35814200000000002	0.2157	1.1612620	516.74199999999996	550.27099999999996	572.26499999999999	497.51600000000002	0.86938000000000004	1.2484500000000001	1.11025	-0.1693	0.88930100000000001!sample_table_end
