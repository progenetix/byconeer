Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322794/suppl/GSM322794.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	800.02200000000005	777.09299999999996	803.42499999999995	774.68499999999995	0.96422799999999997	0.92775799999999997	0.88381100000000001	-0.0700	0.952631000000000012	4922.9899999999998	7397.1899999999996	5106.3400000000001	6956.8800000000001	1.3624000000000001	6.0153400000000001	7.69231	0.3548	1.278783	221.404	187.83099999999999	200.81200000000001	210.185	1.04667	0.18642500000000001	0.199907	0.1007	1.07231999999999994	8053.9499999999998	8098.5299999999997	8383.3299999999999	7610.6300000000001	0.90782799999999997	8.2441999999999993	7.8837099999999998	-0.0645	0.956273000000000045	258.77800000000002	159.30199999999999	239.22200000000001	182.73599999999999	0.763876	0.239367	0.18701300000000001	-0.3561	0.781282999999999956	219.667	242.631	199.04499999999999	263.03500000000003	1.3214900000000001	0.21740499999999999	0.294207	0.4364	1.353277	1297.4300000000001	1642.6400000000001	1320.52	1596.23	1.20879	1.8502700000000001	2.14106	0.2106	1.157168	774.53300000000002	766.86699999999996	776.88400000000001	764.96299999999997	0.98465499999999995	0.83696999999999999	0.84070199999999995	0.0064	1.00445999999999999	2582.0599999999999	2559.77	2654.8899999999999	2458.46	0.92601299999999998	3.1520899999999998	2.81501	-0.1632	0.8930609999999999910	170.953	125.607	151.37700000000001	150.96299999999999	0.99726800000000004	0.192383	0.17843100000000001	-0.1086	0.92747711	347.13299999999998	274.57299999999998	331.54399999999998	293.59399999999999	0.88553499999999996	0.32298700000000002	0.29632900000000001	-0.1243	0.9174639999999999512	225.02799999999999	226.994	204.87	249.874	1.21967	0.26910699999999999	0.32242399999999999	0.2608	1.198120000000000113	2798.8200000000002	2632.5500000000002	2882.3299999999999	2526.5999999999999	0.876583	3.2954400000000001	2.9030800000000001	-0.1829	0.8809390000000000314	3801.4400000000001	4169.7799999999997	3927.6900000000001	3968.8899999999999	1.0104900000000001	4.6367799999999999	4.6998499999999996	0.0195	1.013600000000000115	1203.24	1120.2	1222	1100.95	0.90094200000000002	1.1876100000000001	1.14774	-0.0493	0.9664310000000000416	1951.6400000000001	2086.21	2000	2014.9000000000001	1.00745	2.2182499999999998	2.2606000000000002	0.0273	1.019090000000000117	3801.4400000000001	4169.7799999999997	3927.6900000000001	3968.8899999999999	1.0104900000000001	4.6367799999999999	4.6998499999999996	0.0195	1.013600000000000118	2798.8200000000002	2632.5500000000002	2882.3299999999999	2526.5999999999999	0.876583	3.2954400000000001	2.9030800000000001	-0.1829	0.8809390000000000319	225.02799999999999	226.994	204.87	249.874	1.21967	0.26910699999999999	0.32242399999999999	0.2608	1.198120000000000120	1431.05	1430.47	1459.78	1395.21	0.955766	1.4034599999999999	1.44608	0.0432	1.03037!sample_table_end
