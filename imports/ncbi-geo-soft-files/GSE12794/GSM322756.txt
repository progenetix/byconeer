Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322756/suppl/GSM322756.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2568.7600000000002	4097.5299999999997	2823.96	3667.6500000000001	1.2987599999999999	2.6821299999999999	3.3094600000000001	0.3032	1.23392	10621.4	12617	11596.5	11411.1	0.98401000000000005	9.0334000000000003	9.5273900000000005	0.0768	1.05468000000000013	207.03999999999999	171.35599999999999	212.42400000000001	176.81700000000001	0.83237899999999998	0.18675800000000001	0.16283700000000001	-0.1977	0.871917999999999974	16412.400000000001	16764.299999999999	17718.599999999999	15312.700000000001	0.86421700000000001	16.3033	14.699999999999999	-0.1493	0.901661000000000055	476.12400000000002	583.32000000000005	510.38799999999998	547.58000000000004	1.07287	0.41407100000000002	0.48062899999999997	0.2150	1.16074000000000016	290.69799999999998	371.20400000000001	304.38999999999999	357.76900000000001	1.17536	0.26863999999999999	0.32557900000000001	0.2773	1.21195000000000017	1931.71	3066.2199999999998	2123.0300000000002	2749.8299999999999	1.2952399999999999	2.34076	2.8181500000000002	0.2678	1.20395000000000018	1037.6500000000001	1278.3699999999999	1134.0699999999999	1164.72	1.0270300000000001	0.84009500000000004	0.924952	0.1388	1.101019	3282.2800000000002	4430.6099999999997	3610.02	3967.5999999999999	1.0990500000000001	3.1521300000000001	3.4188399999999999	0.1172	1.084619999999999910	137.73599999999999	142.244	137.80099999999999	149.55099999999999	1.08527	0.122722	0.13297200000000001	0.1157	1.083530000000000111	600.87599999999998	723.01800000000003	648.322	672.24599999999998	1.0368999999999999	0.50744299999999998	0.528949	0.0599	1.042380000000000112	310.00700000000001	480.86099999999999	325.67700000000002	455.76900000000001	1.3994500000000001	0.34936600000000001	0.46611599999999997	0.4160	1.334179999999999913	3074.4299999999998	3642.7600000000002	3382.3899999999999	3263.46	0.96483699999999994	3.1000000000000001	2.9458799999999998	-0.0736	0.9502840000000000214	3294.6100000000001	4217.8900000000003	3619.1100000000001	3784.96	1.04583	3.5342500000000001	3.68154	0.0589	1.041679999999999915	1286.71	1138.27	1410	1041.02	0.73831199999999997	1.4456800000000001	1.1327100000000001	-0.3520	0.7835159999999999916	2133.4400000000001	2453.3899999999999	2344.5100000000002	2207.23	0.94145000000000001	1.89154	1.8898600000000001	-0.0013	0.99911217	3294.6100000000001	4217.8900000000003	3619.1100000000001	3784.96	1.04583	3.5342500000000001	3.68154	0.0589	1.041679999999999918	3074.4299999999998	3642.7600000000002	3382.3899999999999	3263.46	0.96483699999999994	3.1000000000000001	2.9458799999999998	-0.0736	0.9502840000000000219	310.00700000000001	480.86099999999999	325.67700000000002	455.76900000000001	1.3994500000000001	0.34936600000000001	0.46611599999999997	0.4160	1.334179999999999920	1292.6400000000001	1685.6900000000001	1416.52	1526.75	1.07782	1.5955699999999999	1.7397899999999999	0.1248	1.09039!sample_table_end
