Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322895/suppl/GSM322895.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	628.57299999999998	861.54200000000003	685.47400000000005	800.41899999999998	1.1676899999999999	0.61276299999999995	0.71669099999999997	0.2260	1.16962	5675.8900000000003	7234.3299999999999	5810.2700000000004	7006.46	1.20587	4.9114699999999996	5.8906000000000001	0.2623	1.199363	324.36000000000001	419.60399999999998	386.88600000000002	346.81799999999998	0.89643399999999995	0.34337299999999998	0.30779400000000001	-0.1578	0.896383999999999964	16274.6	19603.599999999999	16716.599999999999	18995	1.1363000000000001	16.149699999999999	17.924399999999999	0.1504	1.109895	364.15600000000001	560.86699999999996	425.73200000000003	492.91699999999997	1.15781	0.37074499999999999	0.42153099999999999	0.1852	1.13698999999999996	282.596	460.37299999999999	345.87900000000002	389.04599999999999	1.1248100000000001	0.34244200000000002	0.377751	0.1416	1.103117	1997.8599999999999	1902.04	2048.3099999999999	1842.1199999999999	0.899335	1.8057099999999999	1.6364300000000001	-0.1420	0.906255999999999958	2669	3349.5500000000002	2727.6100000000001	3258.98	1.1948099999999999	2.3781599999999998	2.7744399999999998	0.2224	1.16663999999999999	3427.3200000000002	3506.0599999999999	3509.9400000000001	3399.0100000000002	0.96839399999999998	3.0071500000000002	2.9251900000000002	-0.0399	0.97274610	170.61500000000001	307.178	235.559	233.48599999999999	0.99119999999999997	0.18642900000000001	0.186862	0.0034	1.002329999999999911	513.44399999999996	672.66700000000003	572.38499999999999	607.71100000000001	1.06172	0.49076399999999998	0.50527699999999998	0.0420	1.029570000000000112	431.74099999999999	622.66399999999999	495.904	551.12599999999998	1.1113599999999999	0.42629	0.47770600000000002	0.1643	1.120610000000000113	3700.2600000000002	3995.5500000000002	3781.3299999999999	3885.4200000000001	1.0275300000000001	3.5091800000000002	3.56549	0.0230	1.016040000000000114	9554.7199999999993	9997.5400000000009	9822.25	9659.4799999999996	0.983429	8.8946699999999996	8.8411200000000001	-0.0087	0.9939799999999999715	1262.6800000000001	1368.52	1312.6099999999999	1311.0699999999999	0.99882899999999997	1.22431	1.2068099999999999	-0.0208	0.9857080000000000316	2114.7800000000002	2211.96	2168.29	2147.9200000000001	0.99060499999999996	2.0089399999999999	1.9610099999999999	-0.0348	0.9761410000000000417	9554.7199999999993	9997.5400000000009	9822.25	9659.4799999999996	0.983429	8.8946699999999996	8.8411200000000001	-0.0087	0.9939799999999999718	3700.2600000000002	3995.5500000000002	3781.3299999999999	3885.4200000000001	1.0275300000000001	3.5091800000000002	3.56549	0.0230	1.016040000000000119	431.74099999999999	622.66399999999999	495.904	551.12599999999998	1.1113599999999999	0.42629	0.47770600000000002	0.1643	1.120610000000000120	1356.3599999999999	1411.8	1405.8399999999999	1354.3399999999999	0.96336500000000003	1.38659	1.3490899999999999	-0.0396	0.97295399999999999!sample_table_end
