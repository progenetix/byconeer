Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320904/suppl/GSM320904.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1724	1518	1684.8100000000002	1548.5919000000001	0.91914929999999995	0.69495048999999998	0.67110274000000003	-0.0504	0.965684199999999992	2772	2841	2700.3942999999999	2890.6492000000003	1.0704545000000001	1.1538979	1.2605526999999999	0.1275	1.092433	1803	1649	1762.9643000000001	1681.5562	0.95382319999999998	0.71202472000000006	0.72847895000000007	0.0330	1.02310909999999994	10656	8351	10206.437	8526.7160999999996	0.83542530000000004	4.4233349999999998	3.8396295	-0.2042	0.868039499999999965	9954	10881	9546.0727000000006	11127.841	1.1656983000000001	4.1237589999999997	5.1650809999999998	0.3248	1.25251766	6012	5338	5811.2061000000003	5449.4739	0.93775260000000005	2.5884706999999998	2.6075543999999997	0.0106	1.00737260000000017	1923	2063	1881.4738	2105.9331999999999	1.1192998000000001	0.86803408000000004	1.0907035	0.3294	1.25652159999999998	1673	1706	1634.3877	1739.8954000000001	1.0645549000000001	0.78381898000000005	0.83668107000000003	0.0942	1.06744179	2610	2643	2545.1496000000002	2690.4360000000001	1.0570837	1.0046031	1.0698684000000001	0.0908	1.064966210	7522	7743	7252.9322000000002	7900.4966000000004	1.0892831000000001	4.0480874	4.0553942999999997	0.0026	1.001805000000000111	6758	6659	6523.7152000000006	6794.5907999999999	1.0415217000000001	3.3768072	3.3381966999999997	-0.0166	0.9885660000000000612	7170	5908	6917.6157000000003	6030.3784000000005	0.87174229999999997	3.5911499999999998	3.1898181999999999	-0.1710	0.8882442000000000413	1554	1835	1517.6694	1873.6900000000001	1.2345838	0.92865153	1.0086128999999999	0.1192	1.086104814	8985	7704	8635.4249	7860.7995000000001	0.91029680000000002	3.7118319999999998	3.4986329999999999	-0.0853	0.9425623000000000815	1538	1441	1502.4311	1472.5441000000001	0.98010759999999997	0.73225119000000005	0.70027837999999998	-0.0644	0.9563363000000000316	1718	2020	1678.8747000000001	2062.4492	1.2284712	0.79447434000000006	1.0382259999999999	0.3860	1.306808699999999917	642	639	640.99017000000003	660.83396000000005	1.030958	0.28007390999999998	0.29547790000000002	0.0772	1.054999718	3124	2805	3047.0982000000004	2853.8881000000001	0.93659210000000004	1.2801654	1.2828192999999999	0.0030	1.002073119	1457	1350	1425.3833	1383.2883000000002	0.97046750000000004	0.64788699000000005	0.62243645999999997	-0.0578	0.9607176000000000620	1722	1587	1682.8308000000002	1618.2499	0.96162369999999997	0.94905442000000007	0.81399423999999998	-0.2215	0.8576897!sample_table_end
