Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320906/suppl/GSM320906.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1279	1297	1283.0408	1293.5712000000001	1.0082074000000001	0.66072544	0.67764714999999998	0.0365	1.02561079999999992	2106	2395	2105.1109000000001	2389.3329000000003	1.1350152	1.1777587999999999	1.3155995999999999	0.1597	1.11703653	1083	997	1086.3038000000001	995.4495300000001	0.91636379999999995	0.62358391999999996	0.59467175999999999	-0.0685	0.953635499999999974	7726	6613	7623.8760000000002	6615.2097000000003	0.86769640000000003	4.1793205999999996	3.8048476999999998	-0.1354	0.910398600000000065	8817	9859	8687.4806000000008	9881.3678	1.1374261999999999	6.1406842999999993	7.2492288999999994	0.2394	1.18052466	5532	4771	5483.0875000000005	4762.1719000000003	0.86852010000000002	3.4465291999999996	3.1290420999999999	-0.1394	0.907882100000000037	1359	1565	1362.0528000000002	1560.1223	1.1454199	0.92446784000000004	1.1473742	0.3116	1.24111859999999988	1683	1697	1683.6904000000002	1691.9648	1.0049144000000001	0.92583491000000007	0.93332959000000004	0.0116	1.00809519	1496	1723	1499.0806	1717.8072000000002	1.1459071999999999	0.78706668000000002	0.88161294000000001	0.1637	1.120124799999999910	5370	5479	5324.3133000000007	5474.0695999999998	1.0281269	3.4622356999999999	3.3514699999999999	-0.0469	0.9680075000000000211	5886	5959	5827.5556999999999	5957.9742000000006	1.0223796000000001	3.4373272999999998	3.4068016999999999	-0.0129	0.9911193999999999812	5926	5195	5866.4380000000001	5188.7289000000001	0.88447690000000001	3.5050032999999998	3.1896090999999998	-0.1360	0.9100160000000000513	1553	1925	1555.8321000000001	1918.8954000000001	1.2333563999999999	0.85528944000000007	1.009099	0.2386	1.179833399999999914	8367	7809	8252.7124000000003	7814.2637000000004	0.94687220000000005	5.0486383999999997	4.6795342999999994	-0.1095	0.926890415	1218	1247	1222.7318	1244.5499	1.0178437	0.63430803000000002	0.65721254000000007	0.0512	1.036109416	1123	1575	1126.8873000000001	1570.1662000000001	1.3933658	0.66549886000000003	0.96792995999999998	0.5405	1.454442717	320	367	321.73367000000002	373.75364000000002	1.1616864	0.18305389999999999	0.20964413000000001	0.1957	1.14525918	2282	2043	2278.5360000000001	2036.9829000000002	0.89398759999999999	1.3969970999999999	1.2924479	-0.1122	0.9251614999999999719	848	914	852.23868000000004	913.92547000000002	1.0723821	0.46985893000000001	0.49019215999999999	0.0611	1.043275199999999820	1271	1208	1275.1813	1206.1792	0.94588839999999996	0.75340985000000005	0.65843629000000004	-0.1944	0.87394170000000004!sample_table_end
