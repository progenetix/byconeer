Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322885/suppl/GSM322885.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	992.02200000000005	1220.1300000000001	1030.22	1187.3399999999999	1.1525099999999999	0.732707	0.86878100000000003	0.2458	1.185712	3634.7600000000002	4562.0200000000004	3501.3000000000002	4693.1800000000003	1.3404100000000001	3.6762000000000001	4.5678299999999998	0.3133	1.242543	276.48899999999998	570.88900000000001	355.57499999999999	487.88099999999997	1.37209	0.28467599999999998	0.34161900000000001	0.2631	1.20002999999999994	8758.1499999999996	9834.5599999999995	8318.1599999999999	10120.700000000001	1.2166999999999999	6.6930500000000004	7.0480099999999997	0.0745	1.05302999999999995	257.24900000000002	510.68400000000003	336.964	421.98899999999998	1.2523299999999999	0.32460499999999998	0.35654999999999998	0.1354	1.09841000000000016	304.31599999999997	406.84399999999999	382.291	312.38099999999997	0.81712799999999997	0.32137300000000002	0.24584800000000001	-0.3865	0.764993000000000037	3376.4299999999998	2692.6199999999999	3259.2800000000002	2746.3800000000001	0.84263299999999997	2.2844799999999998	2.0546000000000002	-0.1530	0.899372999999999988	3619.6700000000001	3146.6599999999999	3487.1799999999998	3223.54	0.92439899999999997	2.903	2.6657700000000002	-0.1230	0.918281000000000019	5658.3699999999999	4949.8500000000004	5415.8699999999999	5071.25	0.93636799999999998	4.0992800000000003	4.00962	-0.0319	0.9781290000000000310	88.131399999999999	274.18200000000002	165.05699999999999	200.554	1.21506	0.131134	0.16400999999999999	0.3227	1.250699999999999911	121.929	381.25799999999998	202.691	287.10199999999998	1.41645	0.13018399999999999	0.18387200000000001	0.4981	1.4123912	1003.5700000000001	1042.1099999999999	1047.97	989.39999999999998	0.94411100000000003	0.70829500000000001	0.71482599999999996	0.0132	1.0092213	7099.0799999999999	5876.9799999999996	6763.5	6045.8500000000004	0.89389300000000005	5.2505100000000002	4.60907	-0.1880	0.8778329999999999714	14752.6	13467.4	13951.200000000001	13907.1	0.99684200000000001	11.057	10.8573	-0.0263	0.9819360000000000315	1352.3199999999999	1529.5899999999999	1366.76	1516.8900000000001	1.10985	1.1771799999999999	1.1108199999999999	-0.0837	0.9436280000000000216	2710.25	2526.0999999999999	2636.6199999999999	2570.4499999999998	0.97490200000000005	2.40985	2.2745299999999999	-0.0834	0.9438480000000000217	14752.6	13467.4	13951.200000000001	13907.1	0.99684200000000001	11.057	10.8573	-0.0263	0.9819360000000000318	7099.0799999999999	5876.9799999999996	6763.5	6045.8500000000004	0.89389300000000005	5.2505100000000002	4.60907	-0.1880	0.8778329999999999719	1003.5700000000001	1042.1099999999999	1047.97	989.39999999999998	0.94411100000000003	0.70829500000000001	0.71482599999999996	0.0132	1.0092220	2721.98	2707.6199999999999	2646.5100000000002	2762.1900000000001	1.0437099999999999	2.2454700000000001	2.0433400000000002	-0.1361	0.90998500000000004!sample_table_end
