Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320910/suppl/GSM320910.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1856	1685	1924.1409000000001	1613.7175	0.83866909999999995	0.81135168000000002	0.73587336000000003	-0.1409	0.906972100000000062	1189	1210	1239.2191	1165.0933	0.9401834	0.65844316000000003	0.63117504000000002	-0.0610	0.958586999999999973	1573	1565	1628.3691000000001	1498.3053	0.92012629999999995	0.80773901000000004	0.77656528000000002	-0.0568	0.961406199999999994	7451	6974	7590.6633000000002	6632.9484000000002	0.87382990000000005	4.8382620999999997	4.4177944	-0.1312	0.913095300000000055	11145	12811	11237.097	12213.98	1.0869338	5.5131722999999999	6.5170553999999994	0.2413	1.18208809999999996	4930	5880	5062.1797999999999	5593.3117000000002	1.1049215999999999	2.4876497999999998	3.0619348999999998	0.2997	1.23085457	1338	1694	1392.3584000000001	1622.4539	1.1652559	0.85575825999999999	1.0681148	0.3198	1.24815009999999998	973	1456	1016.5841	1396.3803	1.3736003000000001	0.68521311000000007	0.87610926	0.3546	1.27859379999999999	1980	2090	2052.8661999999999	2001.1917000000001	0.97482809999999998	1.0031474	0.99475332999999999	-0.0121	0.9916323000000000210	6535	7651	6675.1986999999999	7275.7177000000001	1.0899627000000001	5.9842873999999995	5.5570677999999996	-0.1069	0.9286098000000000411	5505	6345	5640.0360000000001	6033.1453000000001	1.0696998	4.6019513999999999	4.4794403999999997	-0.0389	0.9733785000000000412	5672	5451	5808.5077000000001	5190.0751	0.89352989999999999	4.0223722999999998	3.6726009999999998	-0.1312	0.9130435000000000113	1158	1541	1207.3076000000001	1475.4905000000001	1.2221331	1.2433440999999998	1.3628359999999999	0.1324	1.096105300000000114	8191	7955	8324.104800000001	7563.616	0.90864020000000001	4.6576711	4.1935592999999995	-0.1514	0.9003554000000000315	1614	1553	1670.8691000000001	1486.8977	0.88989479999999999	1.1367981	0.96943226000000005	-0.2298	0.8527742999999999916	1326	1559	1380.1093000000001	1492.6020000000001	1.08151	0.92320751000000001	1.0330759	0.1622	1.119007217	468	542	495.10039000000006	532.5829	1.0757068999999999	0.26263130000000001	0.28307939999999998	0.1082	1.077858599999999918	3605	3699	3718.5085000000004	3516.2711000000004	0.94561329999999999	1.4335123999999999	1.5410431	0.1044	1.075011999999999919	1540	1459	1595.3704	1399.1536000000001	0.87700860000000003	0.86675342	0.76489143999999998	-0.1804	0.8824787000000000620	1101	1309	1148.0797	1258.7160000000001	1.0963664	0.83470034999999998	0.76108249000000006	-0.1332	0.91180320000000004!sample_table_end
