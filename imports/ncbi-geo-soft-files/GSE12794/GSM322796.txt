Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322796/suppl/GSM322796.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	583.822	532.49800000000005	573.17399999999998	544.68100000000004	0.95028900000000005	0.63417999999999997	0.61677499999999996	-0.0401	0.972555999999999982	5329.4499999999998	4271.8800000000001	5307.2799999999997	4188.1499999999996	0.789134	9.3409700000000004	7.2513199999999998	-0.3653	0.776291999999999983	212.667	175.06700000000001	202.61500000000001	188.34	0.92954499999999995	0.217915	0.21113699999999999	-0.0456	0.968895999999999984	9863.3299999999999	9304.1200000000008	9796.7700000000004	9114.8799999999992	0.930396	10.706200000000001	10.8614	0.0208	1.01455	145.71100000000001	168.00899999999999	137.76400000000001	181.22800000000001	1.31549	0.20297299999999999	0.264208	0.3804	1.301696	184.93799999999999	176.489	175.352	189.774	1.0822400000000001	0.22908200000000001	0.245057	0.0972	1.06973000000000017	1446.05	1985.9200000000001	1433.8199999999999	1969.8900000000001	1.37388	1.6091800000000001	2.2272400000000001	0.4689	1.384088	517.60000000000002	625.77800000000002	507.04000000000002	637.59500000000003	1.2574799999999999	0.78391699999999997	0.930724	0.2476	1.187279	2335.6300000000001	2213.0500000000002	2321.23	2190.1900000000001	0.94354800000000005	2.94225	2.7264599999999999	-0.1099	0.9266590000000000110	129.179	125.258	122.54600000000001	138.26599999999999	1.1282799999999999	0.15728200000000001	0.174539	0.1502	1.1097211	392.858	487.822	382.505	500.58199999999999	1.3087	0.40105400000000002	0.52336499999999997	0.3840	1.3049712	278.59500000000003	273.25999999999999	268.04599999999999	286.94600000000003	1.0705100000000001	0.299985	0.32688	0.1239	1.0896513	3714.3699999999999	2661.29	3693.71	2633.9299999999998	0.71308499999999997	4.2067899999999998	3.0419399999999999	-0.4677	0.7231009999999999914	3433.8699999999999	2844.6700000000001	3414.77	2806.9499999999998	0.82200200000000001	4.2232700000000003	3.5439400000000001	-0.2530	0.8391450000000000315	1878.4400000000001	1284	1864.8800000000001	1285.98	0.68957900000000005	2.0998000000000001	1.6206	-0.3737	0.7717859999999999716	1206.9300000000001	1297.8	1195.3900000000001	1299.49	1.08708	1.9275199999999999	1.9863200000000001	0.0433	1.030517	3433.8699999999999	2844.6700000000001	3414.77	2806.9499999999998	0.82200200000000001	4.2232700000000003	3.5439400000000001	-0.2530	0.8391450000000000318	3714.3699999999999	2661.29	3693.71	2633.9299999999998	0.71308499999999997	4.2067899999999998	3.0419399999999999	-0.4677	0.7231009999999999919	278.59500000000003	273.25999999999999	268.04599999999999	286.94600000000003	1.0705100000000001	0.299985	0.32688	0.1239	1.0896520	1147.5799999999999	1010.62	1136.01	1017.37	0.89556199999999997	1.3815500000000001	1.3838900000000001	0.0024	1.00169!sample_table_end
