Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322762/suppl/GSM322762.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	410.11099999999999	405.916	435.89699999999999	392.15199999999999	0.899644	0.62160800000000005	0.53894500000000001	-0.2059	0.867018999999999982	9106.5799999999999	9816.1900000000005	9564.9599999999991	8818.9899999999998	0.92201	10.965	9.8443000000000005	-0.1555	0.897795000000000013	236.99600000000001	259.27600000000001	245.70699999999999	260.67700000000002	1.0609299999999999	0.22816500000000001	0.29425600000000002	0.3670	1.289664	8036.9200000000001	8644.6100000000006	8385.0400000000009	7760.6099999999997	0.92552999999999996	8.2129799999999999	8.83474	0.1053	1.07570000000000015	381.55599999999998	325.88900000000001	404.68099999999998	320.36900000000003	0.79165700000000006	0.40623300000000001	0.36541099999999999	-0.1528	0.899510999999999956	354.75999999999999	377.48399999999998	375.20600000000002	366.68700000000001	0.977294	0.43978499999999998	0.47675699999999999	0.1165	1.08407000000000017	923.16399999999999	1145.98	990.94000000000005	1052.95	1.0625800000000001	1.6408199999999999	1.4936	-0.1356	0.910275999999999978	532.50699999999995	821.37800000000004	570.38900000000001	763.35199999999998	1.3383	0.64091699999999996	0.89241300000000001	0.4776	1.39240000000000019	2334.2600000000002	2226.96	2468.0900000000001	2016.47	0.81701599999999996	3.1639400000000002	2.3836499999999998	-0.4086	0.7533779999999999910	176.58699999999999	168.65700000000001	183.12299999999999	180.048	0.983205	0.25869500000000001	0.214397	-0.2710	0.8287639999999999511	174	147.39099999999999	180.559	160.93799999999999	0.89133200000000001	0.19897500000000001	0.189523	-0.0702	0.9524989999999999812	278.43400000000003	273.36799999999999	291.11799999999999	273.51400000000001	0.93952999999999998	0.44855400000000001	0.38329200000000002	-0.2268	0.8545059999999999913	1690.29	1819.74	1796.8900000000001	1657.3099999999999	0.92231700000000005	2.3129599999999999	2.2039	-0.0697	0.9528489999999999514	1707.6300000000001	2162.6700000000001	1814.52	1959.02	1.0796300000000001	2.2709299999999999	2.5327099999999998	0.1574	1.1152815	725.57299999999998	450.18200000000002	779.32799999999997	431.74799999999999	0.55400099999999997	0.74304300000000001	0.49769200000000002	-0.5782	0.6698030000000000416	1041.6500000000001	959.77700000000004	1115.49	887.423	0.795547	1.2854099999999999	1.10697	-0.2156	0.8611750000000000217	1707.6300000000001	2162.6700000000001	1814.52	1959.02	1.0796300000000001	2.2709299999999999	2.5327099999999998	0.1574	1.1152818	1690.29	1819.74	1796.8900000000001	1657.3099999999999	0.92231700000000005	2.3129599999999999	2.2039	-0.0697	0.9528489999999999519	278.43400000000003	273.36799999999999	291.11799999999999	273.51400000000001	0.93952999999999998	0.44855400000000001	0.38329200000000002	-0.2268	0.8545059999999999920	1504.97	1733.04	1603.3699999999999	1575.29	0.98248800000000003	1.62626	1.81412	0.1577	1.1155200000000001!sample_table_end
