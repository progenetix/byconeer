Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322893/suppl/GSM322893.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2057.4400000000001	2001.6900000000001	2110.0999999999999	1933.5799999999999	0.91634300000000002	1.6802900000000001	1.5164	-0.1481	0.902464000000000042	5877.5100000000002	6807.71	5876.8199999999997	6759.8000000000002	1.15025	5.8482500000000002	6.6947200000000002	0.1950	1.14474000000000013	255.40000000000001	474.089	328.76900000000001	388.11700000000002	1.18052	0.26315	0.31208999999999998	0.2461	1.185984	14157.5	14110.1	13841.4	14282.9	1.03189	11.114000000000001	11.4962	0.0488	1.03438999999999995	352.11599999999999	518.26199999999994	425.685	433.048	1.01729	0.36155500000000002	0.35973899999999998	-0.0073	0.994978000000000036	310.02199999999999	460.267	383.77999999999997	373.97800000000001	0.97445800000000005	0.322824	0.30697000000000002	-0.0727	0.950887999999999967	4399.2200000000003	5598.4399999999996	4422.2299999999996	5543.3400000000001	1.25352	3.5842399999999999	4.4978999999999996	0.3276	1.254918	4535.1800000000003	5533.6700000000001	4556.3299999999999	5478.3000000000002	1.20235	3.7814700000000001	4.5458999999999996	0.2656	1.20215000000000019	6550.8199999999997	6588.8299999999999	6537.6899999999996	6538.3599999999997	1.0001	5.3862699999999997	5.4193800000000003	0.0088	1.006150000000000110	107.038	228.142	175.875	161.202	0.91657500000000003	0.150029	0.13925999999999999	-0.1075	0.9282230000000000211	633.97799999999995	701.77800000000002	705.33000000000004	620.51099999999997	0.879745	0.51204099999999997	0.437222	-0.2279	0.8538799999999999712	599.42899999999997	808.74199999999996	673.05799999999999	725.43499999999995	1.07782	0.54745999999999995	0.58054399999999995	0.0846	1.0604313	6349.7299999999996	6516.6499999999996	6339.2700000000004	6469.0299999999997	1.02047	5.2352800000000004	5.23611	0.0002	1.000159999999999914	11564.4	10585.5	11378.200000000001	10616.299999999999	0.93303800000000003	9.3795800000000007	8.7478700000000007	-0.1006	0.9326510000000000115	2064.0700000000002	1918.74	2116.6500000000001	1849.8900000000001	0.873973	1.7851999999999999	1.5810900000000001	-0.1752	0.8856640000000000116	2449.6900000000001	2177.4400000000001	2499.6100000000001	2110.0300000000002	0.84414299999999998	2.1984499999999998	1.8348	-0.2609	0.8345890000000000317	11564.4	10585.5	11378.200000000001	10616.299999999999	0.93303800000000003	9.3795800000000007	8.7478700000000007	-0.1006	0.9326510000000000118	6349.7299999999996	6516.6499999999996	6339.2700000000004	6469.0299999999997	1.02047	5.2352800000000004	5.23611	0.0002	1.000159999999999919	599.42899999999997	808.74199999999996	673.05799999999999	725.43499999999995	1.07782	0.54745999999999995	0.58054399999999995	0.0846	1.0604320	1557.8099999999999	2095.0999999999999	1618.1600000000001	2027.8199999999999	1.2531699999999999	1.4135800000000001	1.79603	0.3455	1.2705599999999999!sample_table_end
