Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322806/suppl/GSM322806.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	748.03999999999996	714.37800000000004	759.68499999999995	702.53300000000002	0.92476800000000003	1.05565	0.99223099999999997	-0.0894	0.939926000000000042	4624.4700000000003	5510.1099999999997	4753.9799999999996	5220.25	1.0980799999999999	7.1283099999999999	7.3414099999999998	0.0425	1.029893	185.489	150.96000000000001	181.572	159.233	0.876969	0.22911400000000001	0.21371899999999999	-0.1004	0.9328054	8520.4899999999998	7989.3199999999997	8733.2399999999998	7587	0.86875000000000002	11.436199999999999	10.5869	-0.1113	0.925737999999999955	271.15100000000001	261.42200000000003	267.50099999999998	268.46100000000001	1.00359	0.33467000000000002	0.34487800000000002	0.0433	1.03056	228.21299999999999	222.40000000000001	224.00999999999999	230.107	1.02722	0.31676199999999999	0.327573	0.0484	1.034137	1030.6199999999999	1136.6400000000001	1053.05	1099.23	1.0438499999999999	1.6643600000000001	1.7606200000000001	0.0811	1.05783999999999998	521.84900000000005	697.08900000000006	524.90499999999997	686.21600000000001	1.30731	0.909833	1.1186799999999999	0.2981	1.22954000000000019	2493.02	2676.2399999999998	2561.8699999999999	2547.9499999999998	0.99456500000000003	3.6360100000000002	3.5586099999999998	-0.0310	0.9787130000000000610	183.547	152.97900000000001	179.83699999999999	161.44900000000001	0.89775099999999997	0.28221200000000002	0.23802699999999999	-0.2457	0.8434310000000000411	220.62200000000001	163.756	216.39099999999999	171.89500000000001	0.79437400000000002	0.269372	0.21826499999999999	-0.3035	0.8102740000000000512	232.57400000000001	251.04599999999999	229.816	258.30099999999999	1.12395	0.33638699999999999	0.38712600000000003	0.2027	1.150840000000000113	2417.98	2022.03	2485.5	1937.4400000000001	0.77949500000000005	3.6103200000000002	2.88707	-0.3225	0.7996710000000000214	1470.8900000000001	1465.4100000000001	1506.9200000000001	1411.52	0.936693	2.2540300000000002	2.1295500000000001	-0.0820	0.9447750000000000315	516.57799999999997	371.49299999999999	519.452	375.31900000000002	0.72252899999999998	0.75231000000000003	0.58790799999999999	-0.3557	0.7814710000000000316	445.67599999999999	380.322	446.40100000000001	383.90199999999999	0.85999400000000004	0.75695699999999999	0.62428899999999998	-0.2780	0.8247360000000000217	1470.8900000000001	1465.4100000000001	1506.9200000000001	1411.52	0.936693	2.2540300000000002	2.1295500000000001	-0.0820	0.9447750000000000318	2417.98	2022.03	2485.5	1937.4400000000001	0.77949500000000005	3.6103200000000002	2.88707	-0.3225	0.7996710000000000219	232.57400000000001	251.04599999999999	229.816	258.30099999999999	1.12395	0.33638699999999999	0.38712600000000003	0.2027	1.150840000000000120	873.42200000000003	918.09299999999996	889.56299999999999	895.25099999999998	1.0063899999999999	1.4824299999999999	1.62043	0.1284	1.0930899999999999!sample_table_end
