Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322914/suppl/GSM322914.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	996.12	1213.1600000000001	1086.75	1111.6300000000001	1.0228900000000001	1.01569	1.0118499999999999	-0.0055	0.996215999999999992	13081.5	14796.799999999999	13973.799999999999	13673.1	0.97848199999999996	9.2262299999999993	9.5730199999999996	0.0532	1.037593	232.62200000000001	295.733	246.65100000000001	282.61399999999998	1.1457999999999999	0.18435799999999999	0.206346	0.1626	1.119274	17876.400000000001	18166	18800.200000000001	16947.099999999999	0.90142999999999995	12.422800000000001	12.064500000000001	-0.0422	0.971152000000000025	395.31599999999997	386.69299999999998	425.40199999999999	365.04300000000001	0.85811099999999996	0.30432999999999999	0.26589400000000002	-0.1948	0.873703000000000016	466.68900000000002	512	504.09500000000003	478.73200000000003	0.94968699999999995	0.42208400000000001	0.40842299999999998	-0.0475	0.967636000000000057	2695.3299999999999	2750.2199999999998	2952.23	2491.29	0.84386700000000003	2.9311400000000001	2.42001	-0.2765	0.825617999999999968	1006.73	1397.8099999999999	1098.4100000000001	1277.6500000000001	1.1631800000000001	0.77191699999999996	0.95423599999999997	0.3059	1.23618999999999999	2272.1700000000001	2584.27	2488.1999999999998	2342.5999999999999	0.94148399999999999	2.03668	1.9290799999999999	-0.0783	0.9471720000000000110	182.86000000000001	184.86500000000001	192.453	181.63900000000001	0.94381199999999998	0.15942300000000001	0.14649400000000001	-0.1220	0.9189000000000000511	120.711	116.578	125.38500000000001	118.58199999999999	0.94574800000000003	0.100082	0.095326300000000003	-0.0702	0.9524829999999999712	428.19499999999999	484.87700000000001	461.017	454.25400000000002	0.98533099999999996	0.42415900000000001	0.39860200000000001	-0.0897	0.9397450000000000513	3576.3400000000001	3842.6900000000001	3909.7199999999998	3482.02	0.89060600000000001	3.3691499999999999	2.95268	-0.1904	0.87638614	2480.2399999999998	3391.0100000000002	2714.4099999999999	3073.4899999999998	1.13228	2.3323299999999998	2.5759699999999999	0.1433	1.1044615	1040.3800000000001	1062.55	1135.6800000000001	975.86800000000005	0.85928199999999999	0.79688199999999998	0.72588399999999997	-0.1346	0.9109049999999999616	1289.3599999999999	1425.6600000000001	1410.0699999999999	1302.55	0.92374699999999998	1.04688	1.0285500000000001	-0.0255	0.98248317	2480.2399999999998	3391.0100000000002	2714.4099999999999	3073.4899999999998	1.13228	2.3323299999999998	2.5759699999999999	0.1433	1.1044618	3576.3400000000001	3842.6900000000001	3909.7199999999998	3482.02	0.89060600000000001	3.3691499999999999	2.95268	-0.1904	0.87638619	428.19499999999999	484.87700000000001	461.017	454.25400000000002	0.98533099999999996	0.42415900000000001	0.39860200000000001	-0.0897	0.9397450000000000520	2420.5799999999999	3543.4200000000001	2649.8299999999999	3203.1700000000001	1.20882	1.9835100000000001	2.3214800000000002	0.2270	1.17039!sample_table_end
