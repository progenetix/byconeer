Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322808/suppl/GSM322808.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1835.3299999999999	1885.1800000000001	1807.3099999999999	1892.76	1.04728	1.77258	1.8622399999999999	0.0712	1.05058000000000012	6760.3100000000004	6747.6400000000003	6667.7799999999997	6727.4499999999998	1.00895	9.4878099999999996	9.7222000000000008	0.0352	1.02469999999999993	182.578	133.511	174.333	145.01599999999999	0.83183600000000002	0.17061399999999999	0.150369	-0.1822	0.881344000000000024	13995	11969.4	13695.5	12050.4	0.87988100000000002	15.769399999999999	14.8483	-0.0868	0.941586999999999955	402.15600000000001	389.77800000000002	389.77699999999999	405.42200000000003	1.0401400000000001	0.460337	0.50465499999999996	0.1326	1.09627000000000016	294.60399999999998	311.80000000000001	284.07900000000001	326.52699999999999	1.1494200000000001	0.29338799999999998	0.34969899999999998	0.2533	1.19192999999999997	1788.76	2294.8899999999999	1761.24	2297.2399999999998	1.30433	2.0033500000000002	2.4557899999999999	0.2938	1.225848	786.26700000000005	932.37300000000005	769.55399999999997	948.72799999999995	1.2328300000000001	0.95094599999999996	1.1825600000000001	0.3145	1.243569	3543.4899999999998	3425.6799999999998	3495.0300000000002	3416.5500000000002	0.977545	4.09633	3.8943099999999999	-0.0730	0.9506820000000000310	111.066	108.97	105.39400000000001	119.742	1.1361399999999999	0.125975	0.13350300000000001	0.0837	1.0597611	87.421999999999997	79.475999999999999	82.833799999999997	88.965000000000003	1.07402	0.076451099999999994	0.083740899999999993	0.1314	1.0953512	653.80999999999995	774.85400000000004	638.49099999999999	792.06600000000003	1.2405299999999999	0.65710000000000002	0.79500099999999996	0.2748	1.209859999999999913	4919.4200000000001	4259.4899999999998	4853.8900000000003	4251	0.87579099999999999	4.7297500000000001	4.2464599999999999	-0.1555	0.8978190000000000314	2908.5799999999999	2644.6100000000001	2866.1700000000001	2644.8899999999999	0.92279500000000003	3.26641	3.0553599999999999	-0.0964	0.9353850000000000215	449.80000000000001	432.22199999999998	436.81099999999998	448.13200000000001	1.0259199999999999	0.64500100000000005	0.705094	0.1285	1.0931716	930.48299999999995	924.50400000000002	911.77099999999996	941.26800000000003	1.0323500000000001	1.2026399999999999	1.2569300000000001	0.0637	1.0451417	2908.5799999999999	2644.6100000000001	2866.1700000000001	2644.8899999999999	0.92279500000000003	3.26641	3.0553599999999999	-0.0964	0.9353850000000000218	4919.4200000000001	4259.4899999999998	4853.8900000000003	4251	0.87579099999999999	4.7297500000000001	4.2464599999999999	-0.1555	0.8978190000000000319	653.80999999999995	774.85400000000004	638.49099999999999	792.06600000000003	1.2405299999999999	0.65710000000000002	0.79500099999999996	0.2748	1.209859999999999920	1387.8199999999999	1253.9300000000001	1363.29	1268.47	0.93044800000000005	2.03599	2.1307800000000001	0.0657	1.0465599999999999!sample_table_end
