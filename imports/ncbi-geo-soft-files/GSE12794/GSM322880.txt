Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322880/suppl/GSM322880.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	505.173	641.77800000000002	485.81999999999999	656.58699999999999	1.3514999999999999	0.84143299999999999	1.1231	0.4166	1.33475000000000012	7057	9336.6700000000001	7131.6800000000003	9031.8999999999996	1.2664500000000001	8.2084899999999994	10.325699999999999	0.3310	1.25791999999999993	192.23599999999999	119.35599999999999	165.64099999999999	149.416	0.90204499999999999	0.17909800000000001	0.18629999999999999	0.0569	1.04021000000000014	12230.9	11810.9	12099.200000000001	11623.799999999999	0.96070599999999995	11.414099999999999	12.9682	0.1842	1.136155	405.71600000000001	279.88900000000001	384.18900000000002	306.25999999999999	0.79715899999999995	0.40378199999999997	0.35658099999999998	-0.1793	0.883102999999999976	247.18199999999999	172.29300000000001	221.53	201.197	0.90821300000000005	0.32098399999999999	0.29948599999999997	-0.1000	0.933027000000000057	907.80899999999997	1095.75	891.69399999999996	1090.0599999999999	1.2224600000000001	1.8921699999999999	2.30017	0.2817	1.215638	904.90200000000004	841.28899999999999	888.81200000000001	848.375	0.95450500000000005	1.17211	1.05321	-0.1543	0.898561000000000059	2179.6199999999999	2123.6700000000001	2170.4000000000001	2065.8299999999999	0.95181800000000005	3.47987	3.1920500000000001	-0.1245	0.91729210	172.762	108.877	148.65799999999999	139.179	0.93623400000000001	0.243506	0.22370499999999999	-0.1224	0.9186839999999999511	437.822	233.702	416.36599999999999	261.05700000000002	0.62698900000000002	0.57855599999999996	0.36792599999999998	-0.6530	0.63593812	272.94	233.97499999999999	247.678	261.62599999999998	1.0563100000000001	0.47948099999999999	0.50911099999999998	0.0865	1.061800000000000113	2098.3299999999999	1885.26	2091.29	1836.77	0.87829400000000002	3.3197800000000002	3.05891	-0.1181	0.9214179999999999614	2358.4899999999998	2235.6199999999999	2350.5500000000002	2179.23	0.92711600000000005	3.5861900000000002	3.47498	-0.0454	0.9689910000000000515	684.173	581.42200000000003	666.51800000000003	598.25199999999995	0.89757799999999999	0.71082599999999996	0.77105500000000005	0.1173	1.0847316	1281.9100000000001	1002.09	1267.6600000000001	1001.92	0.79037000000000002	1.7036100000000001	1.34758	-0.3382	0.7910139999999999917	2358.4899999999998	2235.6199999999999	2350.5500000000002	2179.23	0.92711600000000005	3.5861900000000002	3.47498	-0.0454	0.9689910000000000518	2098.3299999999999	1885.26	2091.29	1836.77	0.87829400000000002	3.3197800000000002	3.05891	-0.1181	0.9214179999999999619	272.94	233.97499999999999	247.678	261.62599999999998	1.0563100000000001	0.47948099999999999	0.50911099999999998	0.0865	1.061800000000000120	1753.05	1579.3599999999999	1742.5699999999999	1549.05	0.88894899999999999	2.0473699999999999	2.1418300000000001	0.0651	1.0461400000000001!sample_table_end
