Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322918/suppl/GSM322918.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	673.46699999999998	582.08399999999995	633.00599999999997	623.14599999999996	0.98442300000000005	0.60165500000000005	0.61139699999999997	0.0232	1.01618999999999992	7462.1199999999999	7545.04	7320.0900000000001	7462.5200000000004	1.01946	5.6542700000000004	5.6591199999999997	0.0012	1.00086000000000013	265.67099999999999	182.791	239.49600000000001	214.87899999999999	0.89721200000000001	0.20943700000000001	0.15856999999999999	-0.4014	0.757122999999999994	6402.0699999999997	7445.0200000000004	6279.4300000000003	7364.9799999999996	1.1728700000000001	5.4020000000000001	5.6473899999999997	0.0641	1.045425	333.07100000000003	317.90199999999999	301.536	353.50799999999998	1.1723600000000001	0.25007299999999999	0.26974799999999999	0.1093	1.07868000000000016	462	347.77800000000002	426.21300000000002	384.19099999999997	0.90140799999999999	0.36279299999999998	0.32793600000000001	-0.1457	0.903919999999999957	2619.7800000000002	2091.4400000000001	2543.77	2137.8499999999999	0.84042399999999995	2.15727	1.90717	-0.1778	0.884067000000000058	904.61300000000006	969.29300000000001	859.65499999999997	1016.0599999999999	1.18194	0.70110700000000004	0.86215799999999998	0.2983	1.22971000000000019	2252.3899999999999	2028.8199999999999	2179.4899999999998	2077.1900000000001	0.95306199999999996	1.8815299999999999	1.8941699999999999	0.0097	1.006720000000000110	245.28200000000001	182.12	221.17500000000001	214.524	0.96992800000000001	0.18658	0.18400900000000001	-0.0200	0.9862210000000000111	574.64400000000001	417.53300000000002	535.899	455.37	0.84973100000000001	0.32364100000000001	0.30034300000000003	-0.1078	0.9280129999999999812	409.10899999999998	376.76499999999999	375.04899999999998	413.79199999999997	1.1032999999999999	0.31476900000000002	0.35675800000000002	0.1807	1.133413	4262.3000000000002	3191.8499999999999	4159.8100000000004	3228.1199999999999	0.77602499999999996	3.0171800000000002	2.3453400000000002	-0.3634	0.7773290000000000514	4498.8599999999997	4656.8100000000004	4396.0500000000002	4654.1099999999997	1.0587	3.8384100000000001	3.9169999999999998	0.0292	1.0204715	975.08900000000006	965.06700000000001	928.98199999999997	1011.77	1.0891200000000001	0.81765500000000002	0.76222500000000004	-0.1013	0.9322089999999999516	3074.2199999999998	2637.1500000000001	2991.8400000000001	2676.6500000000001	0.89464900000000003	2.3857300000000001	2.1878899999999999	-0.1249	0.9170749999999999717	4498.8599999999997	4656.8100000000004	4396.0500000000002	4654.1099999999997	1.0587	3.8384100000000001	3.9169999999999998	0.0292	1.0204718	4262.3000000000002	3191.8499999999999	4159.8100000000004	3228.1199999999999	0.77602499999999996	3.0171800000000002	2.3453400000000002	-0.3634	0.7773290000000000519	409.10899999999998	376.76499999999999	375.04899999999998	413.79199999999997	1.1032999999999999	0.31476900000000002	0.35675800000000002	0.1807	1.133420	1942.48	2370.3800000000001	1877.8	2413.52	1.28529	1.65419	1.82108	0.1387	1.1008899999999999!sample_table_end
