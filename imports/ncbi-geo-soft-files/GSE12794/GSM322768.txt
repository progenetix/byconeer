Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322768/suppl/GSM322768.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	503.56900000000002	573.49800000000005	502.41899999999998	572.63499999999999	1.1397600000000001	0.75227100000000002	0.77438899999999999	0.0418	1.02940000000000012	6718.54	6528.0600000000004	7029.7799999999997	6070.8500000000004	0.863591	9.2278199999999995	8.5693800000000007	-0.1068	0.9286473	239.19999999999999	190.733	228.023	206.459	0.90542800000000001	0.249226	0.26774700000000001	0.1034	1.07431999999999994	13618.6	13416.299999999999	14409.6	12416.700000000001	0.86170000000000002	16.7012	16.8779	0.0152	1.010585	187.44399999999999	169.667	175.11199999999999	186.143	1.0629999999999999	0.25168000000000001	0.27350999999999998	0.1200	1.086746	196.364	175.71600000000001	184.16300000000001	191.999	1.0425500000000001	0.26009399999999999	0.27859299999999998	0.0991	1.07112999999999997	568.39999999999998	694.24400000000003	570.07100000000003	687.24300000000005	1.2055400000000001	0.965727	0.995224	0.0434	1.030548	666.64400000000001	798.04399999999998	671.17899999999997	784.84799999999996	1.16936	0.83927399999999996	1.0155799999999999	0.2751	1.210079	1410.3099999999999	1443.46	1439.8599999999999	1393.3599999999999	0.96770199999999995	2.2806799999999998	2.04928	-0.1543	0.8985400000000000110	187.738	164.54400000000001	175.52099999999999	181.54900000000001	1.03434	0.24119599999999999	0.240451	-0.0045	0.9969080000000000211	205.071	209	193.03700000000001	224.02799999999999	1.16055	0.25131900000000001	0.28675200000000001	0.1903	1.140989999999999912	163.77600000000001	128.15299999999999	151.434	146.34	0.96636200000000005	0.23174500000000001	0.207704	-0.1580	0.8962630000000000313	1884.21	1751.99	1938.05	1678.28	0.86596300000000004	2.8144999999999998	2.3582700000000001	-0.2551	0.8379010000000000114	2240.5599999999999	2388.8499999999999	2310.9099999999999	2266.3899999999999	0.98073299999999997	3.5060799999999999	3.5112000000000001	0.0021	1.0014615	846.90700000000004	603.19100000000003	857.47699999999998	600.91300000000001	0.70079199999999997	1.05884	0.89833300000000005	-0.2372	0.8484089999999999716	1161.8599999999999	1257.52	1183.77	1217.8800000000001	1.0288200000000001	1.57643	1.7215400000000001	0.1270	1.0920517	2240.5599999999999	2388.8499999999999	2310.9099999999999	2266.3899999999999	0.98073299999999997	3.5060799999999999	3.5112000000000001	0.0021	1.0014618	1884.21	1751.99	1938.05	1678.28	0.86596300000000004	2.8144999999999998	2.3582700000000001	-0.2551	0.8379010000000000119	163.77600000000001	128.15299999999999	151.434	146.34	0.96636200000000005	0.23174500000000001	0.207704	-0.1580	0.8962630000000000320	900.06700000000001	904.55600000000004	912.62900000000002	885.952	0.97076899999999999	1.1938200000000001	1.3582099999999999	0.1861	1.1376999999999999!sample_table_end
