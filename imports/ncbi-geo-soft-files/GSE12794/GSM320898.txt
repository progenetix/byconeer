Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320898/suppl/GSM320898.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3144	2671	3231.4788000000003	2583.2976000000003	0.79941649999999997	1.6230700999999998	1.3513871	-0.2643	0.832611700000000072	2442	2349	2514.3848000000003	2275.0576000000001	0.90481679999999998	1.134944	1.0602773999999999	-0.0982	0.934211200000000023	1469	1402	1510.0588	1361.2924	0.90148309999999998	0.98481749000000007	0.90091374000000002	-0.1285	0.914802699999999974	2708	3147	2786.3452000000002	3037.4947000000002	1.0901358000000001	1.8993837999999998	2.1342951999999999	0.1682	1.12367775	6316	7760	6472.8053	7509.2085000000006	1.1601165	4.3865948000000001	5.1823261	0.2405	1.18140076	3444	3967	3542.6263000000004	3832.0745000000002	1.0817044	2.2762129999999998	2.5360925000000001	0.1560	1.11417189999999997	856	1118	886.70581000000004	1085.9257	1.2246741999999999	0.77484395000000006	0.96281192000000004	0.3133	1.24258819999999998	794	837	823.25492000000008	811.25324000000012	0.98542169999999996	0.54982271000000005	0.55098491000000005	0.0030	1.00211380000000019	3323	3806	3416.8639000000003	3675.4179000000004	1.0756699999999999	1.3952561999999999	1.5512937999999998	0.1529	1.111834410	4256	5188	4369.7937000000002	5014.0369000000001	1.1474310000000001	2.8873667999999997	3.2400216999999998	0.1662	1.122137200000000111	10182	10127	10361.502	9838.4331000000002	0.94951810000000003	7.2105150999999994	6.8120395	-0.0820	0.9447368999999999912	1551	1523	1595.3415	1476.7568000000001	0.92566809999999999	1.3758127999999998	1.2820566	-0.1018	0.9318540000000000713	1199	1583	1236.5334	1534.0852	1.2406339	1.0487938999999999	1.2519936999999999	0.2555	1.193746199999999914	5236	5518	5370.7262000000001	5335.5671000000002	0.99345360000000005	2.2355529999999999	2.3131075000000001	0.0492	1.034691415	1471	1591	1512.1008000000002	1541.8022000000001	1.0196425	1.1781279999999998	1.1851810999999999	0.0086	1.005986716	877	1165	908.41108000000008	1130.7461000000001	1.2447516000000001	0.74245295	0.94066645999999998	0.3414	1.266971099999999917	1108	1094	1142.8771000000002	1062.9029	0.93002379999999996	0.52630390999999999	0.50764476999999997	-0.0521	0.9645468000000000418	3344	3167	3438.7335000000003	3056.7175000000002	0.88890789999999997	1.6895838999999999	1.5461792999999999	-0.1280	0.915124319	1697	1807	1745.1567	1753.2857000000001	1.0046581000000001	0.81586574000000001	0.84821331	0.0561	1.039648220	960	907	991.97251000000006	879.91575000000012	0.88703639999999995	0.55670078000000001	0.48771140000000002	-0.1909	0.87607460000000004!sample_table_end
