Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322891/suppl/GSM322891.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	646.77800000000002	831.13300000000004	701.86199999999997	768.255	1.09459	0.77480899999999997	0.84467400000000004	0.1246	1.09017000000000012	6112.5799999999999	7913.0799999999999	6249.21	7700.9899999999998	1.23231	6.1098800000000004	7.5807399999999996	0.3112	1.240743	231.173	387.31599999999997	277.12	334.92200000000003	1.20858	0.30312699999999998	0.36305300000000001	0.2603	1.19768999999999994	18067.599999999999	22603.799999999999	18186.799999999999	22392.299999999999	1.2312399999999999	21.578700000000001	25.5441	0.2434	1.18375999999999995	204.11099999999999	313.46699999999998	249.45400000000001	262.80099999999999	1.0535099999999999	0.27800399999999997	0.28258	0.0236	1.01645999999999996	279.911	319.60399999999998	326.91000000000003	268.81299999999999	0.82228400000000001	0.37165399999999998	0.298537	-0.3161	0.803266000000000047	1624.1300000000001	1825.6199999999999	1698.1900000000001	1737.4200000000001	1.0230999999999999	1.7421199999999999	1.8048	0.0510	1.03597999999999998	2437.8000000000002	2842.4200000000001	2527.3699999999999	2728.6700000000001	1.07965	2.4802300000000002	2.6850800000000001	0.1145	1.08258999999999999	3049.3499999999999	3228.6900000000001	3151.04	3102.0599999999999	0.98445700000000003	3.13043	3.0906500000000001	-0.0185	0.9872910000000000310	106.59399999999999	185.25899999999999	150.91800000000001	144.78100000000001	0.95933900000000005	0.13314799999999999	0.12919700000000001	-0.0435	0.9703249999999999911	232.58699999999999	328.036	278.56700000000001	277.10399999999998	0.99475000000000002	0.27203100000000002	0.26787699999999998	-0.0222	0.9847320000000000512	390.154	461.54000000000002	441.30200000000002	406.27600000000001	0.92063099999999998	0.46072099999999999	0.42342800000000003	-0.1218	0.9190540000000000413	3233.4499999999998	3376.6100000000001	3335.4299999999998	3249.2800000000002	0.97416999999999998	3.54983	3.4201100000000002	-0.0537	0.9634589999999999514	5308.0699999999997	5683.7799999999997	5435.54	5509.4099999999999	1.01359	6.1137100000000002	6.1942899999999996	0.0189	1.0131815	567.14200000000005	833.81799999999998	620.221	770.87599999999998	1.24291	0.73409000000000002	0.87268400000000002	0.2495	1.188800000000000116	1402.28	1608.0999999999999	1472.6500000000001	1524.9400000000001	1.0355099999999999	1.5790299999999999	1.6073200000000001	0.0256	1.017919999999999917	5308.0699999999997	5683.7799999999997	5435.54	5509.4099999999999	1.01359	6.1137100000000002	6.1942899999999996	0.0189	1.0131818	3233.4499999999998	3376.6100000000001	3335.4299999999998	3249.2800000000002	0.97416999999999998	3.54983	3.4201100000000002	-0.0537	0.9634589999999999519	390.154	461.54000000000002	441.30200000000002	406.27600000000001	0.92063099999999998	0.46072099999999999	0.42342800000000003	-0.1218	0.9190540000000000420	1105.1700000000001	1479.5	1168.9200000000001	1399.9200000000001	1.1976199999999999	1.3756699999999999	1.59877	0.2168	1.1621699999999999!sample_table_end
