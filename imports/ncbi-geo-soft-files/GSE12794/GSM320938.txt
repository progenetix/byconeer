Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320938/suppl/GSM320938.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1895	1356	1854.1829	1379.6987000000001	0.74410069999999995	0.88330061000000004	0.65357752000000002	-0.4345	0.739926500000000042	2472	2358	2414.7234000000003	2403.4106999999999	0.99531510000000001	1.2501430999999998	1.2348129999999999	-0.0178	0.987737300000000043	1672	1270	1640.0227	1289.9753000000001	0.78655940000000002	0.61436957000000003	0.48824677999999999	-0.3315	0.794711900000000034	7997	8147	7741.5569000000005	8320.1365000000005	1.0747369	3.1580697999999998	3.4369935999999996	0.1221	1.08832099999999995	12744	16454	12259.27	16956.753000000001	1.383178	5.3055177999999996	7.4481253999999995	0.4894	1.40384519999999996	6379	6616	6189.4606000000003	6751.7651000000005	1.0908487	2.6207756	2.9225080999999999	0.1572	1.11513099999999997	1803	1828	1766.3015	1864.7261000000001	1.0557236000000001	0.82666890999999998	0.92216189000000004	0.1577	1.11551548	1904	1817	1862.8358000000001	1853.1346000000001	0.99479220000000002	0.80145564000000002	0.80645673000000007	0.0090	1.006249	2115	2242	2064.9536000000003	2284.1754000000001	1.106163	1.0034893999999999	1.1026658999999999	0.1360	1.098831610	9472	9601	9154.6820000000007	9817.0920000000006	1.0723575000000001	3.4493459	3.7399179999999999	0.1167	1.084239811	12182	8969	11728.384	9163.2245000000003	0.78128620000000004	4.5721102	3.6279633999999996	-0.3337	0.793498712	6584	5610	6385.1983	5722.7487000000001	0.8962523	2.6873288999999998	2.5497017	-0.0758	0.9487866000000000413	2140	2217	2088.7637	2258.4318000000003	1.0812288999999999	0.84685465000000004	0.93807331999999999	0.1476	1.107714700000000114	6465	6641	6271.5882000000001	6777.4151000000002	1.0806537000000001	4.3029776999999996	4.6122871999999999	0.1001	1.071882715	2073	1702	2024.9346	1732.8453000000002	0.85575369999999995	0.84771634000000007	0.74507257000000005	-0.1862	0.8789173000000000116	2219	2417	2165.1015000000002	2464.0221000000001	1.1380631000000001	0.90883206000000005	1.0935629999999998	0.2670	1.203262000000000117	940	801	944.04200000000003	806.28880000000004	0.85408150000000005	0.48606691000000002	0.41615181000000001	-0.2240	0.8561615999999999718	3663	3214	3563.1458000000002	3279.154	0.92029740000000004	1.6543223	1.5251253	-0.1173	0.9219034000000000419	1742	1504	1707.6305	1531.9091000000001	0.89709629999999996	0.89446031999999998	0.79054426	-0.1782	0.8838226000000000120	2252	1760	2197.0660000000003	1793.299	0.81622450000000002	0.82004579	0.66062067000000002	-0.3119	0.80559000000000003!sample_table_end
