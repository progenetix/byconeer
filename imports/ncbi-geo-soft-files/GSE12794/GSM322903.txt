Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322903/suppl/GSM322903.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1388.27	1227.9100000000001	1467.3800000000001	1149.3	0.78323500000000001	0.92592699999999994	0.74413600000000002	-0.3153	0.803667000000000022	3803.7600000000002	4824.2799999999997	3898.4699999999998	4649.8400000000001	1.1927300000000001	3.3784000000000001	3.7495500000000002	0.1504	1.10986000000000013	491.58699999999999	536.83100000000002	557.23299999999995	471.04300000000001	0.84532399999999996	0.36605399999999999	0.306251	-0.2573	0.836628000000000044	4972.4399999999996	6145.2200000000003	5066.3299999999999	5923.54	1.1692	3.2989799999999998	3.7883100000000001	0.1995	1.14833000000000015	413.44900000000001	512.68399999999997	477.64100000000002	447.48000000000002	0.93685200000000002	0.34150999999999998	0.31245099999999998	-0.1283	0.914911999999999956	328.22199999999998	574.06700000000001	390.80399999999997	507.57799999999997	1.29881	0.29359499999999999	0.377917	0.3642	1.287217	3541.9200000000001	3291.5999999999999	3635.46	3161.6599999999999	0.86967399999999995	2.0755300000000001	1.9165000000000001	-0.1150	0.923379999999999988	2447.8800000000001	2814.9299999999998	2537.1700000000001	2699.2399999999998	1.0638799999999999	2.1723599999999998	2.25413	0.0533	1.03763999999999999	5959.54	6733.0100000000002	6055.7299999999996	6479.71	1.0700099999999999	3.9622000000000002	4.2658899999999997	0.1065	1.076650000000000110	181.93299999999999	335.95800000000003	244.29400000000001	280.67700000000002	1.14893	0.16781499999999999	0.19220000000000001	0.1957	1.145310000000000111	644.69799999999998	815.77300000000002	712.298	744.35799999999995	1.04501	0.436585	0.45477499999999998	0.0589	1.0416612	838.90700000000004	931.91200000000003	911.29200000000003	857.69399999999996	0.94118400000000002	0.53711799999999998	0.53030600000000006	-0.0184	0.98731713	7384.7399999999998	6522.6300000000001	7483.6000000000004	6286.4399999999996	0.840028	4.8902200000000002	4.2096900000000002	-0.2162	0.8608400000000000514	9329.0799999999999	9989.5900000000001	9516.9699999999993	9507.6200000000008	0.99901700000000004	6.5436300000000003	6.6833799999999997	0.0305	1.0213615	2833	2999.4000000000001	2925.3800000000001	2878.1900000000001	0.98386899999999999	2.0744400000000001	1.9539299999999999	-0.0863	0.9419070000000000516	3068.48	3182.8600000000001	3162.0900000000001	3053.8800000000001	0.96577900000000005	2.6192799999999998	2.4298799999999998	-0.1083	0.9276879999999999617	9329.0799999999999	9989.5900000000001	9516.9699999999993	9507.6200000000008	0.99901700000000004	6.5436300000000003	6.6833799999999997	0.0305	1.0213618	7384.7399999999998	6522.6300000000001	7483.6000000000004	6286.4399999999996	0.840028	4.8902200000000002	4.2096900000000002	-0.2162	0.8608400000000000519	838.90700000000004	931.91200000000003	911.29200000000003	857.69399999999996	0.94118400000000002	0.53711799999999998	0.53030600000000006	-0.0184	0.98731720	1977.24	2497.0300000000002	2061.77	2389.3000000000002	1.15886	1.5428500000000001	1.77694	0.2038	1.1517299999999999!sample_table_end
