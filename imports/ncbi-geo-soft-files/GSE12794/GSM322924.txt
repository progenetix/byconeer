Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322924/suppl/GSM322924.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	480.06700000000001	443.97300000000001	456.46899999999999	469.70100000000002	1.0289900000000001	0.38193300000000002	0.397615	0.0581	1.04106000000000012	13382.9	13907	12969.700000000001	14189.799999999999	1.0940799999999999	10.3881	10.7791	0.0533	1.03763999999999993	441.911	332.13299999999998	420.31099999999998	352.55599999999998	0.83879800000000004	0.27829599999999999	0.24576799999999999	-0.1793	0.883116000000000014	15498	14898.700000000001	14983.6	15217.1	1.0155799999999999	11.6183	11.5801	-0.0048	0.996709999999999985	282.71100000000001	312.71100000000001	270.20600000000002	332.02800000000002	1.22879	0.19511100000000001	0.241309	0.3066	1.236786	494.70699999999999	530.19600000000003	470.37400000000002	559.65800000000002	1.18981	0.33378200000000002	0.409022	0.2933	1.225427	1712.9300000000001	1317.8	1649.03	1368.8199999999999	0.830071	1.5140499999999999	1.2294799999999999	-0.3004	0.812042999999999968	758.20000000000005	752.822	722.93600000000004	790.67899999999997	1.0936999999999999	0.56895700000000005	0.61205200000000004	0.1053	1.07573999999999999	1823.96	1681.8	1757.9100000000001	1738.3800000000001	0.98889000000000005	1.4255899999999999	1.4152899999999999	-0.0105	0.9927740000000000510	283.22000000000003	264.63999999999999	271.28899999999999	281.08100000000002	1.0361	0.21229000000000001	0.20993999999999999	-0.0161	0.9889329999999999511	198.13300000000001	170.822	192.459	182.11799999999999	0.94626900000000003	0.134214	0.13147500000000001	-0.0297	0.9795909999999999912	374.77999999999997	343.13299999999998	356.72199999999998	364.00400000000002	1.02041	0.30307499999999998	0.30963600000000002	0.0309	1.021649999999999913	3930.5599999999999	3119.1500000000001	3815.5900000000001	3198.2600000000002	0.83821000000000001	2.9425699999999999	2.5092500000000002	-0.2298	0.8527390000000000214	3498.0599999999999	3225.27	3395.7399999999998	3294.8499999999999	0.97028800000000004	2.9355099999999998	2.8913799999999998	-0.0219	0.9849660000000000115	461.55599999999998	398.88900000000001	438.92000000000002	422.57999999999998	0.96277299999999999	0.37812600000000002	0.378525	0.0015	1.001060000000000116	1764.26	1585.3099999999999	1699.6199999999999	1640.8	0.96538900000000005	1.35734	1.2987	-0.0637	0.9567989999999999617	3498.0599999999999	3225.27	3395.7399999999998	3294.8499999999999	0.97028800000000004	2.9355099999999998	2.8913799999999998	-0.0219	0.9849660000000000118	3930.5599999999999	3119.1500000000001	3815.5900000000001	3198.2600000000002	0.83821000000000001	2.9425699999999999	2.5092500000000002	-0.2298	0.8527390000000000219	374.77999999999997	343.13299999999998	356.72199999999998	364.00400000000002	1.02041	0.30307499999999998	0.30963600000000002	0.0309	1.021649999999999920	1824.6400000000001	1664.45	1758.05	1721.0699999999999	0.97896300000000003	1.70356	1.73488	0.0263	1.0183800000000001!sample_table_end
