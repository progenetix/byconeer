Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320896/suppl/GSM320896.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1241	1086	1255.6156000000001	1075.8891000000001	0.85686189999999995	0.84504098999999999	0.71283013000000006	-0.2455	0.843544999999999992	2122	2143	2153.9083000000001	2103.6610000000001	0.97667150000000003	1.6256991999999999	1.5488611999999999	-0.0699	0.952735400000000013	1440	1543	1460.3074000000001	1520.0529000000001	1.040913	0.83636500999999996	0.87313233000000001	0.0621	1.04396084	5307	6455	5349.4612000000006	6369.1972000000005	1.1906239999999999	3.1021361000000001	3.7410831999999998	0.2702	1.205975	8389	10334	8350.8846000000012	10339.923000000001	1.238183	4.9063751999999994	6.2464636999999996	0.3484	1.27313216	3235	3487	3288.9412000000002	3416.1341000000002	1.0386728999999999	2.0010042000000001	2.1269383999999998	0.0881	1.06293557	1349	1599	1366.2757000000001	1574.5253	1.1524213999999999	0.76828382000000006	0.90736893000000007	0.2400	1.18103349999999988	1090	1158	1103.579	1145.4271000000001	1.0379202999999999	0.58629922000000001	0.61166646000000002	0.0611	1.04326679	1661	1942	1686.4288000000001	1906.248	1.1303460000000001	1.1505946	1.2736539	0.1466	1.106952810	7017	7532	7031.4659000000001	7453.9625000000005	1.0600866	3.5226740999999997	3.7412654999999999	0.0869	1.062052711	11848	10675	11632.819	10695.02	0.91938339999999996	5.9532299999999996	5.5522757999999994	-0.1006	0.9326493000000000112	3767	3471	3817.6261000000004	3400.2434000000003	0.89066959999999995	2.0653451999999999	1.8788904	-0.1365	0.9097222000000000413	1983	2353	2012.8616000000002	2309.7487000000001	1.1474949999999999	0.99529852000000008	1.0893104999999998	0.1302	1.094456099999999914	4188	3937	4236.1410000000005	3858.9709000000003	0.91096370000000004	3.1895053999999998	2.8849076	-0.1448	0.9044999999999999715	1856	1935	1885.0676000000001	1899.4764	1.0076437	0.90567249999999999	0.90662480000000001	0.0015	1.001051516	1442	1858	1462.3637000000001	1824.9674	1.2479572999999999	0.77175495999999999	0.97762223999999998	0.3411	1.266752099999999917	515	446	523.07413000000008	450.81209000000001	0.86185129999999999	0.38815945000000002	0.32897280000000001	-0.2387	0.8475196999999999918	2621	2527	2662.5324000000001	2477.5450000000001	0.93052199999999996	1.5707225	1.5065309999999998	-0.0602	0.9591325000000000519	997	1006	1008.2446000000001	997.88328000000013	0.98972340000000003	0.73049211000000003	0.70122128000000006	-0.0590	0.9599300000000000620	1222	1170	1236.3707000000002	1156.9705000000001	0.93577960000000004	0.64110507999999999	0.58899170000000001	-0.1223	0.91871320000000001!sample_table_end
