Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320928/suppl/GSM320928.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2263	2209	2319.7420999999999	2151.8571999999999	0.9276278	0.71994299000000006	0.65677487000000001	-0.1325	0.91225952	2894	3388	2963.2867000000001	3294.5416	1.1117862999999999	1.0925885	1.1456534999999999	0.0684	1.04856813	2003	1828	2053.9520000000002	1784.6363000000001	0.86887930000000002	0.61559481999999999	0.54071912	-0.1871	0.87836854	14510	13263	14559.632	12962.157999999999	0.89028059999999998	4.6883758000000002	4.2714444	-0.1344	0.911071199999999975	13267	16358	13331.65	16022.287	1.2018233	4.5309255999999998	5.4680333000000001	0.2712	1.20682479999999996	10309	9678	10403.712	9433.4451000000008	0.90673840000000006	3.464836	3.1728136	-0.1270	0.915718299999999997	1951	2135	2001.0094000000001	2080.6779000000001	1.0398141999999999	0.87165926999999999	0.99307573000000005	0.1881	1.13929358	2393	2374	2451.7126000000003	2309.9007000000001	0.9421581	0.80909065999999996	0.77037266000000004	-0.0707	0.95214639	3189	4132	3262.8485000000001	4017.4965000000002	1.231285	1.1752758999999999	1.341569	0.1909	1.141492810	9180	10647	9281.9866000000002	10386.889000000001	1.1190373	3.5830671999999999	4.0009307999999999	0.1591	1.116621799999999911	7509	7146	7625.1921000000002	6957.6903000000002	0.91246099999999997	2.8373602	2.6171506999999998	-0.1166	0.9223892999999999712	5938	5282	6050.5753000000004	5131.2969000000003	0.84806760000000003	2.9183979	2.6470796999999999	-0.1408	0.9070318000000000513	1323	1469	1360.5851	1439.1750000000002	1.0577618	0.73691766999999997	0.79567931999999997	0.1107	1.079739814	8460	9467	8564.5472000000009	9224.635400000001	1.0770721999999999	3.2254844999999999	3.2018320999999998	-0.0106	0.9926669999999999715	2015	1850	2066.2705000000001	1805.6094000000001	0.87384949999999995	0.83642729999999998	0.75763601000000003	-0.1427	0.9058002000000000616	1664	2018	1707.9090000000001	1967.2738000000002	1.151861	0.79126841000000003	0.97227609000000004	0.2972	1.228756417	1029	1057	1064.1611	1035.2582	0.97283969999999997	0.37069272000000003	0.34565316000000001	-0.1009	0.9324520000000000618	3944	3907	4038.7747000000004	3799.5743000000002	0.940774	1.4010727999999999	1.2836797	-0.1262	0.9162120000000000319	1728	1777	1773.5275000000001	1735.9963	0.97883810000000004	0.67708736000000003	0.61694946000000006	-0.1342	0.9111814999999999820	2448	2266	2507.3233	2206.6170999999999	0.88006879999999998	0.99381054000000002	0.83751339000000002	-0.2469	0.84272940000000007!sample_table_end
