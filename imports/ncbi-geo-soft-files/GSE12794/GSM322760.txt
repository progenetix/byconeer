Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322760/suppl/GSM322760.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	423.42200000000003	746.178	505.928	611.05999999999995	1.2078	1.1370499999999999	1.37825	0.2776	1.212142	3087.7600000000002	5866.1999999999998	3812.7800000000002	4634.3800000000001	1.21549	8.4772700000000007	9.6141900000000007	0.1816	1.134113	128.59100000000001	102.15600000000001	131.97	109.18600000000001	0.82735800000000004	0.265432	0.23616599999999999	-0.1685	0.8897414	6558.6000000000004	7642.1099999999997	7790.04	6131.7700000000004	0.78713	16.540800000000001	14.032299999999999	-0.2373	0.848338999999999955	171.542	190.089	185.22300000000001	180.221	0.97299100000000005	0.34073900000000001	0.34700599999999998	0.0263	1.01838999999999996	220.97800000000001	252.244	247.93299999999999	229.465	0.92550900000000003	0.58535599999999999	0.56441200000000002	-0.0526	0.964220999999999997	678.476	1119.8900000000001	830.98199999999997	892.95000000000005	1.07457	1.7013199999999999	1.77711	0.0629	1.04455000000000018	361.30700000000002	424.07999999999998	427.08999999999997	363.61000000000001	0.85136500000000004	0.76557699999999995	0.67404299999999995	-0.1837	0.880438000000000059	1060.1300000000001	1567.0599999999999	1309.6400000000001	1237.9200000000001	0.94523900000000005	2.8174999999999999	2.63252	-0.0980	0.9343430000000000310	113.432	106.02800000000001	115.943	112.374	0.96921999999999997	0.25801499999999999	0.222635	-0.2128	0.8628770000000000111	196.02199999999999	257.62200000000001	216.048	233.71100000000001	1.0817600000000001	0.43015199999999998	0.48697800000000002	0.1790	1.132109999999999912	188.703	217.19300000000001	206.773	202.048	0.97714800000000002	0.42580000000000001	0.41548200000000002	-0.0354	0.9757660000000000213	742.73099999999999	1043.25	911.34799999999996	837.50400000000002	0.91897300000000004	1.9036900000000001	1.7774799999999999	-0.0990	0.9337020000000000314	1113.96	2015.71	1384.1500000000001	1573.96	1.13713	2.9045200000000002	3.3809800000000001	0.2191	1.1640415	327.72899999999998	359.78699999999998	384.41500000000002	313.98599999999999	0.81678899999999999	0.81953900000000002	0.74860099999999996	-0.1306	0.9134419999999999816	856.98800000000006	1050.8699999999999	1058.8199999999999	842.66399999999999	0.79585399999999995	2.0712600000000001	1.69919	-0.2857	0.8203669999999999617	1113.96	2015.71	1384.1500000000001	1573.96	1.13713	2.9045200000000002	3.3809800000000001	0.2191	1.1640418	742.73099999999999	1043.25	911.34799999999996	837.50400000000002	0.91897300000000004	1.9036900000000001	1.7774799999999999	-0.0990	0.9337020000000000319	188.703	217.19300000000001	206.773	202.048	0.97714800000000002	0.42580000000000001	0.41548200000000002	-0.0354	0.9757660000000000220	511.84399999999999	977.22199999999998	618.88099999999997	785.97199999999998	1.26999	1.4180600000000001	1.9038600000000001	0.4250	1.3425800000000001!sample_table_end
