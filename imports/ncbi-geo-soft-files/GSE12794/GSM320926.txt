Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320926/suppl/GSM320926.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1433	1522	1473.0413000000001	1483.0691000000002	1.0068075000000001	0.80202669000000004	0.75173972	-0.0934	0.937300099999999972	1761	2488	1807.5433	2395.8656000000001	1.3254817000000001	0.96593224	1.0711481999999999	0.1492	1.10892689999999993	924	984	946.90116000000012	976.86074000000008	1.0316396000000001	0.49862428000000003	0.52988042000000002	0.0877	1.06268469999999994	8114	7224	8262.0282999999999	6834.0439000000006	0.82716299999999998	5.2016704999999996	4.4487842999999998	-0.2256	0.855260699999999985	8744	10456	8905.2358999999997	9855.1859999999997	1.1066731999999999	4.5863499999999995	5.3819384999999995	0.2308	1.17346886	5672	5614	5796.3559000000005	5342.8536000000004	0.92176080000000005	3.2781721999999998	3.079914	-0.0900	0.939521700000000027	1634	1633	1680.3563000000001	1588.4984000000002	0.94533420000000001	0.80815356000000005	0.96360348000000007	0.2538	1.19235199999999998	1249	1328	1279.5363	1298.5307	1.0148448000000001	0.72213592999999998	0.74203567000000004	0.0392	1.02755679999999999	3662	4940	3755.7771000000002	4712.4669000000004	1.2547249	1.7936831	1.8439519999999998	0.0399	1.028025510	8044	8848	8190.5199000000002	8347.9464000000007	1.0192205999999999	4.3666532999999994	4.4864258999999995	0.0390	1.027428899999999911	6591	7183	6717.9808000000003	6796.1202000000003	1.0116314	3.7301061999999998	3.8324889	0.0391	1.027447599999999912	4991	3673	5118.6332000000002	3509.6076000000003	0.68565330000000002	2.6228211999999997	2.1991809999999998	-0.2542	0.8384791999999999813	2139	2183	2194.8816999999999	2106.788	0.95986400000000005	1.1152906	1.2425811	0.1559	1.114132114	4888	6014	5014.9598999999998	5714.9278000000004	1.1395759999999999	3.0469481999999997	2.8129475999999998	-0.1153	0.9232016000000000715	3198	2781	3280.3175000000001	2671.0370000000003	0.81426169999999998	1.6604250999999999	1.5439437999999999	-0.1049	0.9298484999999999716	2329	2411	2393.2348999999999	2322.5302000000001	0.9704564	1.1759975	1.426361	0.2785	1.212894617	542	781	555.8444300000001	785.16549000000009	1.4125634	0.30075683000000003	0.36290202999999999	0.2710	1.206629418	2832	3153	2908.8927000000003	3019.6164000000003	1.0380639	1.4418738	1.4415115999999999	-0.0004	0.9997487999999999919	1421	1852	1460.6911	1792.5732	1.2272088999999999	0.75765444000000004	0.75639878999999999	-0.0024	0.9983427000000000320	1371	1426	1409.23	1391.5765000000001	0.98747300000000005	0.65477901000000005	0.58435561000000003	-0.1642	0.89244710000000005!sample_table_end
