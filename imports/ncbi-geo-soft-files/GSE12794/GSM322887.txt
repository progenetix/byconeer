Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322887/suppl/GSM322887.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	393.77300000000002	441.98200000000003	453.35700000000003	363.47899999999998	0.80174999999999996	0.59443800000000002	0.45894099999999999	-0.3732	0.772058000000000022	2664.9099999999999	3488.96	2612.7600000000002	3540.1100000000001	1.35493	3.5503	4.8958700000000004	0.4636	1.3793	270.22199999999998	372.56	334.42099999999999	287.79199999999997	0.86056600000000005	0.40174199999999999	0.32512200000000002	-0.3053	0.809284	9781.2299999999996	10320	9412.6700000000001	10566.4	1.1225700000000001	11.4024	11.927300000000001	0.0649	1.04604000000000015	173.46700000000001	288.50700000000001	240.13800000000001	208.227	0.86711400000000005	0.27796599999999999	0.235792	-0.2374	0.8482756	128.59999999999999	351.06700000000001	196.084	265.45100000000002	1.3537600000000001	0.26098399999999999	0.337785	0.3721	1.294277	767.596	944	808.053	899.88499999999999	1.11365	1.0219800000000001	1.1370100000000001	0.1539	1.112568	2219.1599999999999	1940.51	2188.52	1941.8099999999999	0.88727199999999995	2.7992400000000002	2.5426099999999998	-0.1387	0.908321000000000059	2080.2199999999998	2102.5	2082.3699999999999	2074.1700000000001	0.99605999999999995	2.5861700000000001	2.6141000000000001	0.0155	1.010799999999999910	107.54300000000001	224.21700000000001	175.23400000000001	164.24700000000001	0.93729899999999999	0.212228	0.21149100000000001	-0.0050	0.9965249999999999911	128.19999999999999	333.78199999999998	195.69499999999999	247.84800000000001	1.2665	0.21879000000000001	0.26383000000000001	0.2701	1.205859999999999912	276.34699999999998	401.846	341.483	318.78800000000001	0.93353900000000001	0.41156599999999999	0.386882	-0.0892	0.94002513	3829.4000000000001	3710.1399999999999	3730.79	3765.4000000000001	1.00928	4.6632199999999999	4.4740399999999996	-0.0598	0.9594300000000000114	9320.4099999999999	7742.1499999999996	8975.8099999999995	7900.1000000000004	0.88015500000000002	11.3492	9.9002400000000002	-0.1970	0.8723330000000000315	819.31100000000004	1033.76	857.07500000000005	994.89999999999998	1.1608099999999999	1.0038	1.1115699999999999	0.1471	1.107359999999999916	1519.97	1429.3099999999999	1526.74	1404.8099999999999	0.92013999999999996	2.1245400000000001	1.90724	-0.1557	0.8977180000000000217	9320.4099999999999	7742.1499999999996	8975.8099999999995	7900.1000000000004	0.88015500000000002	11.3492	9.9002400000000002	-0.1970	0.8723330000000000318	3829.4000000000001	3710.1399999999999	3730.79	3765.4000000000001	1.00928	4.6632199999999999	4.4740399999999996	-0.0598	0.9594300000000000119	276.34699999999998	401.846	341.483	318.78800000000001	0.93353900000000001	0.41156599999999999	0.386882	-0.0892	0.94002520	1582.4000000000001	1503.5999999999999	1581.1800000000001	1486.99	0.94042800000000004	1.97872	1.7628299999999999	-0.1667	0.89089499999999999!sample_table_end
