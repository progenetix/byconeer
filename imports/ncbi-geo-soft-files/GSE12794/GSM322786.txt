Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322786/suppl/GSM322786.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1423.04	1595.6199999999999	1455.1300000000001	1551.51	1.06623	1.48766	1.5852900000000001	0.0917	1.06563000000000012	8010.6700000000001	9581.4300000000003	8345.6100000000006	9102.3500000000004	1.0906800000000001	6.9370099999999999	7.6065300000000002	0.1329	1.09651000000000013	249.751	217.578	252.27500000000001	219.71799999999999	0.87094800000000006	0.20466300000000001	0.182425	-0.1659	0.891344000000000034	15949.1	18047.299999999999	16395.700000000001	17445.700000000001	1.0640400000000001	13.849399999999999	14.869199999999999	0.1025	1.07363000000000015	322.298	313.14699999999999	326.38900000000001	312.98200000000003	0.95892299999999997	0.30391400000000002	0.28947200000000001	-0.0702	0.952481000000000026	290.31099999999998	352.23099999999999	293.66399999999999	351.09800000000001	1.1955800000000001	0.30598199999999998	0.36009400000000003	0.2349	1.17684000000000017	1246.04	1597.28	1273.26	1553.0799999999999	1.21977	1.41994	1.77234	0.3198	1.24818000000000018	830.99099999999999	1009.5599999999999	847.36000000000001	989.05399999999997	1.1672199999999999	0.76529199999999997	0.87927999999999995	0.2003	1.14894999999999999	2194.52	2124.4099999999999	2253.6500000000001	2053.1500000000001	0.91103400000000001	2.2906399999999998	2.0718100000000002	-0.1449	0.9044659999999999910	190.46600000000001	189.482	191.72499999999999	192.46100000000001	1.0038400000000001	0.16989899999999999	0.17372499999999999	0.0321	1.022520000000000111	464.24400000000003	523.58699999999999	471.86099999999999	517.62699999999995	1.0969899999999999	0.430008	0.47633300000000001	0.1476	1.107730000000000112	304.267	284.94900000000001	307.95800000000003	285.51999999999998	0.92713900000000005	0.32971499999999998	0.313863	-0.0711	0.9519220000000000513	3460.5	3388.0799999999999	3578.8600000000001	3242.9200000000001	0.90613200000000005	3.54697	3.28498	-0.1107	0.9261350000000000414	3928.4899999999998	3890.8800000000001	4065.6799999999998	3720.1199999999999	0.91500599999999999	4.0656299999999996	3.81087	-0.0934	0.9373390000000000315	1979.6199999999999	1805.26	2028.21	1751.3699999999999	0.863506	1.66015	1.51654	-0.1305	0.91349716	1728.3299999999999	1975.28	1769.3	1912.99	1.08121	1.70662	1.83565	0.1052	1.0756117	3928.4899999999998	3890.8800000000001	4065.6799999999998	3720.1199999999999	0.91500599999999999	4.0656299999999996	3.81087	-0.0934	0.9373390000000000318	3460.5	3388.0799999999999	3578.8600000000001	3242.9200000000001	0.90613200000000005	3.54697	3.28498	-0.1107	0.9261350000000000419	304.267	284.94900000000001	307.95800000000003	285.51999999999998	0.92713900000000005	0.32971499999999998	0.313863	-0.0711	0.9519220000000000520	1993	2192.2199999999998	2042.0999999999999	2118.21	1.0372699999999999	1.5456799999999999	1.77911	0.2029	1.1510199999999999!sample_table_end
