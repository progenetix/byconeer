Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322788/suppl/GSM322788.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	532.55100000000004	543.37800000000004	517.70600000000002	562.44299999999998	1.0864100000000001	0.57180299999999995	0.61409899999999995	0.1030	1.07397000000000012	6940.0500000000002	7727.3400000000001	6692.6899999999996	7810.4099999999999	1.1670100000000001	7.7848499999999996	8.7305600000000005	0.1654	1.121483	330.036	313.89800000000002	326.45800000000003	321.19799999999998	0.98388799999999998	0.32382100000000003	0.34855599999999998	0.1062	1.076394	9984.5300000000007	9678.7299999999996	9684.6900000000005	9762.6700000000001	1.0080499999999999	11.173999999999999	11.755100000000001	0.0731	1.05200999999999995	242.97300000000001	314.77300000000002	245.55199999999999	322.12099999999998	1.31182	0.27506999999999998	0.36973800000000001	0.4267	1.344166	304.36399999999998	308.35599999999999	302.43700000000001	315.351	1.0427	0.36016500000000001	0.384243	0.0934	1.06685000000000017	848.77800000000002	953.98699999999997	816.38599999999997	990.60400000000004	1.2134	0.98999800000000004	1.1637599999999999	0.2333	1.17551000000000018	698.471	708.42200000000003	674.05100000000004	734.63699999999994	1.08988	0.751251	0.81115899999999996	0.1107	1.07973999999999999	2293.23	2045.2	2199.3299999999999	2102.8800000000001	0.95614500000000002	2.5699200000000002	2.3842099999999999	-0.1082	0.9277339999999999510	294.85500000000002	240.625	294.20299999999997	244.01499999999999	0.82941100000000001	0.31336999999999998	0.25784200000000002	-0.2814	0.8228050000000000111	132.578	143.071	145.828	144.78700000000001	0.99286099999999999	0.15547	0.15496199999999999	-0.0047	0.9967380000000000112	255.80099999999999	246.08699999999999	257.64600000000002	249.68700000000001	0.96911199999999997	0.27691300000000002	0.26854800000000001	-0.0443	0.9697909999999999613	2438.5999999999999	1863.1800000000001	2339.0900000000001	1917.23	0.81964800000000004	2.7651599999999998	2.2409500000000002	-0.3032	0.8104249999999999514	2831.6500000000001	2480.52	2708.8600000000001	2547.1999999999998	0.94031900000000002	3.0966100000000001	2.9934099999999999	-0.0489	0.96667315	493.39999999999998	339.46699999999998	480.92000000000002	348.19400000000002	0.72401700000000002	0.83334200000000003	0.663632	-0.3285	0.7963516	787.93799999999999	683.24599999999998	759.66499999999996	708.346	0.93244499999999997	0.99116800000000005	0.91209499999999999	-0.1199	0.9202219999999999817	2831.6500000000001	2480.52	2708.8600000000001	2547.1999999999998	0.94031900000000002	3.0966100000000001	2.9934099999999999	-0.0489	0.96667318	2438.5999999999999	1863.1800000000001	2339.0900000000001	1917.23	0.81964800000000004	2.7651599999999998	2.2409500000000002	-0.3032	0.8104249999999999519	255.80099999999999	246.08699999999999	257.64600000000002	249.68700000000001	0.96911199999999997	0.27691300000000002	0.26854800000000001	-0.0443	0.9697909999999999620	898.827	864.38699999999994	864.38999999999999	897.23699999999997	1.038	1.13632	1.1972799999999999	0.0754	1.0536399999999999!sample_table_end
