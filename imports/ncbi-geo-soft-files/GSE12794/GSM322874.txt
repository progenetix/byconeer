Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322874/suppl/GSM322874.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	443.86700000000002	383.66699999999997	393.46300000000002	432.12099999999998	1.0982499999999999	0.55588899999999997	0.62243800000000005	0.1631	1.119722	6074.3400000000001	6433.3999999999996	5824.75	6489.9700000000003	1.1142000000000001	8.5607000000000006	9.3874200000000005	0.1330	1.096573	175.102	134.40000000000001	149.46299999999999	164.41300000000001	1.1000300000000001	0.22931699999999999	0.26869300000000002	0.2286	1.171714	3423.8400000000001	2970.9099999999999	3266.0599999999999	3044.9299999999998	0.93229399999999996	5.8933499999999999	5.8912500000000003	-0.0005	0.999643999999999985	208	129.15600000000001	176.43899999999999	158.70599999999999	0.89949400000000002	0.267901	0.24048900000000001	-0.1557	0.897676999999999956	237.911	194.78700000000001	202.518	230.50999999999999	1.13822	0.29829600000000001	0.34092600000000001	0.1927	1.14291000000000017	812.81799999999998	891.09799999999996	744.11099999999999	956.77099999999996	1.28579	1.1059099999999999	1.44339	0.3842	1.305158	682.26700000000005	613.35599999999999	619.66800000000001	672.08699999999999	1.0845899999999999	0.79737499999999994	0.836198	0.0686	1.04868999999999999	2304.48	1751.8499999999999	2176.8200000000002	1828.53	0.84000200000000003	3.1014499999999998	2.5523899999999999	-0.2811	0.8229680000000000310	204.30000000000001	123.089	173.29499999999999	152.30099999999999	0.878853	0.23721300000000001	0.20067499999999999	-0.2413	0.8459680000000000511	121.889	104.02200000000001	109.236	131.994	1.2083299999999999	0.149784	0.177455	0.2446	1.184739999999999912	217.79499999999999	179.78800000000001	184.87200000000001	214.054	1.15785	0.28957699999999997	0.33058399999999999	0.1911	1.1416113	2058.9400000000001	1528.29	1934.3599999999999	1612.5599999999999	0.83364300000000002	2.8789899999999999	2.3920400000000002	-0.2673	0.8308619999999999914	1677.3399999999999	1482.3	1570.8399999999999	1557.48	0.99149399999999999	2.3851200000000001	2.3858100000000002	0.0004	1.000289999999999915	179	153.71100000000001	152.58099999999999	185.47800000000001	1.2156	0.39949200000000001	0.51959699999999998	0.3792	1.300650000000000116	807.90999999999997	710.577	738.63699999999994	771.89599999999996	1.0450299999999999	1.0467500000000001	1.0575600000000001	0.0148	1.0103317	1677.3399999999999	1482.3	1570.8399999999999	1557.48	0.99149399999999999	2.3851200000000001	2.3858100000000002	0.0004	1.000289999999999918	2058.9400000000001	1528.29	1934.3599999999999	1612.5599999999999	0.83364300000000002	2.8789899999999999	2.3920400000000002	-0.2673	0.8308619999999999919	217.79499999999999	179.78800000000001	184.87200000000001	214.054	1.15785	0.28957699999999997	0.33058399999999999	0.1911	1.1416120	794.41300000000001	662.12	726.48800000000006	722.07399999999996	0.99392400000000003	1.40604	1.5480700000000001	0.1388	1.10101!sample_table_end
