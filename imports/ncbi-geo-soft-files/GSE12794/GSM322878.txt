Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322878/suppl/GSM322878.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1778.0699999999999	2180.98	1781.5699999999999	2095.46	1.1761900000000001	3.1215899999999999	3.48298	0.1580	1.11576999999999992	13157.6	12004.9	13037.799999999999	11762.4	0.902173	13.1187	13.059900000000001	-0.0065	0.995524999999999993	104.911	85.218000000000004	101.17100000000001	94.614500000000007	0.93519300000000005	0.121265	0.13276299999999999	0.1307	1.09481999999999994	19688.400000000001	19535.299999999999	19280	19475	1.0101100000000001	20.816400000000002	24.243400000000001	0.2199	1.16463000000000015	658.48000000000002	566.62199999999996	674.37300000000005	554.36400000000003	0.82204299999999997	0.72530600000000001	0.71397200000000005	-0.0227	0.984373000000000056	226.90700000000001	169.524	231.07300000000001	174.52099999999999	0.75526300000000002	0.32501600000000003	0.26999899999999999	-0.2676	0.830725000000000057	1636.78	2440.0700000000002	1643.02	2341.8099999999999	1.4253100000000001	3.91106	4.8269700000000002	0.3036	1.23418999999999998	1347.8900000000001	1515.22	1359.29	1461.45	1.0751599999999999	1.45207	1.6712100000000001	0.2028	1.15091999999999999	4470.1199999999999	4771.04	4450.5299999999997	4592.8199999999997	1.0319700000000001	7.1364999999999998	6.83934	-0.0614	0.9583599999999999910	89.451800000000006	81.351699999999994	85.119200000000006	90.932199999999995	1.06829	0.13136800000000001	0.135459	0.0442	1.031139999999999911	509.04399999999998	356.50200000000001	523.05999999999995	353.20699999999999	0.67527099999999995	0.721105	0.50289099999999998	-0.5200	0.6973890000000000412	397.125	418.14299999999997	408.02800000000002	412.327	1.0105299999999999	0.89866999999999997	0.829928	-0.1148	0.9235069999999999713	2243.5999999999999	1940.0799999999999	2239.9699999999998	1866.1500000000001	0.833117	3.6633200000000001	3.12235	-0.2305	0.8523269999999999514	1289.54	1298.7	1303.6500000000001	1255.5899999999999	0.96313499999999996	2.1378599999999999	2.0667200000000001	-0.0488	0.9667240000000000315	853.89800000000002	727.79999999999995	870.00900000000001	708.52999999999997	0.81439399999999995	1.0491299999999999	0.99019800000000002	-0.0834	0.9438250000000000316	956.822	820.86400000000003	971.92899999999997	797.23199999999997	0.82025700000000001	1.0821400000000001	0.99068800000000001	-0.1274	0.9154860000000000217	1289.54	1298.7	1303.6500000000001	1255.5899999999999	0.96313499999999996	2.1378599999999999	2.0667200000000001	-0.0488	0.9667240000000000318	2243.5999999999999	1940.0799999999999	2239.9699999999998	1866.1500000000001	0.833117	3.6633200000000001	3.12235	-0.2305	0.8523269999999999519	397.125	418.14299999999997	408.02800000000002	412.327	1.0105299999999999	0.89866999999999997	0.829928	-0.1148	0.9235069999999999720	1734.5799999999999	1675.3800000000001	1738.9200000000001	1613.99	0.92815700000000001	2.4411200000000002	2.4756900000000002	0.0203	1.01416!sample_table_end
