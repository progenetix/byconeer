Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320932/suppl/GSM320932.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3842	3417	3934.8496	3327.5198	0.84565360000000001	1.4737038999999998	1.2364373	-0.2533	0.838999799999999962	3122	3209	3195.5188000000003	3128.0239000000001	0.97887829999999998	1.1144284	1.0726122999999999	-0.0552	0.962477600000000043	1628	1467	1653.2497000000001	1451.2077000000002	0.87779099999999999	0.69406674000000002	0.61678880999999997	-0.1703	0.888659199999999984	5136	5760	5266.6511	5583.3456000000006	1.0601320999999999	2.4840331	2.6269011999999998	0.0807	1.05751465	10398	12555	10646.763000000001	12207.610000000001	1.146603	4.1951187000000001	4.9433441	0.2368	1.17835619999999996	6735	7036	6904.0455000000002	6815.0329000000002	0.98710719999999996	2.9428261	2.9828988999999999	0.0195	1.01361717	2169	2345	2208.4518000000003	2296.973	1.0400829	0.94232504000000006	1.0567838999999999	0.1654	1.12146438	1347	1486	1364.1398000000002	1469.4571000000001	1.0772041999999999	0.61678620000000006	0.65556006	0.0880	1.06286439	3462	3902	3544.9887000000003	3793.6074000000003	1.0701324000000001	1.1440025999999999	1.2066132000000001	0.0769	1.054729410	9569	12069	9809.2402000000002	11726.371000000001	1.1954412999999999	4.4516508999999997	5.1578431	0.2124	1.15863611	19735	19814	19864.612000000001	19540.290000000001	0.98367340000000003	9.5157189999999989	9.1443110999999995	-0.0574	0.9609690000000000712	3521	3286	3605.5459000000001	3202.1570000000002	0.88811989999999996	1.7247169	1.5850867	-0.1218	0.9190417000000000713	2808	3101	2869.5151000000001	3023.9997000000003	1.0538365000000001	1.4358974	1.5121528	0.0747	1.053106499999999914	8852	8714	9079.4471000000012	8442.1537000000008	0.9298092	3.0894415	2.8761383999999999	-0.1032	0.9309574000000000515	2514	2527	2563.9803000000002	2474.6782000000003	0.96517050000000004	1.1683846	1.1277519	-0.0511	0.9652232000000000616	2390	2656	2436.7278000000001	2598.5071000000003	1.066392	1.0441943999999999	1.1851346	0.1827	1.134975099999999917	985	1047	998.45919000000004	1042.261	1.0438693999999999	0.34022316000000002	0.35364658999999998	0.0558	1.039454799999999918	5116	4973	5246.3935000000001	4827.7591000000002	0.9202053	1.7199580999999999	1.6315241	-0.0762	0.9485835999999999719	3581	3709	3667.1375000000003	3607.6474000000003	0.98377749999999997	1.2722281	1.2345447999999999	-0.0434	0.9703800000000000220	1491	1420	1512.1282000000001	1405.972	0.92979679999999998	0.55276471000000005	0.49678052	-0.1541	0.89871970000000001!sample_table_end
