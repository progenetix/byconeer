Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322754/suppl/GSM322754.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1694.97	2146.73	1911.8199999999999	1881.5899999999999	0.98419000000000001	2.6015700000000002	2.5480499999999999	-0.0300	0.979430000000000022	4424.9799999999996	5852.5600000000004	5013.1499999999996	5105.75	1.01847	9.7548200000000005	9.5387900000000005	-0.0323	0.9778543	104.8	111.827	112.68899999999999	109.059	0.96778399999999998	0.16433300000000001	0.17025299999999999	0.0511	1.036034	16372.9	17343.400000000001	17902.599999999999	15654.799999999999	0.87444200000000005	29.263400000000001	26.1404	-0.1628	0.893282000000000025	246.49299999999999	329.14699999999999	266.88200000000001	305.45299999999997	1.14452	0.41378999999999999	0.47635899999999998	0.2032	1.15121000000000016	274.55599999999998	349.02199999999999	298.20999999999998	323.173	1.08371	0.39814300000000002	0.44348500000000002	0.1556	1.113887	1511.04	2025.5599999999999	1701.3900000000001	1777.3199999999999	1.0446299999999999	2.39852	2.4278499999999998	0.0175	1.012238	378.15600000000001	531.91099999999994	413.58999999999997	485.22399999999999	1.1732	0.66368099999999997	0.76411899999999999	0.2033	1.151349	1975.49	2465.54	2231.4200000000001	2156.54	0.96644600000000003	3.2535699999999999	3.1064500000000002	-0.0668	0.9547830000000000510	84.864699999999999	97.583200000000005	91.725200000000001	95.956199999999995	1.04613	0.14027500000000001	0.14418900000000001	0.0397	1.027911	447	518.48900000000003	490.58699999999999	473.38299999999998	0.96493200000000001	0.57461799999999996	0.57266799999999995	-0.0049	0.9966070000000000212	316.18000000000001	406.072	344.40899999999999	373.964	1.0858099999999999	0.46735399999999999	0.51916600000000002	0.1517	1.1108613	2025.3299999999999	2470.6700000000001	2289.4699999999998	2161.1100000000001	0.94393700000000003	2.97018	2.8310900000000001	-0.0692	0.9531699999999999614	1862.27	2314.0700000000002	2100.5100000000002	2029.3	0.96610200000000002	3.0676399999999999	3.0535600000000001	-0.0066	0.9954119999999999615	756.72400000000005	637.01800000000003	841.00900000000001	577.34400000000005	0.68649000000000004	1.4454199999999999	1.04657	-0.4658	0.7240590000000000116	816.72400000000005	827.87199999999996	908.83000000000004	744.33799999999997	0.81900700000000004	1.5714300000000001	1.2585999999999999	-0.3203	0.8009239999999999717	1862.27	2314.0700000000002	2100.5100000000002	2029.3	0.96610200000000002	3.0676399999999999	3.0535600000000001	-0.0066	0.9954119999999999618	2025.3299999999999	2470.6700000000001	2289.4699999999998	2161.1100000000001	0.94393700000000003	2.97018	2.8310900000000001	-0.0692	0.9531699999999999619	316.18000000000001	406.072	344.40899999999999	373.964	1.0858099999999999	0.46735399999999999	0.51916600000000002	0.1517	1.1108620	1192.1300000000001	1532.9400000000001	1337.23	1353.8099999999999	1.0124	2.3510399999999998	2.4243800000000002	0.0443	1.0311900000000001!sample_table_end
