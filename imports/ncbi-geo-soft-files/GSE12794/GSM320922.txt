Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320922/suppl/GSM320922.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1349	1259	1398.2312000000002	1214.6653000000001	0.86871560000000003	0.85799424000000002	0.73650530000000003	-0.2203	0.858403600000000042	1226	1331	1271.6485	1284.3709000000001	1.0100046	0.84824246999999997	0.83824247000000007	-0.0171	0.98821093	1110	1086	1152.8612000000001	1045.8595	0.90718600000000005	0.64110215000000004	0.57937417999999996	-0.1461	0.903715900000000024	5544	6383	5654.9171000000006	6212.9803000000002	1.0986864000000001	3.4567728999999998	3.7738255999999999	0.1266	1.09171930000000015	6382	9611	6486.8330000000005	9436.6573000000008	1.4547403000000001	3.8089155999999997	5.606935	0.5578	1.47205539999999996	4429	4762	4540.5223999999998	4612.3903	1.0158281	2.7555757999999999	2.8296912999999999	0.0383	1.02689659999999997	1300	1636	1347.8679	1575.7376000000002	1.1690594000000001	0.78006023000000002	0.95085200000000003	0.2856	1.21894689999999998	1515	1482	1568.0989000000002	1428.8648000000001	0.91120829999999997	0.86163615999999998	0.78526404999999999	-0.1339	0.91136399	1605	1745	1661.4521	1681.1979000000001	1.0118847	1.0234774	1.0152980999999999	-0.0116	0.9920083000000000710	5977	6454	6084.0892000000003	6283.5198	1.0327789999999999	3.2662168	3.372115	0.0460	1.032422299999999911	7668	6590	7760.2656999999999	6418.6800000000003	0.8271212	4.2650484999999998	3.5295791999999997	-0.2731	0.8275590000000000412	2428	2223	2505.1101000000003	2141.4911000000002	0.85484910000000003	1.4471258	1.2597811999999999	-0.2000	0.8705401999999999913	1177	1315	1221.3706	1269.0759	1.0390588000000001	0.65035914000000006	0.67593742000000001	0.0557	1.039329514	3560	3427	3658.6246000000001	3310.0583000000001	0.90472750000000002	2.5175236999999999	2.2493333999999998	-0.1625	0.893470615	1413	1409	1463.5294000000001	1358.9557	0.92854689999999995	0.74988598000000006	0.69022066000000004	-0.1196	0.9204341000000000316	1166	1579	1210.1618000000001	1521.0404000000001	1.2568902	0.67343125000000004	0.86896963000000005	0.3678	1.290361317	442	421	474.39225000000005	402.83560000000006	0.84916139999999996	0.321857	0.26914599	-0.2580	0.8362285000000000418	2036	1933	2105.6330000000003	1861.9504000000002	0.88427109999999998	1.2694523	1.1633510999999999	-0.1259	0.9164197000000000619	1038	1077	1078.4506000000001	1037.3317	0.96187219999999996	0.68502847	0.63975457000000002	-0.0986	0.9339095000000000620	1400	1252	1450.2842000000001	1207.8552	0.83284040000000004	0.76618885999999997	0.62092223999999996	-0.3033	0.8104036!sample_table_end
