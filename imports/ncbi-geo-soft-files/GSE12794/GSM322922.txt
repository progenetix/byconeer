Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322922/suppl/GSM322922.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	655.23099999999999	528.36400000000003	488.91899999999998	670.74800000000005	1.3718999999999999	0.60611499999999996	0.87409099999999995	0.5282	1.44212000000000012	8523.9099999999999	7910.2200000000003	8211.8400000000001	7830.7200000000003	0.95358799999999999	5.8697299999999997	5.5870899999999999	-0.0712	0.9518473	566.529	372.37799999999999	425.14400000000001	501.00799999999998	1.1784399999999999	0.30966100000000002	0.31616100000000003	0.0300	1.02099000000000014	7365.0299999999997	10103	7068.6400000000003	9904.3500000000004	1.40117	4.9165999999999999	4.9525899999999998	0.0105	1.007325	705.50699999999995	385.01799999999997	529.15599999999995	514.85799999999995	0.97297999999999996	0.34540999999999999	0.32335999999999998	-0.0952	0.936162999999999976	627.26700000000005	379.178	467.66000000000003	508.44099999999997	1.0871999999999999	0.45590799999999998	0.48899399999999998	0.1011	1.072577	767.79600000000005	638.67100000000005	582.60199999999998	788.83100000000002	1.35398	0.82503199999999999	1.1893	0.5276	1.44151999999999998	895.33299999999997	609.86699999999996	699.18499999999995	758.08799999999997	1.0842499999999999	0.73099999999999998	0.81011699999999998	0.1483	1.108239	1728.3699999999999	1049.27	1471.9100000000001	1231.3	0.83652700000000002	1.6713	1.46868	-0.1865	0.8787650000000000210	454.91800000000001	247.22999999999999	361.13999999999999	369.548	1.02328	0.370365	0.40608100000000003	0.1328	1.0964311	537.51099999999997	358.68900000000002	406.20499999999998	486.18000000000001	1.1968799999999999	0.41367599999999999	0.50289600000000001	0.2818	1.215680000000000112	809.02800000000002	370.81099999999998	620.16899999999998	506.46300000000002	0.81665299999999996	0.736016	0.63926899999999998	-0.2033	0.8685530000000000213	2108.9299999999998	1409.0899999999999	1867.0599999999999	1587.45	0.85023599999999999	2.0163500000000001	1.7263599999999999	-0.2240	0.8561790000000000214	2147.4400000000001	1538.52	1890.4300000000001	1723.72	0.91181100000000004	1.85318	1.66587	-0.1537	0.89892615	447.11099999999999	556.88900000000001	353.91399999999999	701.38300000000004	1.9817899999999999	0.27011000000000002	0.345634	0.3557	1.279600000000000116	1628	1185.8499999999999	1399.27	1354.6300000000001	0.96810200000000002	1.3087599999999999	1.2916099999999999	-0.0190	0.9868940000000000517	2147.4400000000001	1538.52	1890.4300000000001	1723.72	0.91181100000000004	1.85318	1.66587	-0.1537	0.89892618	2108.9299999999998	1409.0899999999999	1867.0599999999999	1587.45	0.85023599999999999	2.0163500000000001	1.7263599999999999	-0.2240	0.8561790000000000219	809.02800000000002	370.81099999999998	620.16899999999998	506.46300000000002	0.81665299999999996	0.736016	0.63926899999999998	-0.2033	0.8685530000000000220	2206.9400000000001	3246.9699999999998	1964.71	3377.4000000000001	1.7190300000000001	1.4923599999999999	1.82413	0.2896	1.22231!sample_table_end
