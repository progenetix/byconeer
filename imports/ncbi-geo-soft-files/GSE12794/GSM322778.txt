Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322778/suppl/GSM322778.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1145.9100000000001	1171.48	1207.52	1096.8199999999999	0.90832999999999997	1.98387	1.80257	-0.1383	0.908614000000000032	2559.3499999999999	4380.7799999999997	2708.7800000000002	3983.3299999999999	1.47052	4.5211399999999999	5.9001200000000003	0.3841	1.305013	164.88399999999999	163.37799999999999	164.649	168.45599999999999	1.02312	0.23505999999999999	0.24179899999999999	0.0408	1.028674	9654.2199999999993	9874.7800000000007	10472.1	8912.8600000000006	0.851109	14.892200000000001	13.3523	-0.1575	0.896599999999999955	254.11099999999999	254	259.49900000000002	253.13200000000001	0.97546600000000006	0.39258799999999999	0.37633100000000003	-0.0610	0.958590000000000056	269.53800000000001	221.44	275.887	222.892	0.80791000000000002	0.366392	0.33470699999999998	-0.1305	0.913521000000000037	579.75599999999997	1253.76	606.60400000000004	1171.8499999999999	1.93181	1.38361	2.3740399999999999	0.7789	1.715838	545.14700000000005	667.74199999999996	569.976	635.01900000000001	1.1141099999999999	0.79808999999999997	0.88978900000000005	0.1569	1.11499	2325.3299999999999	2249.3299999999999	2459.1100000000001	2071.79	0.84249600000000002	3.7940299999999998	3.1760000000000002	-0.2565	0.8371039999999999610	133.83000000000001	142.286	133.24600000000001	148.92099999999999	1.11764	0.22629199999999999	0.23431199999999999	0.0502	1.035439999999999911	578.44000000000005	489.97800000000001	605.21699999999998	471.346	0.77880499999999997	0.81266400000000005	0.63897800000000005	-0.3469	0.7862759999999999712	181.37100000000001	205.69200000000001	181.905	208.23500000000001	1.1447400000000001	0.35338000000000003	0.39740599999999998	0.1694	1.1245913	1677.1199999999999	1842.73	1769.3800000000001	1705.27	0.96376600000000001	2.8559199999999998	2.8137799999999999	-0.0214	0.9852459999999999614	2858.9299999999998	3338.1799999999998	3029.5599999999999	3052.48	1.00756	4.8551099999999998	5.14344	0.0832	1.059390000000000115	673.89300000000003	683.97799999999995	706.71100000000001	649.98400000000004	0.91973099999999997	1.0425199999999999	0.98974600000000001	-0.0750	0.9493740000000000516	1802.7	1987.5899999999999	1902.7	1834.8299999999999	0.96433000000000002	2.6646800000000002	2.6187800000000001	-0.0251	0.9827730000000000117	2858.9299999999998	3338.1799999999998	3029.5599999999999	3052.48	1.00756	4.8551099999999998	5.14344	0.0832	1.059390000000000118	1677.1199999999999	1842.73	1769.3800000000001	1705.27	0.96376600000000001	2.8559199999999998	2.8137799999999999	-0.0214	0.9852459999999999619	181.37100000000001	205.69200000000001	181.905	208.23500000000001	1.1447400000000001	0.35338000000000003	0.39740599999999998	0.1694	1.1245920	917.86699999999996	870.86699999999996	965.52700000000004	822.30100000000004	0.85165999999999997	1.45244	1.3497699999999999	-0.1058	0.92930999999999997!sample_table_end
