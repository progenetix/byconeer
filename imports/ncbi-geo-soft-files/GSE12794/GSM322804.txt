Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322804/suppl/GSM322804.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3525.4400000000001	3099.4299999999998	3517.6199999999999	3056.46	0.86890100000000003	3.0388600000000001	2.6829100000000001	-0.1797	0.882869000000000012	5895.0600000000004	5568.3999999999996	5841.5	5515.0200000000004	0.94411	10.3581	9.4731100000000001	-0.1288	0.914564000000000043	204.822	157	195.197	171.464	0.87841599999999997	0.15129799999999999	0.13947899999999999	-0.1173	0.921880999999999954	14516	12703.700000000001	14178.5	12821.5	0.90428900000000001	12.6181	11.7882	-0.0982	0.934228999999999985	527.18700000000001	441	519.68100000000004	453.67000000000002	0.87297800000000003	0.63152399999999997	0.54020599999999996	-0.2253	0.855400000000000056	435.87599999999998	457.48399999999998	427.32499999999999	469.93299999999999	1.09971	0.405671	0.442077	0.1240	1.08973999999999997	3490.0799999999999	4051.4200000000001	3482.6599999999999	3997.5799999999999	1.14785	3.00163	3.5152899999999998	0.2279	1.171138	766.93299999999999	897.67100000000005	761.60599999999999	901.60299999999995	1.1838200000000001	1.0605599999999999	1.2021200000000001	0.1808	1.133489	4465.5699999999997	4721.25	4441.3000000000002	4669.1899999999996	1.05131	4.5027200000000001	4.6883800000000004	0.0583	1.041230000000000110	148.52099999999999	137.48099999999999	140.22	151.74299999999999	1.0821799999999999	0.168158	0.18016199999999999	0.0995	1.071390000000000111	1309.52	1291.22	1308.1800000000001	1286.46	0.98339799999999999	1.09945	1.09162	-0.0103	0.9928850000000000212	680.87400000000002	766.77599999999995	674.61099999999999	773.74800000000005	1.1469499999999999	0.54303900000000005	0.63286699999999996	0.2208	1.165419999999999913	3002.5999999999999	2916.9400000000001	2997.9000000000001	2878.48	0.96016400000000002	2.6130599999999999	2.5208400000000002	-0.0518	0.9647080000000000114	2450.8800000000001	2361.6399999999999	2446.3400000000001	2339.2399999999998	0.95621999999999996	2.2991600000000001	2.2220200000000001	-0.0492	0.96644915	565.91099999999994	571.08900000000006	558.75199999999995	581.73900000000003	1.04114	0.52734099999999995	0.58168600000000004	0.1415	1.103050000000000116	772.84900000000005	780.09799999999996	767.58500000000004	786.97699999999998	1.0252600000000001	1.1202799999999999	1.10206	-0.0237	0.98373817	2450.8800000000001	2361.6399999999999	2446.3400000000001	2339.2399999999998	0.95621999999999996	2.2991600000000001	2.2220200000000001	-0.0492	0.96644918	3002.5999999999999	2916.9400000000001	2997.9000000000001	2878.48	0.96016400000000002	2.6130599999999999	2.5208400000000002	-0.0518	0.9647080000000000119	680.87400000000002	766.77599999999995	674.61099999999999	773.74800000000005	1.1469499999999999	0.54303900000000005	0.63286699999999996	0.2208	1.165419999999999920	1958.9300000000001	1933.78	1960.71	1912.8299999999999	0.97558100000000003	1.9240600000000001	1.95268	0.0213	1.0148699999999999!sample_table_end
