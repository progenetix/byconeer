Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320934/suppl/GSM320934.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1048	705	939.9226000000001	801.30690000000004	0.85252433000000005	0.64758526000000005	0.56641817000000005	-0.1932	0.874661930000000032	1798	1595	1643.4045000000001	1732.1158	1.0539802199999999	0.99243093999999998	1.0988092999999999	0.1469	1.10718969999999993	1010	787	904.93420000000003	886.0313000000001	0.97911119999999996	0.51721296999999999	0.52456948999999997	0.0204	1.01422339999999994	9626	6571	8994.7628000000004	6909.0052000000005	0.76811421999999996	5.8764379	4.6326141999999999	-0.3431	0.788337139999999995	8846	9577	8259.9484000000011	9970.6332000000002	1.2071059799999999	4.5206849999999994	5.8807239999999998	0.3795	1.3008486	6913	5547	6446.3836000000001	5847.5974000000006	0.90711286000000002	4.1657574999999998	3.9775499999999999	-0.0667	0.954820360000000037	1972	1767	1805.3959	1916.6970000000001	1.06164916	0.84292833	0.99425223000000007	0.2382	1.17952178	1534	1556	1397.7219	1691.6421	1.2102851299999999	0.79518531999999997	0.95735354000000006	0.2678	1.20393759999999999	1650	1385	1506.1805000000002	1514.9811	1.005843	0.80797366000000004	0.85362419	0.0793	1.056510	6457	6217	6015.0944	6540.2043000000003	1.0872987000000001	3.6775289	3.5881334999999996	-0.0355	0.9756914399999999711	5922	5456	5508.8330000000005	5753.4426000000003	1.0444031600000001	3.3223224999999998	3.2200946999999998	-0.0451	0.9692300099999999812	8470	6192	7908.5627000000004	6514.1473000000005	0.82368284000000003	4.6479824000000001	3.7135604	-0.3238	0.7989618000000000613	1583	1409	1443.5510000000002	1540.1453000000001	1.06691435	0.75690763000000005	0.70943756999999996	-0.0934	0.9372842214	5000	4435	4642.2791999999999	4701.0252	1.0126545499999999	3.7930962999999998	4.0218103999999997	0.0845	1.060297499999999915	1958	1457	1792.3757000000001	1589.7138	0.88693111000000002	0.90425032000000005	0.77808621	-0.2168	0.8604765716	1546	1742	1408.9598000000001	1889.5196000000001	1.3410740999999999	0.75503430999999999	1.0381689000000001	0.4594	1.374995699999999917	496	276	414.25420000000003	350.32560000000001	0.84567780000000004	0.25841374	0.22965782000000001	-0.1702	0.8887214100000000418	2224	1681	2038.0050000000001	1823.7191	0.89485506000000004	1.1397747	1.0757264	-0.0834	0.9438062099999999819	1224	924	1107.5291	1028.6762000000001	0.92880289000000005	0.62148906999999998	0.58982508	-0.0754	0.9490514100000000420	1481	1214	1348.1218000000001	1333.8294000000001	0.98939832999999999	0.91531388000000002	0.77091292	-0.2477	0.84223886000000003!sample_table_end
