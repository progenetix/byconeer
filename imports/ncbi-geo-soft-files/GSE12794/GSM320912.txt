Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320912/suppl/GSM320912.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2936	2272	2938.1730000000002	2239.4529000000002	0.76219230000000004	1.5899018999999999	1.3037737999999999	-0.2862	0.820034099999999992	1119	1134	1130.3763000000001	1129.3790000000001	0.99911779999999994	0.62635406999999999	0.66139009000000004	0.0785	1.05593643	1996	1892	2003.7650000000001	1870.0822000000001	0.93328420000000001	1.0456087000000001	1.0696775000000001	0.0328	1.02301890000000014	7094	5611	7061.7604000000001	5494.2786999999998	0.77803239999999996	4.2511703999999995	3.4685960999999996	-0.2935	0.815915599999999965	10418	12927	10296.106	12695.347	1.2330241	5.0846212999999993	6.9741371999999995	0.4559	1.37161389999999986	5760	5752	5746.7909	5630.9210000000003	0.97983750000000003	3.2443963	3.4643572999999996	0.0946	1.06779727	1951	2044	1958.6877000000002	2015.5595000000001	1.0290357000000001	1.018165	1.1810168999999999	0.2141	1.15994639999999998	1223	1426	1234.8647000000001	1416.7248	1.1472713000000001	0.75488920999999998	0.83991678999999997	0.1540	1.11263579999999989	2347	2290	2353.8797	2257.2302	0.95894040000000003	1.3307422	1.3370579999999999	0.0068	1.004746110	4087	5425	4082.2887000000001	5314.2791999999999	1.3017890999999999	3.8022719999999999	4.0814795999999998	0.1022	1.073431811	6408	7740	6388.7433000000001	7573.9452000000001	1.1855141	5.5014669999999999	5.7002499999999996	0.0512	1.036132712	4480	4012	4473.9068000000007	3934.3468000000003	0.87939849999999997	3.0602668999999998	2.7399488000000001	-0.1595	0.8953300000000000713	1938	2373	1945.6639	2339.2096000000001	1.2022681	1.7246675	1.8877066999999998	0.1303	1.094533699999999914	9753	8820	9655.0348000000013	8630.6743999999999	0.89390400000000003	4.7000554999999995	4.6102479999999995	-0.0278	0.9808921999999999915	1842	1985	1851.4918	1958.6223	1.0578616999999999	1.3019892	1.3287122	0.0293	1.020524716	2016	2239	2023.7994000000001	2206.8602000000001	1.090454	1.1367779	1.3253086999999999	0.2214	1.165846699999999917	1165	1351	1176.7446	1343.2073	1.1414603999999999	0.63442076000000003	0.74665872	0.2350	1.176914099999999918	4087	3690	4082.2887000000001	3619.6714000000002	0.88667700000000005	1.8609342	1.8509970999999998	-0.0077	0.9946601999999999919	1408	1684	1419.4865	1672.4370000000001	1.1781986	0.88366193999999998	1.0396728	0.2346	1.176550420	1036	1156	1047.6239	1151.1204	1.0987917	0.91788941000000002	0.80137844000000003	-0.1958	0.87306640000000002!sample_table_end
