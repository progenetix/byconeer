Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322876/suppl/GSM322876.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1985.29	1745.3499999999999	2010.76	1674.54	0.83278799999999997	2.4076499999999998	1.99333	-0.2724	0.827918000000000042	9316.3299999999999	10584	9138	10169.9	1.11293	9.9242699999999999	10.730600000000001	0.1127	1.081253	178.578	89.236000000000004	161.06100000000001	113.57899999999999	0.70519500000000002	0.13686799999999999	0.117489	-0.2203	0.858412999999999984	13360.299999999999	12632.6	13019.700000000001	12307.6	0.94530999999999998	10.655799999999999	12.672000000000001	0.2500	1.18925	451.80000000000001	440.95999999999998	455.88600000000002	447.27800000000002	0.98111999999999999	0.40694599999999997	0.43684400000000001	0.1023	1.07346999999999996	279.43599999999998	223.489	271.69900000000001	241.214	0.88780000000000003	0.28323300000000001	0.274783	-0.0437	0.9701637	1973.9000000000001	2740.9899999999998	1999.48	2607.3200000000002	1.304	3.0894200000000001	3.6330499999999999	0.2339	1.175978	1313.3	1580.3299999999999	1341	1520.1099999999999	1.13357	1.3462499999999999	1.4615400000000001	0.1185	1.08563999999999999	5535.7299999999996	5234.6499999999996	5473.46	4943.6000000000004	0.90319400000000005	6.46272	5.3494400000000004	-0.2728	0.8277379999999999710	145.678	88.664000000000001	125.81100000000001	113.02500000000001	0.89836499999999997	0.16527700000000001	0.132608	-0.3177	0.8023369999999999711	140.22200000000001	62.643999999999998	120.259	86.205799999999996	0.71683699999999995	0.11533599999999999	0.085165099999999994	-0.4375	0.7384119999999999612	513.41499999999996	515.21100000000001	520.67399999999998	517.68799999999999	0.99426499999999995	0.73154600000000003	0.68303400000000003	-0.0990	0.9336849999999999913	3193.77	3232.04	3198.4200000000001	3062.6799999999998	0.95755800000000002	3.7124999999999999	3.6594000000000002	-0.0208	0.9856960000000000214	2743.0100000000002	2881.3899999999999	2754.0100000000002	2739.1500000000001	0.99460300000000001	3.1422500000000002	3.21672	0.0338	1.023700000000000115	792.02200000000005	665.75999999999999	810.77800000000002	660.20600000000002	0.81428699999999998	0.69886199999999998	0.75253499999999995	0.1068	1.076816	944.51300000000003	827.95799999999997	968.29399999999998	813.69799999999998	0.84034200000000003	0.99362600000000001	0.84604999999999997	-0.2320	0.8514770000000000417	2743.0100000000002	2881.3899999999999	2754.0100000000002	2739.1500000000001	0.99460300000000001	3.1422500000000002	3.21672	0.0338	1.023700000000000118	3193.77	3232.04	3198.4200000000001	3062.6799999999998	0.95755800000000002	3.7124999999999999	3.6594000000000002	-0.0208	0.9856960000000000219	513.41499999999996	515.21100000000001	520.67399999999998	517.68799999999999	0.99426499999999995	0.73154600000000003	0.68303400000000003	-0.0990	0.9336849999999999920	2809.27	2361.1300000000001	2823.2800000000002	2251.5500000000002	0.79749199999999998	2.49254	2.8371300000000002	0.1868	1.13825!sample_table_end
