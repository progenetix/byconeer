Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320916/suppl/GSM320916.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1598	1677	1668.3875	1601.1106	0.95967550000000001	1.0534209999999999	1.0003293	-0.0746	0.949600700000000082	1817	2010	1902.1267	1916.1871000000001	1.0073919	1.2935026999999999	1.2855185	-0.0089	0.993827499999999973	924	1014	966.08647000000008	972.87787000000003	1.0070298	0.58936107000000004	0.59283249999999998	0.0085	1.00589019999999984	3654	3976	3834.0594000000001	3770.7537000000002	0.98348860000000005	2.4726076999999997	2.4218687999999999	-0.0299	0.979479600000000015	5038	6307	5276.1977999999999	5994.2442000000001	1.1360916000000001	3.3415287999999999	3.8782117	0.2149	1.16060999999999996	4208	4792	4413.9182000000001	4542.4974000000002	1.0291303999999999	2.8786867999999997	2.9770490999999999	0.0485	1.03416917	1788	1983	1871.058	1890.711	1.0105036999999999	1.1312605999999998	1.2547264	0.1494	1.109148	1041	1203	1087.3226999999999	1151.3433	1.0588791	0.66318412000000004	0.70046450000000005	0.0789	1.05621419999999999	2286	2883	2394.8696	2736.9212000000002	1.1428267999999999	1.5581320999999999	1.7690199	0.1831	1.135346599999999910	7690	9260	8002.8547000000008	8874.9261999999999	1.10897	5.1218354000000001	5.6660238999999999	0.1457	1.106248699999999911	7344	7809	7651.0294000000004	7449.3220000000001	0.97363659999999996	5.0884887000000001	4.9698513999999996	-0.0340	0.9766850999999999712	2191	2203	2294.5089000000003	2097.6660000000002	0.91421129999999995	1.5461307	1.4782538999999999	-0.0648	0.9560988999999999713	1689	1989	1765.1850000000002	1896.384	1.0743259000000001	1.3939227999999999	1.5221171999999998	0.1269	1.091966599999999914	3557	3445	3732.5782000000004	3268.9064000000003	0.87577709999999998	2.5480665	2.2098964999999997	-0.2054	0.8672836999999999915	2182	2239	2285.0578	2131.4695999999999	0.93278589999999995	1.4033472	1.3302974999999999	-0.0771	0.9479461000000000116	1540	1881	1608.7412000000002	1794.2578000000001	1.1153179	1.0074589	1.1953422999999999	0.2467	1.186492399999999917	671	751	702.94040000000007	720.86850000000004	1.0255044	0.45654348	0.46132327000000001	0.0150	1.010469499999999918	2253	2348	2359.8203000000003	2233.0752000000002	0.94629039999999998	1.6131599999999999	1.5362534999999999	-0.0705	0.9523255999999999919	1560	1767	1629.3136000000002	1686.1393	1.0348771000000001	1.0789294999999999	1.1034705999999999	0.0324	1.022745820	1049	983	1095.6484	943.33863000000008	0.86098660000000005	0.70863342000000007	0.59530238999999996	-0.2514	0.84007100000000001!sample_table_end
