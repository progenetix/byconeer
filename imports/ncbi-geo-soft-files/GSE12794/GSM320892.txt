Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320892/suppl/GSM320892.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2817	1887	2457.9399000000003	2168.1750000000002	0.88211070000000003	0.90539782000000002	0.85234549000000004	-0.0871	0.941404400000000032	3324	3295	2919.3045999999999	3669.3695000000002	1.2569326999999999	1.1756606999999999	1.5561438999999999	0.4045	1.32363349999999993	1585	1515	1352.7033000000001	1761.1478000000002	1.3019468000000001	0.58863980000000005	0.78098983	0.4079	1.32677034	8222	8161	7435.5596000000005	8651.8206000000009	1.1635736000000001	3.4496952999999997	4.1033341999999999	0.2503	1.18947729999999985	11075	13260	10089.52	13848.478000000001	1.3725605999999999	5.1460938999999994	7.2415181999999998	0.4928	1.40718729999999996	6792	4683	6105.7235000000001	5111.0189	0.83708649999999996	2.7469161999999998	2.3925643000000001	-0.1993	0.871000100000000057	1521	1726	1296.4371000000001	1992.9250000000002	1.5372323000000001	0.75427695000000006	1.1534740999999999	0.6128	1.52924479999999988	1897	1681	1629.4728	1943.8324	1.1929209999999999	0.86983056999999997	1.0077301999999999	0.2123	1.15853619999999999	3126	2231	2742.1465000000003	2539.2570000000001	0.92601069999999996	1.014413	1.0051733	-0.0132	0.9908915000000000410	5789	5383	5194.0610999999999	5822.7060000000001	1.1210315	3.3627260999999997	3.3801237999999998	0.0074	1.005173700000000111	7480	6180	6738.4110000000001	6628.9897000000001	0.98376160000000001	4.1724049000000001	3.7922872999999999	-0.1378	0.9088972000000000712	4212	3776	3737.8359	4173.3024999999998	1.1165023000000001	2.1739221999999998	2.3697909999999998	0.1245	1.090099299999999913	979	851	829.49619000000007	1015.7783000000001	1.2245725999999999	0.57267139	0.62162439999999997	0.1183	1.085481799999999914	8105	8341	7326.5607	8835.2270000000008	1.2059173999999999	3.455797	4.4295105999999995	0.3581	1.281762399999999915	1687	1346	1442.8904	1571.5940000000001	1.0891985	0.80937802999999997	0.83377804	0.0428	1.030146599999999916	1197	2002	1016.7519000000001	2292.2157000000002	2.2544493999999999	0.57624448000000006	1.3071358	1.1817	2.268370200000000117	584	396	497.01896000000005	486.45842000000005	0.97875219999999996	0.20182335000000001	0.20752988	0.0402	1.028274799999999918	4202	3161	3728.6930000000002	3526.9847	0.94590370000000001	1.4734943999999999	1.5069439999999998	0.0324	1.022700919	1444	1029	1229.2606000000001	1216.7714000000001	0.98984000000000005	0.51656761000000007	0.53783159999999997	0.0582	1.04116420	1513	1189	1289.4544000000001	1396.8664000000001	1.0833003999999999	0.75841744	0.73868049000000002	-0.0380	0.97397610000000001!sample_table_end
