Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320924/suppl/GSM320924.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1987	1881	2069.4357	1809.0307	0.87416618999999995	0.65111642000000003	0.55622875999999999	-0.2272	0.854269300000000012	3847	4602	3992.2850000000003	4415.2527	1.1059462799999999	1.4142051999999998	1.4913474	0.0766	1.05454809999999993	1534	1739	1595.8779000000002	1676.5738000000001	1.05056522	0.50840291999999998	0.53434336000000004	0.0718	1.05102340000000014	14767	13738	14859.742	13404.829	0.90209026000000003	4.9286234000000002	4.4190898999999995	-0.1574	0.896617470000000035	18031	20814	18031.427	20537.758000000002	1.13899795	6.2842349999999998	7.4944962999999998	0.2541	1.19258696	6781	7019	6975.3229000000001	6771.0709000000006	0.97071792000000001	2.3707216999999998	2.2991829999999998	-0.0442	0.969824070000000047	1490	1902	1549.8995	1828.5161000000001	1.1797643	0.62029062000000001	0.81299558999999999	0.3903	1.31066888	2148	2294	2237.0579000000002	2202.1928000000003	0.98441476000000006	0.74943190000000004	0.74158142999999999	-0.0152	0.989524770000000059	2529	3106	2633.2665000000002	2976.5576000000001	1.1303670299999999	0.86946354000000003	0.93745920000000005	0.1086	1.078204200000000110	10293	10738	10478.612000000001	10422.293	0.99462527999999994	3.7432251999999999	3.7065091999999997	-0.0142	0.9901913700000000211	9094	9310	9296.9231	9019.4413999999997	0.97015337999999995	3.1926041000000001	3.1410383999999998	-0.0235	0.9838483900000000212	5457	4817	5640.2511000000004	4623.8235000000004	0.81979036000000005	2.2656130000000001	1.9883246999999999	-0.1883	0.8776100399999999813	1593	1699	1657.4142000000002	1638.9782	0.98887667999999995	0.73141416000000004	0.71664696000000006	-0.0294	0.9798100800000000314	8703	8869	8906.5184000000008	8587.4803000000011	0.96417925999999998	3.2012180999999997	2.9684573999999997	-0.1089	0.9272899399999999815	2419	2696	2518.7948000000001	2585.3876	1.0264383699999999	0.83920791000000006	0.90058267000000003	0.1018	1.073134199999999916	1748	2218	1819.6521	2130.2422000000001	1.17068657	0.74285544000000003	0.94834045	0.3523	1.276615099999999917	420	482	430.50710000000004	481.26283000000006	1.11789753	0.15236294	0.16285223000000001	0.0961	1.068844118	3068	3124	3190.5036	2993.7470000000003	0.93833054999999999	1.1126768	1.0481056	-0.0863	0.9419676599999999819	1335	1526	1388.6560000000002	1473.6638	1.06121592	0.49536923999999999	0.49794468000000003	0.0075	1.00519920	1906	1929	1985.1629	1853.558	0.93370571000000002	0.71460518000000006	0.62322321000000003	-0.1974	0.87212243!sample_table_end
