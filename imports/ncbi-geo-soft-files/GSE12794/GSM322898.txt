Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This was done in colour reversal and this is the primary experiment.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7314!Sample_contact_name = Vladimir,,Grubor!Sample_contact_email = grubor@cshl.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 6314550848!Sample_contact_fax = 5163678381!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road  !Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM322nnn/GSM322898/suppl/GSM322898.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12794!Sample_data_row_count = 357519#ID_REF = unique probe ID corresponding to ID column in platform description#F635.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F532.MEAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOWRATIO = Ratio of the two lowess normalised values for each probe#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE: lowess, local normalized B-CLL/PMN#PRE_VALUE = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEAN	F532.MEAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOWRATIO	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	843.404	897.77800000000002	816.69799999999998	925.96900000000005	0.881992	0.61241500000000004	0.70893499999999998	-0.2111	0.863851999999999952	13159.799999999999	13835.700000000001	12751.4	13932.5	0.91522700000000001	9.8371899999999997	10.0131	-0.0256	0.9824333	205.76900000000001	189.74199999999999	183.679	219.86699999999999	0.83540899999999996	0.12983900000000001	0.15060899999999999	-0.2141	0.8620934	11036.799999999999	11237.6	10739.1	11277.700000000001	0.95223899999999995	7.1057499999999996	7.2046000000000001	-0.0199	0.986280000000000055	344.48899999999998	294.15600000000001	315.94600000000003	324.59100000000001	0.97336699999999998	0.246757	0.24021400000000001	0.0388	1.02723999999999996	428.75599999999997	458.92000000000002	400.54000000000002	488.81900000000002	0.81940299999999999	0.297039	0.36638700000000002	-0.3027	0.8107247	5078.2200000000003	3787.5799999999999	5007.3900000000003	3787.1999999999998	1.32219	3.4566599999999998	2.6706300000000001	0.3722	1.294338	597.93299999999999	719	570.52300000000002	748.29100000000005	0.76243399999999995	0.40446599999999999	0.52993599999999996	-0.3898	0.7632359	3722.8600000000001	3454.6900000000001	3670.5799999999999	3466.0599999999999	1.05901	2.5853899999999999	2.4578199999999999	0.0730	1.051900000000000110	221.20599999999999	165.26300000000001	198.45599999999999	195.78899999999999	1.01362	0.12881699999999999	0.123319	0.0629	1.044580000000000111	626.73299999999995	503.28899999999999	599.39800000000002	532.928	1.12473	0.37791599999999997	0.346667	0.1245	1.090140000000000112	432.64100000000002	369.63600000000002	404.10700000000003	400.04199999999997	1.0101599999999999	0.27824399999999999	0.28264400000000001	-0.0226	0.98443313	4364.7700000000004	3403.5	4281.9499999999998	3438.0999999999999	1.2454400000000001	3.0328300000000001	2.4642300000000001	0.2995	1.230739999999999914	5506.6400000000003	6226.8400000000001	5422.8299999999999	6228.2600000000002	0.87068199999999996	3.9959199999999999	4.6082299999999998	-0.2057	0.8671259999999999515	405.60000000000002	285.68900000000002	377.19600000000003	316.08199999999999	1.1933499999999999	0.28299200000000002	0.22853399999999999	0.3084	1.238316	3645	3793.6500000000001	3603.3600000000001	3795.5599999999999	0.94936299999999996	2.6214400000000002	2.72532	-0.0561	0.9618830000000000417	5506.6400000000003	6226.8400000000001	5422.8299999999999	6228.2600000000002	0.87068199999999996	3.9959199999999999	4.6082299999999998	-0.2057	0.8671259999999999518	4364.7700000000004	3403.5	4281.9499999999998	3438.0999999999999	1.2454400000000001	3.0328300000000001	2.4642300000000001	0.2995	1.230739999999999919	432.64100000000002	369.63600000000002	404.10700000000003	400.04199999999997	1.0101599999999999	0.27824399999999999	0.28264400000000001	-0.0226	0.98443320	3503.5799999999999	3667.3299999999999	3465.4299999999998	3667.1399999999999	0.94499599999999995	2.2508900000000001	2.27596	-0.0160	0.98898200000000003!sample_table_end
