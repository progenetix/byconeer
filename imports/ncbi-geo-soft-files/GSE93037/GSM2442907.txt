DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = none!Sample_data_processing = Data was genotyped by Birdsuite; CHP data in tables was processed by Affymetrix Power Tools (CHP files not provided)!Sample_data_processing = Genotypes (typical .inp format) for each individual in matrix_processed_data.txt. Each line in the processed data includes genotypes of one lolus for all individuals.Take the first locus for example, A represents the corresponding individual habors homozygotes of the first allele in column 6, that is C allele for rs6650104. B, homozygotes of the second allele in column 6; H, heterozygotes containing both alleles in column 6; U and N represent missing data.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Chao,,Zhang!Sample_contact_institute = Partner Institute for Computational Biology (PICB)!Sample_contact_address = 320 Yueyang Road!Sample_contact_city = Shanghai!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 200031!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2442nnn/GSM2442907/suppl/GSM2442907_3B1-X155.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE93037!Sample_data_row_count = 0
