Equal amounts of labelled tumor and reference DNA were mixed and unincorporated fluorochromes were removed using Bioprime Array-CGH Purification Module.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = blood from a pool of healthy individuals!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: blood!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Genomic DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instruction!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Approximately 1.2 Î¼g of DNA was labelled by random priming using 1.4 Î¼l of 1 mmol/L Cy3-dCTP or Cy5-dCTP  according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of labelled tumor and reference DNA were mixed and unincorporated fluorochromes were removed using Bioprime Array-CGH Purification Module.!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was then precipitated with 140 Âµl of blocking mix, 6 Î¼l of yeast  tRNA 10 mg/ml  0.1 V/V of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2 and 2 V/V of absolute ethanol. The DNA pellet was dissolved in 10 Î¼l of distilled water and 30 Î¼l of hybridization solution.  After denaturation at 72Â°C for 10 min and incubation at 37Â°C for 30 min, the solution was applied to the array. Hybridization was done at 42Â°C for 40 hrs.  Finally, the slides were washed according to the supplierâs instructions, dried by spinning in a centrifuge for 5 min at 1000 rpm and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned on VersaArray ChipReader scanner (Biorad). Images were analyzed using BlueFuse version 3.5 software (BlueGnome)!Sample_data_processing = In the arrays each clone was spotted in quadruplicate. Spots were excluded when the quality flag was < 1, the confidence value < 0.3 or the standard deviation of quadruplicate > 0.2.  Log2 ratios of spots that were not excluded were normalized using block median or block lowess approaches. Alteration analysis was performed using aCGH-Smooth approach,  implemented in BlueFuse version 3.5 software, and Hidden Markov Model!Sample_platform_id = GPL11286!Sample_contact_name = Chiara,,Molinari!Sample_contact_email = c.molinari@irst.emr.it!Sample_contact_department = Bioscience Laboratories!Sample_contact_institute = IRST(Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori)!Sample_contact_address = via Maroncelli 40!Sample_contact_city = Meldola!Sample_contact_state = FC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 47014!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM635nnn/GSM635446/suppl/GSM635446.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE25885!Sample_data_row_count = 3589#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (test/reference) of clones that were not excluded and that come from the replicates fusion!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUERP1-101G11	0.048RP1-105K17	-0.038RP1-108M6	-0.011RP11-100A11	-0.023RP11-100C21	0.015RP11-100C23	-0.12RP11-100C9	0.075RP11-100E13	0.016RP11-100E6	0.057RP11-100F13	0.029RP11-100J16	-0.063RP11-100N20	0.006RP11-100N21	0.028RP11-100N3	0.048RP11-100P11	-0.035RP11-101A9	-0.045RP11-101D2	-0.055RP11-101E7	-0.072RP11-101J4	0.009RP11-101K10	-0.043!sample_table_end
