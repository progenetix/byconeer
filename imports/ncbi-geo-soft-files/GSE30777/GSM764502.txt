Propidium iodide was added to a concentration of 1 Î¼g/mL to discriminate dead cells, and viable CD19+ and CD3+ single-positive cells were sorted on a high-speed FACSAria cell sorter (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA).  Buccal swabs were used as normal controls in eleven cases.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = The DNA was prepared for hybridization to Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays according to the manufacturer's recommendations.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Affymetrix Hybridization Oven 640 for 16 hrs at 50 deg C with rotation at 60 rpm. Washing and staining was done on an Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanning was done using an Affymetrix Scanner 3000 7G with autoloader.!Sample_description = CLL088T!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix CEL files for each DNA sample were analyzed using Affymetrix's Genotyping Console software for initial quality control, followed by use of the Affymetrix âBirdseedâ algorithm to determine final call rates and quality. Call rates for the entire group of CD19+ samples included in this report were between 95.06% and 99.63%, with a mean call rate of 98.53%. Corresponding call rates for CD3+ or buccal DNA were between 93.14% and 99.66%, with a mean call rate of 98.49%. Sample copy number heatmap displays were obtained from CEL files through use of the freely available software dChip adapted to operate in a 64-bit environment.!Sample_data_processing = dChip SNP software (www.dchip.org), build date Feb 25, 2009, compatible with 64-bit OS, analyzed the CEL files.  CEL files were normalized using the invariant set method, followed by model-based expression index calculations, and finally inferred copy number data were generated using the software's median-smoothing algorithm.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sami,N,Malek!Sample_contact_email = smalek@med.umich.edu, pouillet@med.umich.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 734-763-1222!Sample_contact_department = Internal Medicine, Hematology-Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Michigan!Sample_contact_address = 4410 Cancer Center; 1500 E Medical Center Dr!Sample_contact_city = Ann Arbor!Sample_contact_state = MI!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 48109!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM764nnn/GSM764502/suppl/GSM764502_Malek_CLL-88or89-T-2_GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE30777!Sample_data_row_count = 909508#ID_REF = #VALUE = inferred copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-8575125	2.200SNP_A-8575115	2.200SNP_A-8575371	2.230SNP_A-8709646	2.200SNP_A-8497791	2.230SNP_A-1909444	2.230SNP_A-8358063	2.230SNP_A-8329892	1.910SNP_A-8408912	1.910SNP_A-1886933	1.910SNP_A-2236359	1.880SNP_A-8515688	1.880SNP_A-2205441	2.030SNP_A-8524447	2.180SNP_A-8573955	2.120SNP_A-8530278	2.120SNP_A-8573668	2.120SNP_A-8573414	1.810SNP_A-8531044	1.690SNP_A-8530320	1.690!sample_table_end
