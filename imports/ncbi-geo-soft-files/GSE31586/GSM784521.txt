Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um. Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in dual colour microarray!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7313!Sample_contact_name = Yi,,Su!Sample_contact_laboratory = Powers Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Lab!Sample_contact_address = 500 Sunnyside Blvd!Sample_contact_city = Woodbury!Sample_contact_state = New York!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11746!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM784nnn/GSM784521/suppl/GSM784521_KN1163.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31586!Sample_data_row_count = 83011#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 of Test/Reference ratio after lowess and local normalization#PRE_VALUE = Test/Reference ratio after lowess and local normalization!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	-0.2002	0.870400912	0.2102	1.1568283	-0.3890	0.763634624	0.1314	1.09536735	-0.0487	0.966805526	0.2094	1.15619337	0.0594	1.04204148	0.0900	1.06433999	-0.1266	0.9159640110	0.0198	1.013841611	-0.7013	0.6150360712	-0.1395	0.9078320313	-0.3867	0.7648919214	-0.3391	0.7905293715	-0.0788	0.9468262216	-0.5462	0.6848269117	0.0352	1.024722918	-0.1679	0.8901469119	-0.0537	0.9634929920	-0.1187	0.9210431!sample_table_end
