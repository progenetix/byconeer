Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714402/suppl/GSM714402.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	-0.3262053341118641421614	-0.1041621790289175625469	0.1780132529814019728383	0.4570325860519878727	-0.20891127210935676520	-0.532492475850991510890	-0.584749919615380914569	-0.5196227898479127130	0.2286157323342460611653	1416	-0.0214755558474526819111	0.534550119394937619756	-0.420880754058671533609	0.1791075771886150625591	-0.2554101457045191432861	0.3433742190832176424132	-0.02178193611420842232882	0.347090480577294228512	0.0936616828786897322670	-0.0953567787690728!sample_table_end
