Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714399/suppl/GSM714399.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	-0.1082676584473686621614	-0.3460162279566063625469	28383	0.43659562458073238727	-0.122744838172730876520	-0.3642524966478456510890	-0.3063128205172370714569	0.1468585365654695727130	0.163768367202574311653	0.039800677304750311416	19111	0.4210156381347847619756	0.3843152682912322533609	0.434765789760390325591	0.255019195041027132861	24132	0.3494650563711978532882	0.5298368127916328512	0.699847404250460422670	0.03406430060808849!sample_table_end
