Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714412/suppl/GSM714412.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	0.1157124717477639621614	-0.0731729844277918425469	0.2334250666741858328383	0.143961744476553058727	-0.031353355278027656520	-0.351105878043427310890	-0.1234938087239423614569	0.01239197884223138827130	-0.0738390145477156911653	-0.303262858576073551416	-0.355841873527320319111	0.0578298509476093919756	0.01807812419969955633609	-0.4075788130582976325591	-0.2554292478624788432861	-0.539293888636330424132	-0.505751020741670332882	-0.2678731634762886428512	-0.0978384978348859622670	-0.3067816360980622!sample_table_end
