Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714415/suppl/GSM714415.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	-0.02049078238280025621614	0.06000203890724075525469	0.00997824090740207828383	-0.205857322460098368727	-0.382320953971092066520	0.1022566883698204610890	0.059151392522154114569	0.0626384773186124327130	0.372572140475699911653	0.143969993415530321416	0.3714384094791650719111	0.959609706232126319756	0.631132783188423833609	25591	0.699575796829587132861	0.539513975780421524132	0.682708924826801932882	0.443644576250143528512	0.534763220926482722670	0.6806584151332968!sample_table_end
