Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714384/suppl/GSM714384.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	-0.2383537096909287821614	-0.2200031822711435425469	0.01304341833363970928383	0.154298364909977458727	-0.21267574997031616520	-0.2027266767146957410890	-0.00976336199564513414569	0.149938513414376127130	-0.145340539860445211653	-0.33989958656432941416	0.599292773243042319111	0.4859163413596971319756	0.181226582649695733609	-0.102649746321078125591	32861	0.222440541651920824132	0.287929847324692232882	0.0653826239924937728512	0.0718948653175583422670	!sample_table_end
