Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714416/suppl/GSM714416.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	-0.2430240369598391821614	-0.2751339528236659325469	-0.548654268062686828383	-0.45577845328841628727	-0.382996758691099676520	-0.515840452167518710890	-0.0926840231912406714569	-0.305881329673518127130	-0.401416910150721711653	-0.221980017738334031416	0.2008231022866058519111	19756	0.066124198316108633609	-0.415788594828635825591	0.0601793769982222532861	-0.2598154072658052624132	0.379218590959266632882	0.2351391736694024628512	0.3742501410694485422670	0.3150447191387348!sample_table_end
