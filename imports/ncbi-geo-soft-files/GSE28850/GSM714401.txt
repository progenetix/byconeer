Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714401/suppl/GSM714401.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	0.1043993342584154121614	-0.1223855101358995725469	0.1122359669831342228383	0.215948492526195758727	-0.0478870338402937056520	-0.2346218890964561510890	-0.1096946666992202214569	0.2349873802093846727130	0.088177266536681611653	0.04281219800731211416	0.360194154950098519111	19756	0.349565363238475133609	0.04345251170778812625591	0.3916527544687612432861	24132	0.2597857769123767532882	0.196854238617948428512	0.0407161133842281822670	0.47698129924931343!sample_table_end
