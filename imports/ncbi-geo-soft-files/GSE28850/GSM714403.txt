Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714403/suppl/GSM714403.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	-0.1060119228579392721614	0.01016279790549489225469	0.354556395752753928383	0.395001381507451238727	-0.318014767418424276520	-0.281284783984215510890	-0.3961948640717411514569	-0.3017223522831272727130	0.0296564557468445511653	1416	-0.1150873032506212219111	0.0615746377252380319756	0.068821913256371133609	0.05801512476008493425591	-0.3858311691348475532861	-0.00667955634235436124132	-0.1843722350446598832882	0.1048166345587890928512	22670	-0.3099416825341407!sample_table_end
