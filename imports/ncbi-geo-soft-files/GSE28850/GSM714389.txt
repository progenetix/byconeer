Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714389/suppl/GSM714389.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	0.1446288802764275321614	0.1479650511154518625469	0.1925031912857492828383	0.040045522821226168727	-0.41382890011769276520	0.02716957623947385810890	14569	0.001101293818086690327130	0.00475846220602694111653	0.14586048654932151416	0.37077123508229219111	19756	0.320004878409727133609	-0.0850934910285606625591	0.1533602820404403332861	0.2670394886302085424132	32882	0.122755980462763228512	22670	0.281339209907866!sample_table_end
