Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714381/suppl/GSM714381.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	-0.1470747460324524621614	0.00663345517984546125469	28383	0.0618464585772536968727	0.41140877904248096520	-0.259856901629798610890	0.02501627324223872414569	0.2893958050987760527130	0.348157941577806911653	-0.039066486510760921416	0.727567186453085819111	0.932507300798858819756	0.4177341273469905633609	0.1890453834544907325591	0.463671680161949232861	0.2601321249876703524132	0.333464949728531732882	28512	0.406641056089583622670	0.17033838069568374!sample_table_end
