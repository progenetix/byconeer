Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714391/suppl/GSM714391.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	0.3010785890989453621614	-0.1125841609389801625469	-0.00752815516865019728383	0.025683367904681678727	6520	-0.05248944498763230510890	-0.1713598967514260414569	-0.278333248318361627130	0.1225237190803227811653	-0.02959110359632411416	0.2023031213958095519111	19756	0.2109898658970294833609	0.032331635821831525591	0.1730287429153364632861	-0.0350934166158368724132	0.0272439523566936732882	0.0763190499019519928512	0.2949154955089565722670	-0.02117789555809281!sample_table_end
