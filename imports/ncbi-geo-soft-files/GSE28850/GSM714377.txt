Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714377/suppl/GSM714377.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	-0.1103319181821772321614	-0.1211640421434736125469	-0.1780328091541987528383	0.00343002832334675778727	-0.164392558235794966520	-0.140771099493558810890	0.0882920055409924214569	-0.3098363774347412427130	-0.0644362393615590311653	-0.058242100457025661416	0.1379829188761658719111	-0.1013264607063438519756	0.2244257249349838333609	0.340237146600135425591	0.140864561716665832861	0.473324617213057524132	0.414600524083208432882	28512	0.3182443526666997622670	0.3150706686474911!sample_table_end
