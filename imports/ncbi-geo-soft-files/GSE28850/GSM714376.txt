Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714376/suppl/GSM714376.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	0.2720000651093429421614	0.0418935879938081425469	-0.2327984434425128383	0.202736435684307778727	-0.0151715403585184866520	-0.0565609626708852210890	-0.1861877028619358414569	-0.1946313007677663327130	-0.0905266751270030611653	0.215858195926480781416	0.30657629920893419111	1.090927683654711719756	0.685135299306707433609	0.374293222637812525591	0.59543033781222532861	0.831866519575139524132	0.644515647969731232882	0.637350445066860828512	22670	0.6431765932260755!sample_table_end
