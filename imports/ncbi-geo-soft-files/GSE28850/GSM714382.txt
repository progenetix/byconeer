Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714382/suppl/GSM714382.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	-0.0611861284187661621614	0.14880917348369925469	0.4088469596099577628383	0.452994243347107978727	-0.244843359929124986520	-0.1760690553701188310890	0.540499630596481514569	0.1363858718602505627130	0.1093120831318405411653	-0.19922720234636811416	1.605301125855013619111	0.834811949627832619756	0.338762811402259333609	0.3805120249803677425591	0.1367152914933869332861	0.317490154232916524132	32882	0.3696719841640100428512	0.370259363638097422670	0.047665056401053306!sample_table_end
