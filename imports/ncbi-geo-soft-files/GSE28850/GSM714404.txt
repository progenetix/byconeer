Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714404/suppl/GSM714404.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	-0.1434183794098120621614	0.1499468630451372725469	-0.03566098316909918628383	-0.052737647860803148727	-0.170046641756622936520	-0.1376395573139039310890	0.4104647118643549614569	0.4719601093381544727130	0.2371518168412956311653	0.149422131558642671416	0.440644984032878219111	19756	0.275741330476973533609	0.3208179726373972525591	0.4916482342019951632861	0.666942069142151724132	0.85417310504011332882	0.654180394537022328512	0.645414928169968922670	0.9527756642988441!sample_table_end
