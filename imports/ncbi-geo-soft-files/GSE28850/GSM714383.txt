Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714383/suppl/GSM714383.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	0.1347156052296131221614	25469	-0.266340079240737128383	-0.084342365282671928727	6520	-0.2473449212269400510890	0.4158758345233331514569	0.30008062803767627130	-0.181098082129073111653	-0.250394014485419761416	0.264775181163765119111	19756	0.466811728540595533609	0.0566914893681452725591	0.142429725809148632861	0.1141488421938459424132	0.168573073644185232882	-0.01087253170039308528512	-0.214851209340360422670	0.05907011800159692!sample_table_end
