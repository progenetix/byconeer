Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714380/suppl/GSM714380.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	0.01490077000443678721614	-0.1705701381730618825469	-0.2724398940979959628383	-0.0524362934336207258727	-0.320008604955627446520	-0.1699494153550471210890	-0.498094588715209514569	-0.256001176366073327130	-0.2492774455725816611653	0.06086397264027821416	0.228050635045879719111	1.275365530469236219756	0.553614232430143833609	0.231247110102056425591	0.333814350726910632861	0.854211056240425724132	0.382055407153489432882	0.2971848578875499528512	-0.0319466127129562822670	0.2723502512920819!sample_table_end
