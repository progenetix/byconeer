Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714398/suppl/GSM714398.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	-0.1836112900605175721614	25469	-0.0934394195248201128383	-0.208639895404350688727	-0.231303588846758426520	-0.291582686138702410890	-0.2130370417400811214569	-0.1589051039785173727130	-0.0913361577553801911653	-0.44401511894390661416	0.353217679058263419111	19756	-0.0078287440687241133609	0.35954077914075525591	-0.06233721391165420632861	0.0612931109720376424132	0.2478228589038325732882	0.05836713210516475428512	0.0819037980271043222670	!sample_table_end
