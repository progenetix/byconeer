Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714379/suppl/GSM714379.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	-0.1001047003463615721614	-0.1924227567427241325469	-0.2050163926575421228383	-0.177227708579813018727	-0.022913549415822816520	-0.461810922712172210890	-0.308392137515086914569	-0.295431968209873127130	-0.309356315319939411653	0.26264634160887341416	0.04036876729066446519111	1.32876261024533919756	1.162760722143495733609	0.880182608749786325591	1.021262428469097232861	0.829699047443009524132	0.681187130925006932882	28512	0.1592006480917580722670	0.9163342830764067!sample_table_end
