Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714394/suppl/GSM714394.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	0.0376392804845454521614	0.1690895194086336225469	-0.0281480297726261128383	-0.141393017884818928727	6520	0.1053791379758245610890	14569	0.2999317073776570627130	-0.0045669393850660311653	-0.186214383909248741416	-0.3546040156947933319111	19756	-0.1097520514501160333609	0.215470116881179725591	0.0544792931014200132861	0.125493505206755424132	0.2090023433769728832882	0.1038040133573035628512	-0.2468590050547575822670	0.007217176827757286!sample_table_end
