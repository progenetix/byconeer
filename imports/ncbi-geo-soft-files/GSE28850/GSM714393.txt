Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714393/suppl/GSM714393.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	-0.1261985548484461621614	25469	0.3208215328209309528383	-0.121721205097486058727	6520	-0.154479078791197710890	0.0727366869855075214569	-0.1053206114793880427130	0.2179988185401510511653	-0.035502474477460611416	0.639766377246815219111	1.06658425586373219756	0.392892298324643333609	0.1317094582973256425591	0.681439313054208832861	0.481586476438415124132	0.3238240945010033632882	0.38494373214245328512	0.4331884693664742622670	!sample_table_end
