Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714385/suppl/GSM714385.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	21614	0.0763684292031193425469	0.05519694763007839528383	0.039484433873440218727	6520	-0.4242037848036780410890	0.3857165393998962514569	0.1289126767764715327130	-0.2050245743477930611653	1416	0.0947705778140650919111	0.0797432577274043319756	33609	0.1150158933025059325591	-0.0874144430045052432861	-0.2426343107914246424132	-0.3320655435367118632882	0.130465940031504228512	-0.2140922335303841222670	-0.44415201385412834!sample_table_end
