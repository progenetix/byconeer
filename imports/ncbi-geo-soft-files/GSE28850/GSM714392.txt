Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714392/suppl/GSM714392.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	0.251368265792442721614	0.4483121912174093425469	0.261795208435349728383	0.355052833625519548727	0.29455472170567096520	-0.043388557039068410890	-0.00880363811631322214569	27130	11653	0.48528748694396671416	0.7359351977761519111	1.033554263269164619756	0.1553225078850239733609	-0.046242403537136525591	32861	0.394066010593888924132	0.308272363044982532882	28512	-0.05810234870012994522670	!sample_table_end
