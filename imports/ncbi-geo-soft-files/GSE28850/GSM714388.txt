Positive and nonsaturated spots were background corrected using the median background intensities for each channel and log2 ratios were calculated from the background corrected intensities. Data were filtered for flagged features and spots below signal to noise ratio 3 for both channels were eliminated. Data was normalized using an implementation of a population based LOWESS algorithm (Staaf et al., 2007).!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Katarina,,Bartuma!Sample_contact_email = katarina.bartuma@med.lu.se!Sample_contact_institute = department of Oncology!Sample_contact_address = Barn garan 2b!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 221 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM714nnn/GSM714388/suppl/GSM714388.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28850!Sample_data_row_count = 31919#ID_REF = #VALUE = lowess normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE16114	-0.1341023458504889721614	-0.503367691402265325469	-0.424190840837914328383	-0.15683278335645888727	-0.464760449168983856520	-0.683146517853547210890	14569	-0.68214022239545127130	-0.563275926144106911653	-0.53610757207750341416	-0.0557058162377423219111	0.2229654004797415319756	-0.3203090140945004733609	-0.4043859554524509325591	-0.0484813134147942432861	-0.398372059936994624132	-0.342743433643007132882	-0.57916994956319828512	-0.410828995880906122670	-0.28806459531349743!sample_table_end
