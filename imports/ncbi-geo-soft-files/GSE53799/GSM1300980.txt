Then, 24 of the samples on a plate were subjected to treatment with Nsp I restriction enzyme. After inactivation of the restriction enzyme, the sticky ends of the digested DNA were ligated to Nsp I adaptor/primers using T4 ligase. Aliquots from each ligated product were added to four separate plates for PCR amplification using a universal primer. The products of all four PCR reactions for each subject were combined and then purified with purification magnetic beads in 1.5ml microtube. The yield of each amplified DNA sample was assessed by UV spectrophotometry on a microplate reader. Any DNA showing lower than expected yield (â¥ 3mg/ml) or an unusual size distribution was flagged and not processed further. Subsequently, each DNA was fragmented between 25 to 125 bp using partial DNase I digestion and the size distribution of the fragmented amplicons assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis (4% agarose in Tris-Acetate-EDTA buffer).!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = The end-labeled products were added to a hybridization solution, denatured, and added to a CytoScanâ¢ HD Array (one array per sample).!Sample_hyb_protocol = Samples passing these QC steps were next end-labeled with a biotinylated nucleoitde using Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT). The end-labeled products were added to a hybridization solution, denatured, and added to a CytoScanâ¢ HD Array (one array per sample).!Sample_scan_protocol = After hybridization was complete, the DNA sample was removed from each microarray and replaced with Array Holding Buffer. Arrays were then washed on the Fluidics Station 450 using AGCC software (Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Command Console, Version 3.2.2) This protocol includes 6 cycles of 5 mixes/cycle with low stringency Wash Buffer A (6X SSPE, 0.01% Tween-20) at 25â followed by 24 cycles of 5 mixes/cycle with high stringency Wash Buffer B (0.6X SSPE, 0.01% Tween-20) at 45â. Binding of the biotinylated targets was detected by incubating the array for 10 min in a StreptavidinâPhycoerythrin (SAPE) solution at 25â followed by a post stain wash comprised of 6 cycles of 5 mixes/cycle with Wash Buffer A at 25â. A second round of staining was then completed using a 10 min incubation in Anti-Streptavidin Antibody Stain Solution at 25â followed by a third stain for 10 min in SAPE solution at 25â and a final wash consisting of 10 cycles of 6 mixes/cycle with Wash Buffer A at 30â, filling of the array with Array Holding Buffer, and a hold at 25â.!Sample_data_processing = Data processing of CEL files was done using Nexus Copy Number 6.1 software!Sample_data_processing = Primary data description: 15 files of triplet pairs of normal, primary colorectal carcinoma and matched liver metastases tissues!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = SUN YOUNG,,LEE!Sample_contact_email = farhanhaqj@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = Asan Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = Olympicro!Sample_contact_city = Seoul!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 138-736!Sample_contact_country = South Korea!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1300nnn/GSM1300980/suppl/GSM1300980_CytoScanHD_10-353N.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1300nnn/GSM1300980/suppl/GSM1300980_CytoScanHD_10-353N.P_.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1300nnn/GSM1300980/suppl/GSM1300980_CytoScanHD_10-353N.P_.cyhd.cychp.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE53799!Sample_data_row_count = 0
