After post-hybridization washes, the arrays were mounted in a solution containing 90% glycerol, 10% PBS and 1 uM DAPI and sealed with a cover slip.!Sample_scan_protocol = A custom built CCD camera system was used to acquire 16 bit 1024x1024 pixel DAPI, Cy3 and Cy5 images (Pinkel et al., 1998 and Hamilton et al. 2006). Image analysis was carried out using UCSF SPOT software (Jain et al., 2002).!Sample_description = n/a!Sample_data_processing = The log2ratio of the total integrated Cy3 and Cy5 intensities for each spot after background subtraction was calculated, normalized to the median log2ratio of all the clones on the array and the average of the triplicates calculated using a second custom program, SPROC. Automatic data filtering to reject data points based on low DAPI intensity, low correlation between Cy3 and Cy5 within each segmented spot and low reference/DAPI signal intensity was also carried out using SPROC. Data files were subsequently manually edited by rejecting clones for which only one spot of the triplicate survived after SPROC analysis and for which the standard deviation of the log2ratio of the triplicate was >0.2. For each tumor, the data are plotted as the mean log2ratio of the triplicate spots for each clone normalized to the genome median log2ratio. The clones are ordered by position in the genome (UCSC draft genome sequence, July 2003 freeze) beginning at 1p and ending with Xq.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7298!Sample_contact_name = Serena,S,kwek!Sample_contact_email = serena.kwek@ucsf.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 415-514-9301!Sample_contact_laboratory = Donna Albertson!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Research Institute!Sample_contact_institute = UCSF!Sample_contact_address = 2340 Sutter St.!Sample_contact_city = San Francsico!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94143-0808!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320185/suppl/GSM320185_S0127spot.txt.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM320nnn/GSM320185/suppl/GSM320185_ratios.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE12761!Sample_data_row_count = 378#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (Cy3/Cy5)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESerenaSK1_B18	0.385465H12.1RefCloneSet_G8	0.043996H12.1RefCloneSet_G11	-0.026347H12.1RefCloneSet_G14	-0.026622H12.1RefCloneSet_G17	-0.148031H12.1RefCloneSet_G20	-0.04288H12.1RefCloneSet_G23	-0.092496H12.1RefCloneSet_E8	0.158021H12.1RefCloneSet_E11	-0.048779H12.1RefCloneSet_E17	H12.1RefCloneSet_E9	0.057821H12.1RefCloneSet_E15	-0.083303H12.1RefCloneSet_E18	-0.035686H12.1RefCloneSet_E21	-0.219934H12.1RefCloneSet_E24	-0.010671H12.1RefCloneSet_J7	H12.1RefCloneSet_J10	-0.008327H12.1RefCloneSet_J16	0.010935H12.1RefCloneSet_J22	-0.004571H12.1RefCloneSet_F1	0.139!sample_table_end
