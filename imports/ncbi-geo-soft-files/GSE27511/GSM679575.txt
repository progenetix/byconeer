Using this protocol, we isolated small pools of highly purified CTCs from breast cancer patients. DNA from Tumor cells sorted in 10uL of TE was amplified using the GenomePlex Single Cell Whole Genome Amplification Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to manufacturerâs protocol. The approach was evaluated using breast tumor cell model systems, BT474 and MCF7, and CTCs metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients.

Briefly, DNA suspended in 11uL of water and 10uL of random prime mix was heated for 10mins at 100C and snap cooled on ice. 2.5uL of 10x-dNTP mix (8uL of 100mM dATP, 8uL of 100mM dGTP, 8uL of 100mM dTTP, 4uL of 100mM dCTP, 2uL 1M Tris, 0.4uL of 0.5M EDTA, and water), 1uL of Cy3 or Cy5 labeled dCTP( 1mM) and 0.6uL Exo-Klenow (40 U/uL) were added to the denatured DNA and incubated for 12 -20 hours at 37C. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a Sephadex G-50 spin-columns.!Sample_hyb_protocol = We combined and precipitated 30 uL Cy3 labeled test DNA, 30 uL Cy5 labeled reference DNA and 100 ug human Cot-1 DNA by adding 0.1 volumes of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 2.5 volumes of ice-cold ethanol. We collected the precipitate by centrifugation  at 14000 rpm for 45 minutes at 4C. We the final hybridization mixture containing 7ul dH20, 14uL  20% SDS, and 49 uL or Master Mix (5 mL ultra pure formamide from Invitrogen, 1g 500000MW Dextran Sulfate, 1mL 20xSSC, 1mL H20). We denatured the hybridization mixture at 73C for 15 min and then incubated the samples at 37C for 2hours to allow the Cot 1 DNA to anneal to repetitive DNA sequeces on both the sample and reference DNA. We exposed our printed arrays to 260000uJoules of UV using StrataLinker and applied a rubber cement ring around each array to form a well. After air drying the rubber cement we added our combined sample/reference hybridization solution onto the array. We placed a silicone gasket around the edge of the wells and laid a clean glass microscope slide on top of the gasket. We clamped the assembly together using binder clips to create an air tight environment. The arrays were incubated or 48-68 hours at 37C on a slowly rocking table (1rpm). After disassembling the hybridization chamber, we rinsed off the excess hybridization fluid with PN buffer (PN: 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 0.1% nonidet P40, pH 8), then washed the arrays once in a solution containing 50% formamide in 2xSSC for 15 min. at 45C and finally in PN buffer at room temperature for 15 min. We removed the ring of rubber cement, drained excess liquid from the arrays, mounted them in a solution containing 90% glycerol, 10% PBS and 1 mM DAPI, and sealed them with a cover slip.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were imaged using a custom built CCD array imaging system  and analyzed using the UCSF Spot Program to calculate Cy3/Cy5 ratios.!Sample_description = Sample name: 117548_20CTC!Sample_description = Matched TLDA sample name: CTC.117548.20CTC.1!Sample_description = Matched TLDA sample Accession Number: GSM998051!Sample_data_processing = The aCGH data from our cohort were processed by the custom program SPROC in order to automatically filter out data points with low DAPI intensity, low correlation between Cy3 and Cy5 within each spot, and low reference/DAPI signal intensity. Clones whose ratios were derived from only one of the triplicate spots or with a triplicate log2 SD >0.2 were set as missing. The tumor data was filtered for unmapped clones and poorly performing ones identified as those missing in more than 50% of the tumor samples. A second set of triplicate spots for 38 of these clones were averaged resulting in a total of 1965 clones remaining after processing. The data were mapped to the May 2004 freeze of the human DNA sequence.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6359!Sample_contact_name = Mark,,Magbanua!Sample_contact_laboratory = Park!Sample_contact_department = HemOnc!Sample_contact_institute = UCSF/Helen Diller Familiy Comprehensive Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = 1450 3rd Street, PO Box 589001!Sample_contact_city = San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94158-9001!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM679nnn/GSM679575/suppl/GSM679575_2010_12_10_117548_20CTC_1_SPOT.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE27511!Sample_series_id = GSE40622!Sample_data_row_count = 1956#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 test/reference ratios!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEHA3.2P2_P36	0.390972HA3.2P1_D28	0.087295HA3.2P1_H36	0.130732HA3.2P1_H28	-0.031478HA3.2P1_L28	-0.093168HA3.2P1_D25	-0.012606HA3.2P1_P28	-0.061351HA3.2P1_B16	-0.163361HA3.2P1_J16	0.039588HA3.2P1_A30	-0.055488HA3.2P1_N16	-0.081071HA3.2P1_R16	0.012533HA3.2P2_H46	-0.072055HA3.2P1_A8	0.040754HA3.2P1_H25	0.059214HA3.2P1_Z16	-0.049934HA3.2P1_V16	0.185401HA3.2P1_B20	0.176706HA3.2P1_AA48	HA3.2P1_E30	!sample_table_end
