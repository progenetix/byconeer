DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_data_processing = Quality control (QC), genotype calling and probe level normalization were performed in the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) 4.1. The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC and genotype calls were made using BRLMM (34). Copy number normalization was performed in order to produce log2ratios using the Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT) 4.0.1. Eighty-two normal samples analyzed at the Uppsala Array Platform were used as reference set.!Sample_data_processing = Standard Affymetrix CNCHP files with Log2 probe intenisities relative to reference!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Anders,,Isaksson!Sample_contact_email = anders.isaksson@medsci.uu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Akademiska sjukhuset ing61 3tr!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75185!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM693nnn/GSM693470/suppl/GSM693470.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM693nnn/GSM693470/suppl/GSM693470.cnchp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28030!Sample_data_row_count = 262217#ID_REF = #VALUE = CN STATE#CHROMOSOME = #POSITION = #LOG2 RATIO = #HMM MEDIAN LOG2 RATIO = #NEG LOG10 P-VALUE = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CHROMOSOME	POSITION	LOG2 RATIO	HMM MEDIAN LOG2 RATIO	NEG LOG10 P-VALUESNP_A-1886933	NC	1	775852	-0.133789	-0.133789	nanSNP_A-1902458	NC	1	1120590	0.470793	0.358779	nanSNP_A-2131660	NC	1	1145994	0.246764	0.358779	nanSNP_A-4221087	NC	1	1258710	0.141493	-0.065821	nanSNP_A-1884606	NC	1	1495898	-0.015563	-0.065821	nanSNP_A-2235839	NC	1	1711339	-0.078148	-0.065821	nanSNP_A-2218153	NC	1	1743546	0.168498	-0.065821	nanSNP_A-1919019	NC	1	1748886	-0.084320	-0.065821	nanSNP_A-1815933	NC	1	1748914	0.184236	-0.065821	nanSNP_A-2115098	NC	1	1813782	-0.117727	-0.065821	nanSNP_A-2264565	NC	1	2094841	-0.409713	-0.065821	nanSNP_A-1788728	NC	1	2095738	-0.077383	-0.065821	nanSNP_A-4218776	NC	1	2145729	-0.212655	-0.065821	nanSNP_A-2082194	NC	1	2273173	0.117063	-0.065821	nanSNP_A-2135694	NC	1	2292771	0.052844	-0.065821	nanSNP_A-4220764	NC	1	2296012	-0.065821	-0.065821	nanSNP_A-1796345	NC	1	2310562	0.461531	0.461531	nanSNP_A-1789472	NC	1	2442429	-0.243550	-0.439978	nanSNP_A-1934233	NC	1	2495573	-0.636406	-0.439978	nanSNP_A-4207031	NC	1	2536089	0.077960	0.010315	nan!sample_table_end
