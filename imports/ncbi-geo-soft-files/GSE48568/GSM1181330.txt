Cells not grown past 80% confluencey for attached cells, or 0.5 x 10^6 cells for suspended. Trypsinize (for attached cells) cells with 5 ml trypsin-EDTA per T162, for 15 min., at 37C. Spin down suspended cells, and resuspend in ~3ml growth media. Count cells. Pass 1x10^6 cells into new T162's w 30 ml media. Repeat growth cycle until desired amount of cells are available.
