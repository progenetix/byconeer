The arrays were enclosed in a rotating hybridization oven at 65Â°C for 40 h. After hybridization, the slides were sequentially washed and dried.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were scanned on an Agilent High-Resolution C Microarray Scanner (G2505B) and the images were quantified using Agilent Feature Extraction Software (v.9.1).!Sample_data_processing = Data analysis was carried out using Nexus Copy Number software v.4.1 (BioDiscovery Inc., El Segundo, CA, USA), which uses the Rank segmentation algorithm to define non-random regions of CNAs across the genome. Sex chromosomes were excluded from the analysis. The significance threshold for segmentation was set to p=1.0E-6 and the thresholds of log2 ratio values for gain and loss were 0.25 and â0.2, respectively; the thresholds for high copy number gain/amplification and homozygous deletion were 1.0 and â1.0, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Marta,,Persson!Sample_contact_email = marta.persson@llcr.med.gu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Sahlgrenska Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = Box 425!Sample_contact_city = Gotenburg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 405 90!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM855nnn/GSM855780/suppl/GSM855780_USA-ACC9-7261.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34816!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	1.456620001e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	1.074744598e-0015	4.098412274e-0026	-5.691691967e-0027	1.370653403e-0018	3.628802323e-0019	1.697157895e-00110	1.728509517e-00211	-1.796342118e-00112	-1.956830715e-00413	-6.794621674e-00214	1.372640164e-00115	4.390547139e-00216	-7.063720266e-00217	-5.914835406e-00218	3.010048277e-00219	-2.722626590e-00120	8.286688031e-002!sample_table_end
