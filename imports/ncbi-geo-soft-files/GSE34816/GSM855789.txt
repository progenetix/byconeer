The tumors were classified as grade I to III according to the histologic classification of salivary gland tumours by WHO.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was isolated from frozen tumour tissue using the QIAampR DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 2.0 Âµg of genomic tumor DNA and sex-matched reference DNA (Promega p/n G1471) were digested with AluI and Rsa1 for 2 h at 37 1C. Digested tumor and reference DNAs (1.5 mg of each) were labeled with Cy3-dUTP and Cy5-dUTP (Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences Inc., Wellesley, MA, USA), respectively.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Normal tissue!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: M!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = sample type: sex-matched reference DNA (Promega p/n G1471)!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Fresh tumor tissue from 40 ACCs were obtained from surgical resection specimens.

Digested tumor and reference DNAs (1.5 mg of each) were labeled with Cy3-dUTP and Cy5-dUTP (Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences Inc., Wellesley, MA, USA), respectively.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Oligoarray control targets (Cot-1 DNA and Blocking agent) and hybridization buffer (Agilent oligo aCGH/ChIP-on-Chip Hybridization Kit) were added, the samples were denatured and applied to microarrays (Agilent Human Genome CGH Microarray 244K 60-mer oligonucleotide arrays) as recommended by the manufacturer. The arrays were enclosed in a rotating hybridization oven at 65Â°C for 40 h. After hybridization, the slides were sequentially washed and dried.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were scanned on an Agilent High-Resolution C Microarray Scanner (G2505B) and the images were quantified using Agilent Feature Extraction Software (v.9.1).!Sample_data_processing = Data analysis was carried out using Nexus Copy Number software v.4.1 (BioDiscovery Inc., El Segundo, CA, USA), which uses the Rank segmentation algorithm to define non-random regions of CNAs across the genome. Sex chromosomes were excluded from the analysis. The significance threshold for segmentation was set to p=1.0E-6 and the thresholds of log2 ratio values for gain and loss were 0.25 and â0.2, respectively; the thresholds for high copy number gain/amplification and homozygous deletion were 1.0 and â1.0, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Marta,,Persson!Sample_contact_email = marta.persson@llcr.med.gu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Sahlgrenska Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = Box 425!Sample_contact_city = Gotenburg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 405 90!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM855nnn/GSM855789/suppl/GSM855789_USA-ACC29-7344.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34816!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	4.034406518e-0022	-3.492569347e-0013	-2.376203240e-0014	1.964393779e-0025	-9.549940682e-0026	6.139862896e-0027	1.072834565e-0018	-1.694219787e-0029	-8.531612263e-00310	-8.083986440e-00211	-4.077039489e-00212	1.573019027e-00213	-1.386153319e-00214	-3.906120489e-00215	2.907258144e-00216	-1.104991708e-00117	-3.644757249e-00218	-7.786531930e-00119	-2.804360146e-00120	6.669085549e-002!sample_table_end
