The arrays were enclosed in a rotating hybridization oven at 65Â°C for 40 h. After hybridization, the slides were sequentially washed and dried.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were scanned on an Agilent High-Resolution C Microarray Scanner (G2505B) and the images were quantified using Agilent Feature Extraction Software (v.9.1).!Sample_data_processing = Data analysis was carried out using Nexus Copy Number software v.4.1 (BioDiscovery Inc., El Segundo, CA, USA), which uses the Rank segmentation algorithm to define non-random regions of CNAs across the genome. Sex chromosomes were excluded from the analysis. The significance threshold for segmentation was set to p=1.0E-6 and the thresholds of log2 ratio values for gain and loss were 0.25 and â0.2, respectively; the thresholds for high copy number gain/amplification and homozygous deletion were 1.0 and â1.0, respectively.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Marta,,Persson!Sample_contact_email = marta.persson@llcr.med.gu.se!Sample_contact_institute = Sahlgrenska Cancer Center!Sample_contact_address = Box 425!Sample_contact_city = Gotenburg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 405 90!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM855nnn/GSM855772/suppl/GSM855772_C1076-2606.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34816!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio Cy5/Cy3!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	-6.757987390e-0032	0.000000000e+0003	0.000000000e+0004	-1.687922196e-0015	-1.231276382e-0016	8.344312606e-0027	-7.322014411e-0028	9.000305597e-0029	-9.787898915e-00210	0.000000000e+00011	-1.860031501e-00112	7.588919394e-00213	-1.205747002e-00114	1.457848981e-00115	1.013474089e-00116	-1.403974932e-00117	1.100973511e-00118	0.000000000e+00019	-5.144070425e-00220	-2.240852249e-001!sample_table_end
