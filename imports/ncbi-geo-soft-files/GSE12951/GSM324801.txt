After mixing by inversion the DNA was collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 g and 4Â°C, the supernatant aspirated and the pellet air-dried for approximately 5-10 min. The pellet was then dissolved in 13 Âµl water and 26 Âµl 20% SDS taking care to prevent foam formation. After incubating at room temperature for 15 min 91 Âµl of Master mix (14.3 % (w/v) dextran sulphate (USB), 71% (v/v) formamide (Invitrogen), 2.9 X SSC pH 7.0 (Sigma)) was added and gently mixed. The hybridization solution was then incubated at 73Â°C for 10 min to denature the DNA and subsequently at 37Â°C for 60 min to allow the Cot-1 DNA to block repetitive sequences. Hybridization and washing was done automatically using a GeneTAC/HybArray12 hybstation (Genomic Solutions / Perkin Elmer). Hybridization was for 38 h at 37Â°C. Subsequently slides were washed 6 cycles (flow for 10 s, hold for 20 s) with 50% (v/v) formamide, 2X SSC, 2 cycles with phosphate-buffer (0.1 M Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 0.1% (v/v) Igepal CA630 (Sigma)), 2 cycles with 0.2 X SSC (Sigma) and 2 cycles with 0.1 X SSC. Slides were then taken out of the hybstation and briefly rinsed in 0.01 X SSC, dried by centrifugation for 3 min at 1000 g and scanned using a Microarray Scanner G2565AB (Agilent Technologies).!Sample_data_processing = Spot analysis and quality control was fully automated using BlueFuse version 3.4 (BlueGnome, Cambridge, UK). Spots were excluded when the quality flag was less than 1, the Confidence value less than 0.3 when stdev was larger than 0.2 or when no chromosomal mapping information was available. Log2ratioâs of spots that were not excluded after quality flagging and mapping were normalized to their median value.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE12951!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #CONFIDENCE = The Confidence Estimate in the calculated ratio, between 0 and 1, calculated by BlueFuse#AMPCH1 = Total signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#AMPCH2 = Total signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#LOG2RATIO CH1/CH2 = Log, base 2, of the ratio of total signal in channel 1 divided by total signal in channel 2#QUALITY = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (1 acceptable; 0 not acceptable), estimated by BlueFuse#VALUE = Median normalized value of the log2ratio, replicates are fused by BlueFuse, features with confidence < 0.1 or stdev > 0.2 quality 0 are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	CONFIDENCE	AMPCH1	AMPCH2	LOG2RATIO CH1/CH2	QUALITY	VALUE1	0.27	300.903	1074.425	-1.836	0	2	0.46	885.625	2612.514	-1.561	0	3	0.47	791.723	2818.652	-1.832	0	4	0.01	59.394	15.781	1.912	0	5	0.01	46.361	18.051	1.361	0	6	0.01	19.852	33.495	-0.755	0	7	0.89	4134.274	12061.682	-1.545	1	0.0358	0.89	4118.748	12211.811	-1.568	1	0.0359	0.89	3933.442	11553.663	-1.554	1	0.03510	0.03	83.399	177.507	-1.09	0	11	0.04	114.777	117.447	-0.033	0	12	0.14	346.754	159.653	1.119	1	13	0.89	2924.27	8242.662	-1.495	1	0.08614	0.99	2656.069	7566.793	-1.51	1	0.08615	0.89	2661.125	7572.973	-1.509	1	0.08616	0.04	157.724	129.702	0.282	1	17	0.03	167.878	110.723	0.6	1	18	0.03	98.395	128.385	-0.384	1	19	0.89	3854.03	11046.489	-1.519	1	0.03520	0.89	3837.793	10791.966	-1.492	1	0.035!sample_table_end
