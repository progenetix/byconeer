After mixing by inversion the DNA was collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 g and 4Â°C, the supernatant aspirated and the pellet air-dried for approximately 5-10 min. The pellet was then dissolved in 13 Âµl water and 26 Âµl 20% SDS taking care to prevent foam formation. After incubating at room temperature for 15 min 91 Âµl of Master mix (14.3 % (w/v) dextran sulphate (USB), 71% (v/v) formamide (Invitrogen), 2.9 X SSC pH 7.0 (Sigma)) was added and gently mixed. The hybridization solution was then incubated at 73Â°C for 10 min to denature the DNA and subsequently at 37Â°C for 60 min to allow the Cot-1 DNA to block repetitive sequences. Hybridization and washing was done automatically using a GeneTAC/HybArray12 hybstation (Genomic Solutions / Perkin Elmer). Hybridization was for 38 h at 37Â°C. Subsequently slides were washed 6 cycles (flow for 10 s, hold for 20 s) with 50% (v/v) formamide, 2X SSC, 2 cycles with phosphate-buffer (0.1 M Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 0.1% (v/v) Igepal CA630 (Sigma)), 2 cycles with 0.2 X SSC (Sigma) and 2 cycles with 0.1 X SSC. Slides were then taken out of the hybstation and briefly rinsed in 0.01 X SSC, dried by centrifugation for 3 min at 1000 g and scanned using a Microarray Scanner G2565AB (Agilent Technologies).!Sample_data_processing = Spots were quantified in Feature Extraction software version 9.1 (Agilent Technologies) using default settings.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5477!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE12951!Sample_data_row_count = 45214#ID_REF = #SIG_MEDIAN_CH1 = spot signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#SIG_MEDIAN_CH2 = spot signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#BACKGR_MEDIAN_CH1 = background signal in channel 1#BACKGR_MEDIAN_CH2 = background signal in channel 2#VALUE = Normalized value of the log2ratio (Cy3/Cy5)!sample_table_beginID_REF	SIG_MEDIAN_CH1	SIG_MEDIAN_CH2	BACKGR_MEDIAN_CH1	BACKGR_MEDIAN_CH2	VALUE1	2336.5	6388	59	85	2	69	112	56	83	3	62	103	54	81	4	60	105	55	82	5	58.5	110	52	81	6	61	108	52	80	7	60	106.5	52	80	8	62	116	53	80	9	61	113	55	80	10	62	104.5	55	81	11	63	100.5	54	81	12	357	898	53	80	0.5213	452	1386	52	79	0.2414	893	3506	51	78	-0.0815	235	902	53	78	-0.2316	350	1516	52	78	-0.3217	378.5	1231.5	52	79	18	202	713.5	52	78	-0.1319	135.5	655.5	53	79	-0.8520	238	810	51	78	-0.02!sample_table_end
