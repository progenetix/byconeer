After mixing by inversion the DNA was collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 g and 4Â°C, the supernatant aspirated and the pellet air-dried for approximately 5-10 min. The pellet was then dissolved in 13 Âµl water and 26 Âµl 20% SDS taking care to prevent foam formation. After incubating at room temperature for 15 min 91 Âµl of Master mix (14.3 % (w/v) dextran sulphate (USB), 71% (v/v) formamide (Invitrogen), 2.9 X SSC pH 7.0 (Sigma)) was added and gently mixed. The hybridization solution was then incubated at 73Â°C for 10 min to denature the DNA and subsequently at 37Â°C for 60 min to allow the Cot-1 DNA to block repetitive sequences. Hybridization and washing was done automatically using a GeneTAC/HybArray12 hybstation (Genomic Solutions / Perkin Elmer). Hybridization was for 38 h at 37Â°C. Subsequently slides were washed 6 cycles (flow for 10 s, hold for 20 s) with 50% (v/v) formamide, 2X SSC, 2 cycles with phosphate-buffer (0.1 M Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 0.1% (v/v) Igepal CA630 (Sigma)), 2 cycles with 0.2 X SSC (Sigma) and 2 cycles with 0.1 X SSC. Slides were then taken out of the hybstation and briefly rinsed in 0.01 X SSC, dried by centrifugation for 3 min at 1000 g and scanned using a Microarray Scanner G2565AB (Agilent Technologies).!Sample_data_processing = Spot analysis and quality control was fully automated using BlueFuse version 3.4 (BlueGnome, Cambridge, UK). Spots were excluded when the quality flag was less than 1, the Confidence value less than 0.3 when stdev was larger than 0.2 or when no chromosomal mapping information was available. Log2ratioâs of spots that were not excluded after quality flagging and mapping were normalized to their median value.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE12951!Sample_data_row_count = 19200#ID_REF = #CONFIDENCE = The Confidence Estimate in the calculated ratio, between 0 and 1, calculated by BlueFuse#AMPCH1 = Total signal in channel 1 (Cy3)#AMPCH2 = Total signal in channel 2 (Cy5)#LOG2RATIO CH1/CH2 = Log, base 2, of the ratio of total signal in channel 1 divided by total signal in channel 2#QUALITY = A flag to highlight spots that suffer from poor printing and other experimental artefacts (1 acceptable; 0 not acceptable), estimated by BlueFuse#VALUE = Median normalized value of the log2ratio, replicates are fused by BlueFuse, features with confidence < 0.1 or stdev > 0.2 quality 0 are excluded!sample_table_beginID_REF	CONFIDENCE	AMPCH1	AMPCH2	LOG2RATIO CH1/CH2	QUALITY	VALUE1	0.38	261.002	2691.819	-3.366	0	2	0.38	292.211	2848.812	-3.285	0	3	0.39	270.77	2541.308	-3.23	0	4	0.01	49.479	179.219	-1.857	0	5	0.02	67.905	422.895	-2.639	0	6	0.02	83.494	338.1	-2.018	0	7	0.87	1312.637	13726.91	-3.386	1	0.2238	0.88	1224.764	12939.306	-3.401	1	0.2239	0.89	1199.035	12566.099	-3.39	1	0.22310	0.03	64.262	454.739	-2.823	0	11	0.06	66.946	401.34	-2.584	1	12	0.04	65.848	489.116	-2.893	0	13	0.88	952.231	12371.273	-3.7	1	-0.07314	0.89	914.594	11799.14	-3.689	1	-0.07315	0.89	929.496	11869.7	-3.675	1	-0.07316	0.13	129.143	693.091	-2.424	0	17	0.11	109.901	760.669	-2.791	0	18	0.15	105.009	684.98	-2.706	1	19	0.88	1559.76	18391.225	-3.56	1	0.06520	0.89	1552.8	18236.859	-3.554	1	0.065!sample_table_end
