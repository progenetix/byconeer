The fluorescence intensity and ratio data for Cy5 and Cy3 were initially analyzed using GenePix 4.3 software. Raw data were retrieved in BRB-ArrayTools format for analysis and normalization(http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRBArrayTools.html).. Following filter criteria was applied to the data set: 1. spots were excluded if intensity < 100, and spot size less than 25Âµm 2. genes were filtered out if >50% of experiment with missing data values. 3. log2 transformed data were normalized using lowess smoother, and intensity ratios were truncated if greater than 64 Further data preprocessing was done using webtool preP (http://prep.bioinfo.cnio.es/). Missing data were imputed using KNN imputation method with K=15. Gene location was extracted according to UniGene Cluster IDs from Ensemble and UCSC using IDconverter (http://idconverter.bioinfor.cnio.es/).The pre-processed aCGH data was then segmented using the circular binary segmentation method implemented in ADaCGH (http://adacgh.bioinfo.cnio.es/) to detect regions with abnormal DNA copy number. The smooth parameters were set as defaults.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3895!Sample_contact_name = Francesco,Maria,Marincola!Sample_contact_email = fmarincola@sidra.org!Sample_contact_phone = 301-793-8210!Sample_contact_institute = Sidra Medical and Research Center!Sample_contact_address = Al Nasr Tower, AL Corniche Street, PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_city = Doha!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_country = Qatar!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM218nnn/GSM218059/suppl/GSM218059.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8777!Sample_data_row_count = 16834#ID_REF = NCI mAdb well id plus replicate number#VALUE = log2 of the Calibrated Ratio (Cy5 channel/Cy3 channel)#Slide_block = Array block location#Slide_column = Array column location#Slide_row = Array row location#CY5_mean = Red Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY5_SD = Red Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY5_BKD_median = Red Channel Sample median Background Level#CY5_BKD_SD = Red Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#CY3_mean = Green Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY3_SD = Green Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY3_BKD_median = Green Channel Sample median Background Level#CY3_BKD_SD = Green Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#Flag = Quality flag 0->good, -50->Not found, -100->Bad!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Slide_block	Slide_column	Slide_row	CY5_mean	CY5_SD	CY5_BKD_median	CY5_BKD_SD	CY3_mean	CY3_SD	CY3_BKD_median	CY3_BKD_SD	Flag184053_1	-0.055555556	1	1	1	2756	762	368	516	2324	592	337	393	0184821_1	-0.272696257	1	1	2	2772	737	589	512	2507	719	492	400	0185589_1	-0.248658299	1	1	3	1568	762	395	324	1465	658	352	267	0186357_1	-0.037893202	1	1	4	2941	858	358	278	2444	790	327	222	0187125_1	-0.070904113	1	1	5	2922	1256	337	227	2453	1096	302	187	0187893_1	-0.140406132	1	1	6	2918	1389	315	155	2552	1098	290	138	0188661_1	0.099479027	1	1	7	1415	566	314	158	1196	484	293	123	0189429_1	0.001581039	1	1	8	2214	826	322	172	1859	739	306	128	0190197_1	0.060851969	1	1	9	1520	364	339	282	1304	297	319	216	0190965_1	0.034002334	1	1	10	1742	783	324	436	1457	610	295	343	0273540_1	NULL	1	1	11	3056	2374	299	703	2503	1904	269	538	0274308_1	0.006081058	1	1	12	1153	653	294	487	1006	518	264	373	0275076_1	0.125976652	1	1	13	2254	943	286	169	1776	769	276	149	0275844_1	0.156740874	1	1	14	1328	342	294	128	1077	264	261	122	0276612_1	0.386105627	1	1	15	1339	707	300	122	1016	530	270	100	0277380_1	0.210949898	1	1	16	1050	287	332	237	860	274	287	197	0278148_1	0.3783319	1	1	17	2071	1158	311	502	1454	875	279	376	0278916_1	NULL	1	1	18	468	356	308	311	449	268	279	227	0279684_1	0.676675379	1	1	19	1177	795	281	370	887	574	279	249	0280452_1	NULL	1	1	20	328	182	269	547	347	126	304	426	0!sample_table_end
