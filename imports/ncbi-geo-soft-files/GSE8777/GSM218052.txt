The fluorescence intensity and ratio data for Cy5 and Cy3 were initially analyzed using GenePix 4.3 software. Raw data were retrieved in BRB-ArrayTools format for analysis and normalization(http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRBArrayTools.html).. Following filter criteria was applied to the data set: 1. spots were excluded if intensity < 100, and spot size less than 25Âµm 2. genes were filtered out if >50% of experiment with missing data values. 3. log2 transformed data were normalized using lowess smoother, and intensity ratios were truncated if greater than 64 Further data preprocessing was done using webtool preP (http://prep.bioinfo.cnio.es/). Missing data were imputed using KNN imputation method with K=15. Gene location was extracted according to UniGene Cluster IDs from Ensemble and UCSC using IDconverter (http://idconverter.bioinfor.cnio.es/).The pre-processed aCGH data was then segmented using the circular binary segmentation method implemented in ADaCGH (http://adacgh.bioinfo.cnio.es/) to detect regions with abnormal DNA copy number. The smooth parameters were set as defaults.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3895!Sample_contact_name = Francesco,Maria,Marincola!Sample_contact_email = fmarincola@sidra.org!Sample_contact_phone = 301-793-8210!Sample_contact_institute = Sidra Medical and Research Center!Sample_contact_address = Al Nasr Tower, AL Corniche Street, PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_city = Doha!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_country = Qatar!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM218nnn/GSM218052/suppl/GSM218052.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8777!Sample_data_row_count = 16834#ID_REF = NCI mAdb well id plus replicate number#VALUE = log2 of the Calibrated Ratio (Cy5 channel/Cy3 channel)#Slide_block = Array block location#Slide_column = Array column location#Slide_row = Array row location#CY5_mean = Red Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY5_SD = Red Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY5_BKD_median = Red Channel Sample median Background Level#CY5_BKD_SD = Red Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#CY3_mean = Green Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY3_SD = Green Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY3_BKD_median = Green Channel Sample median Background Level#CY3_BKD_SD = Green Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#Flag = Quality flag 0->good, -50->Not found, -100->Bad!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Slide_block	Slide_column	Slide_row	CY5_mean	CY5_SD	CY5_BKD_median	CY5_BKD_SD	CY3_mean	CY3_SD	CY3_BKD_median	CY3_BKD_SD	Flag184053_1	-0.116933897	1	1	1	7270	4735	1531	677	7834	4364	1675	587	0184821_1	0.014711581	1	1	2	7191	2210	1590	578	7232	2116	1697	470	0185589_1	0.127426639	1	1	3	8306	1867	1562	934	8102	1734	1672	520	0186357_1	-0.204619423	1	1	4	5951	2442	1504	985	6337	2368	1617	688	0187125_1	0.321364999	1	1	5	11113	2511	1633	1033	10048	2442	1673	981	0187893_1	0.078334868	1	1	6	9319	3430	1599	929	9456	3465	1724	839	0188661_1	0.094698578	1	1	7	7630	2367	1631	1100	7589	2179	1797	555	0189429_1	-0.227181971	1	1	8	8140	3734	1675	1402	9287	4015	1811	813	0190197_1	-0.065465838	1	1	9	6534	3133	1648	852	6689	2863	1775	871	0190965_1	0.254309356	1	1	10	12889	2713	1623	619	12350	2432	1732	595	0273540_1	NULL	1	1	11	38111	10531	1550	609	35635	8789	1724	513	0274308_1	0.223885074	1	1	12	8821	2303	1528	592	8410	2144	1699	483	0275076_1	0.025110325	1	1	13	9340	2863	1544	635	9950	2910	1767	496	0275844_1	-0.302238822	1	1	14	6098	1709	1524	755	7090	1957	1793	767	0276612_1	-0.21312812	1	1	15	5794	2061	1594	696	6242	2002	1783	759	0277380_1	0.283615112	1	1	16	7042	2210	1659	1365	6440	1552	1796	1290	0278148_1	-0.047623839	1	1	17	6253	1919	1666	1261	6401	1832	1842	1209	0278916_1	-0.196900353	1	1	18	6043	1815	1710	848	6670	1964	2003	862	0279684_1	0.109704971	1	1	19	8609	3044	1677	850	8961	2996	2030	828	0280452_1	0.1987077	1	1	20	7608	3028	1683	1347	7510	2676	1971	1396	0!sample_table_end
