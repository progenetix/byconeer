The fluorescence intensity and ratio data for Cy5 and Cy3 were initially analyzed using GenePix 4.3 software. Raw data were retrieved in BRB-ArrayTools format for analysis and normalization(http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRBArrayTools.html).. Following filter criteria was applied to the data set: 1. spots were excluded if intensity < 100, and spot size less than 25Âµm 2. genes were filtered out if >50% of experiment with missing data values. 3. log2 transformed data were normalized using lowess smoother, and intensity ratios were truncated if greater than 64 Further data preprocessing was done using webtool preP (http://prep.bioinfo.cnio.es/). Missing data were imputed using KNN imputation method with K=15. Gene location was extracted according to UniGene Cluster IDs from Ensemble and UCSC using IDconverter (http://idconverter.bioinfor.cnio.es/).The pre-processed aCGH data was then segmented using the circular binary segmentation method implemented in ADaCGH (http://adacgh.bioinfo.cnio.es/) to detect regions with abnormal DNA copy number. The smooth parameters were set as defaults.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3895!Sample_contact_name = Francesco,Maria,Marincola!Sample_contact_email = fmarincola@sidra.org!Sample_contact_phone = 301-793-8210!Sample_contact_institute = Sidra Medical and Research Center!Sample_contact_address = Al Nasr Tower, AL Corniche Street, PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_city = Doha!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_country = Qatar!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM218nnn/GSM218049/suppl/GSM218049.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8777!Sample_data_row_count = 16834#ID_REF = NCI mAdb well id plus replicate number#VALUE = log2 of the Calibrated Ratio (Cy5 channel/Cy3 channel)#Slide_block = Array block location#Slide_column = Array column location#Slide_row = Array row location#CY5_mean = Red Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY5_SD = Red Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY5_BKD_median = Red Channel Sample median Background Level#CY5_BKD_SD = Red Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#CY3_mean = Green Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY3_SD = Green Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY3_BKD_median = Green Channel Sample median Background Level#CY3_BKD_SD = Green Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#Flag = Quality flag 0->good, -50->Not found, -100->Bad!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Slide_block	Slide_column	Slide_row	CY5_mean	CY5_SD	CY5_BKD_median	CY5_BKD_SD	CY3_mean	CY3_SD	CY3_BKD_median	CY3_BKD_SD	Flag184053_1	-0.479749858	1	1	1	4327	1420	1225	764	4882	1373	1394	774	0184821_1	-0.172821671	1	1	2	5659	2017	2044	876	6059	1903	2412	792	0185589_1	NULL	1	1	3	2593	695	1329	790	2740	572	1497	740	0186357_1	-0.173121437	1	1	4	4120	1316	1156	545	4135	1175	1303	546	0187125_1	0.050509173	1	1	5	5302	1518	1048	480	5115	1335	1162	433	0187893_1	-0.053341676	1	1	6	6173	2814	935	417	6419	3008	1081	376	0188661_1	-0.64345783	1	1	7	2649	708	914	368	2716	568	1005	314	0189429_1	-0.11620985	1	1	8	5155	2090	965	1166	5371	2221	1083	554	0190197_1	-0.562981129	1	1	9	2848	1160	957	1218	2999	1210	1103	547	0190965_1	0.705622315	1	1	10	6552	2238	989	842	4831	1287	1111	416	0273540_1	NULL	1	1	11	19336	5651	1105	1202	18801	5694	1194	553	0274308_1	-0.263726234	1	1	12	3700	1021	1182	1236	3417	816	1188	578	0275076_1	-0.245603934	1	1	13	3695	1330	1024	953	3597	1136	1091	443	0275844_1	-0.047557421	1	1	14	2550	553	957	556	2455	490	1079	305	0276612_1	-0.257753849	1	1	15	3109	1159	928	387	3135	1036	1098	290	0277380_1	0.199735478	1	1	16	2826	677	964	415	2582	501	1093	312	0278148_1	-0.003124465	1	1	17	9798	2567	1117	439	9374	2189	1068	335	0278916_1	-0.39944157	1	1	18	3104	669	1096	445	2786	545	1059	369	0279684_1	0.21808511	1	1	19	5416	1305	1073	497	4719	1128	1106	349	0280452_1	1.312493324	1	1	20	4804	1350	1119	498	2835	731	1062	358	0!sample_table_end
