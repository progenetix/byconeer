The fluorescence intensity and ratio data for Cy5 and Cy3 were initially analyzed using GenePix 4.3 software. Raw data were retrieved in BRB-ArrayTools format for analysis and normalization(http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRBArrayTools.html).. Following filter criteria was applied to the data set: 1. spots were excluded if intensity < 100, and spot size less than 25Âµm 2. genes were filtered out if >50% of experiment with missing data values. 3. log2 transformed data were normalized using lowess smoother, and intensity ratios were truncated if greater than 64 Further data preprocessing was done using webtool preP (http://prep.bioinfo.cnio.es/). Missing data were imputed using KNN imputation method with K=15. Gene location was extracted according to UniGene Cluster IDs from Ensemble and UCSC using IDconverter (http://idconverter.bioinfor.cnio.es/).The pre-processed aCGH data was then segmented using the circular binary segmentation method implemented in ADaCGH (http://adacgh.bioinfo.cnio.es/) to detect regions with abnormal DNA copy number. The smooth parameters were set as defaults.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3895!Sample_contact_name = Francesco,Maria,Marincola!Sample_contact_email = fmarincola@sidra.org!Sample_contact_phone = 301-793-8210!Sample_contact_institute = Sidra Medical and Research Center!Sample_contact_address = Al Nasr Tower, AL Corniche Street, PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_city = Doha!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_country = Qatar!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM218nnn/GSM218060/suppl/GSM218060.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8777!Sample_data_row_count = 16834#ID_REF = NCI mAdb well id plus replicate number#VALUE = log2 of the Calibrated Ratio (Cy5 channel/Cy3 channel)#Slide_block = Array block location#Slide_column = Array column location#Slide_row = Array row location#CY5_mean = Red Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY5_SD = Red Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY5_BKD_median = Red Channel Sample median Background Level#CY5_BKD_SD = Red Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#CY3_mean = Green Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY3_SD = Green Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY3_BKD_median = Green Channel Sample median Background Level#CY3_BKD_SD = Green Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#Flag = Quality flag 0->good, -50->Not found, -100->Bad!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Slide_block	Slide_column	Slide_row	CY5_mean	CY5_SD	CY5_BKD_median	CY5_BKD_SD	CY3_mean	CY3_SD	CY3_BKD_median	CY3_BKD_SD	Flag184053_1	-0.214898691	1	1	1	2242	472	343	264	2013	422	359	217	0184821_1	-0.331389248	1	1	2	1474	582	443	319	1415	563	431	286	0185589_1	NULL	1	1	3	784	249	388	256	832	224	388	227	0186357_1	-0.37924993	1	1	4	1913	864	335	154	1866	708	351	128	0187125_1	-0.07764525	1	1	5	2488	724	301	121	2058	691	317	112	0187893_1	-0.330485106	1	1	6	2219	852	287	115	2115	787	317	106	0188661_1	NULL	1	1	7	723	211	344	163	749	177	354	136	0189429_1	-0.217500776	1	1	8	1447	637	407	213	1351	517	401	180	0190197_1	-0.700763583	1	1	9	804	264	394	260	981	247	411	251	0190965_1	-0.104279883	1	1	10	782	320	376	276	896	412	396	307	0273540_1	NULL	1	1	11	5237	1592	320	203	3966	1280	349	219	0274308_1	-0.678890765	1	1	12	816	287	288	95	944	296	320	90	0275076_1	-0.449166685	1	1	13	887	364	289	125	978	387	325	131	0275844_1	-0.814259171	1	1	14	563	186	283	117	808	208	329	134	0276612_1	-0.089120314	1	1	15	866	310	306	141	919	301	351	160	0277380_1	-0.066752359	1	1	16	916	250	294	123	905	230	318	121	0278148_1	0.176403716	1	1	17	1437	466	269	102	1201	401	308	94	0278916_1	0.064038128	1	1	18	655	326	271	104	689	376	314	122	0279684_1	0.160042599	1	1	19	1482	346	278	133	1244	313	318	121	0280452_1	NULL	1	1	20	559	325	307	262	582	268	327	214	0!sample_table_end
