The fluorescence intensity and ratio data for Cy5 and Cy3 were initially analyzed using GenePix 4.3 software. Raw data were retrieved in BRB-ArrayTools format for analysis and normalization(http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRBArrayTools.html).. Following filter criteria was applied to the data set: 1. spots were excluded if intensity < 100, and spot size less than 25Âµm 2. genes were filtered out if >50% of experiment with missing data values. 3. log2 transformed data were normalized using lowess smoother, and intensity ratios were truncated if greater than 64 Further data preprocessing was done using webtool preP (http://prep.bioinfo.cnio.es/). Missing data were imputed using KNN imputation method with K=15. Gene location was extracted according to UniGene Cluster IDs from Ensemble and UCSC using IDconverter (http://idconverter.bioinfor.cnio.es/).The pre-processed aCGH data was then segmented using the circular binary segmentation method implemented in ADaCGH (http://adacgh.bioinfo.cnio.es/) to detect regions with abnormal DNA copy number. The smooth parameters were set as defaults.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3895!Sample_contact_name = Francesco,Maria,Marincola!Sample_contact_email = fmarincola@sidra.org!Sample_contact_phone = 301-793-8210!Sample_contact_institute = Sidra Medical and Research Center!Sample_contact_address = Al Nasr Tower, AL Corniche Street, PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_city = Doha!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_country = Qatar!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM218nnn/GSM218058/suppl/GSM218058.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8777!Sample_data_row_count = 16834#ID_REF = NCI mAdb well id plus replicate number#VALUE = log2 of the Calibrated Ratio (Cy5 channel/Cy3 channel)#Slide_block = Array block location#Slide_column = Array column location#Slide_row = Array row location#CY5_mean = Red Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY5_SD = Red Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY5_BKD_median = Red Channel Sample median Background Level#CY5_BKD_SD = Red Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#CY3_mean = Green Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY3_SD = Green Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY3_BKD_median = Green Channel Sample median Background Level#CY3_BKD_SD = Green Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#Flag = Quality flag 0->good, -50->Not found, -100->Bad!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Slide_block	Slide_column	Slide_row	CY5_mean	CY5_SD	CY5_BKD_median	CY5_BKD_SD	CY3_mean	CY3_SD	CY3_BKD_median	CY3_BKD_SD	Flag184053_1	0.041839849	1	1	1	12322	3461	1750	660	10700	3350	1652	644	0184821_1	-0.142964005	1	1	2	9389	3275	1722	660	9007	3444	1667	638	0185589_1	-0.516727388	1	1	3	6001	1980	1600	508	6540	2079	1542	463	0186357_1	-0.281654477	1	1	4	8605	4255	1562	517	8848	4091	1545	484	0187125_1	0.124161184	1	1	5	17146	2819	1513	528	14202	3267	1570	506	0187893_1	-0.12721543	1	1	6	16821	4505	1523	497	15965	4263	1564	450	0188661_1	0.084755063	1	1	7	7127	3759	1620	506	6310	3694	1573	431	0189429_1	-0.261156678	1	1	8	10138	3723	1634	483	10385	3471	1637	451	0190197_1	-0.150450617	1	1	9	5427	2291	1574	461	5308	2624	1570	423	0190965_1	-0.347065091	1	1	10	8696	2383	1553	458	9297	2219	1576	392	0273540_1	NULL	1	1	11	38915	5832	1479	439	34864	5870	1570	416	0274308_1	-0.208129928	1	1	12	6352	1640	1512	516	6497	1551	1590	504	0275076_1	-0.113446131	1	1	13	7161	1492	1544	509	7138	1308	1664	476	0275844_1	0.061187457	1	1	14	8631	3125	1534	460	7856	2558	1623	437	0276612_1	0.127363861	1	1	15	7040	1937	1528	568	6335	1917	1593	526	0277380_1	0.648448586	1	1	16	8194	2003	1561	529	6012	1480	1608	496	0278148_1	-0.078296602	1	1	17	10053	2216	1546	506	9456	1810	1553	459	0278916_1	-0.092840448	1	1	18	12460	3009	1496	614	11842	2667	1572	532	0279684_1	0.160012752	1	1	19	12108	1933	1511	496	10207	2150	1594	438	0280452_1	0.182101279	1	1	20	15225	3472	1645	604	12266	3131	1619	502	0!sample_table_end
