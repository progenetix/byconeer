The fluorescence intensity and ratio data for Cy5 and Cy3 were initially analyzed using GenePix 4.3 software. Raw data were retrieved in BRB-ArrayTools format for analysis and normalization(http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRBArrayTools.html).. Following filter criteria was applied to the data set: 1. spots were excluded if intensity < 100, and spot size less than 25Âµm 2. genes were filtered out if >50% of experiment with missing data values. 3. log2 transformed data were normalized using lowess smoother, and intensity ratios were truncated if greater than 64 Further data preprocessing was done using webtool preP (http://prep.bioinfo.cnio.es/). Missing data were imputed using KNN imputation method with K=15. Gene location was extracted according to UniGene Cluster IDs from Ensemble and UCSC using IDconverter (http://idconverter.bioinfor.cnio.es/).The pre-processed aCGH data was then segmented using the circular binary segmentation method implemented in ADaCGH (http://adacgh.bioinfo.cnio.es/) to detect regions with abnormal DNA copy number. The smooth parameters were set as defaults.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3895!Sample_contact_name = Francesco,Maria,Marincola!Sample_contact_email = fmarincola@sidra.org!Sample_contact_phone = 301-793-8210!Sample_contact_institute = Sidra Medical and Research Center!Sample_contact_address = Al Nasr Tower, AL Corniche Street, PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_city = Doha!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_country = Qatar!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM218nnn/GSM218046/suppl/GSM218046.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8777!Sample_data_row_count = 16834#ID_REF = NCI mAdb well id plus replicate number#VALUE = log2 of the Calibrated Ratio (Cy5 channel/Cy3 channel)#Slide_block = Array block location#Slide_column = Array column location#Slide_row = Array row location#CY5_mean = Red Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY5_SD = Red Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY5_BKD_median = Red Channel Sample median Background Level#CY5_BKD_SD = Red Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#CY3_mean = Green Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY3_SD = Green Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY3_BKD_median = Green Channel Sample median Background Level#CY3_BKD_SD = Green Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#Flag = Quality flag 0->good, -50->Not found, -100->Bad!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Slide_block	Slide_column	Slide_row	CY5_mean	CY5_SD	CY5_BKD_median	CY5_BKD_SD	CY3_mean	CY3_SD	CY3_BKD_median	CY3_BKD_SD	Flag184053_1	-0.212305248	1	1	1	3829	2244	748	318	3504	1767	689	174	0184821_1	-0.238411978	1	1	2	3113	1044	688	311	2912	807	668	174	0185589_1	0.130173936	1	1	3	3693	897	716	307	2957	579	675	185	0186357_1	-0.254477113	1	1	4	3301	1278	710	313	3130	897	696	183	0187125_1	-0.118658602	1	1	5	4218	1277	681	321	3850	1182	691	186	0187893_1	-0.470593065	1	1	6	4429	1466	672	349	4885	1487	726	201	0188661_1	-0.292089075	1	1	7	2140	917	676	310	2059	633	664	191	0189429_1	-0.511525512	1	1	8	3040	755	668	299	3174	622	647	173	0190197_1	-0.162550494	1	1	9	1606	734	644	298	1552	559	656	173	0190965_1	-0.225476235	1	1	10	3635	1172	645	290	3486	728	664	183	0273540_1	NULL	1	1	11	10814	3685	620	361	10388	2727	676	271	0274308_1	-0.248220339	1	1	12	2483	797	603	308	2450	482	656	204	0275076_1	-0.277265787	1	1	13	3008	1020	589	280	3001	870	643	181	0275844_1	-0.5112921	1	1	14	3603	1417	590	282	4026	1172	641	186	0276612_1	-0.410028487	1	1	15	2563	691	575	282	2658	493	617	186	0277380_1	0.051400822	1	1	16	2436	684	550	273	2256	479	645	177	0278148_1	-0.436290115	1	1	17	3009	1040	592	278	3244	818	663	179	0278916_1	-1.154932022	1	1	18	2025	608	582	303	2772	644	668	184	0279684_1	-0.43277064	1	1	19	2308	796	587	295	2463	646	658	201	0280452_1	-0.384725779	1	1	20	2104	697	598	271	2187	575	648	198	0!sample_table_end
