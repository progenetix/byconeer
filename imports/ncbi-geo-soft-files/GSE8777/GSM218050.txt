The fluorescence intensity and ratio data for Cy5 and Cy3 were initially analyzed using GenePix 4.3 software. Raw data were retrieved in BRB-ArrayTools format for analysis and normalization(http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRBArrayTools.html).. Following filter criteria was applied to the data set: 1. spots were excluded if intensity < 100, and spot size less than 25Âµm 2. genes were filtered out if >50% of experiment with missing data values. 3. log2 transformed data were normalized using lowess smoother, and intensity ratios were truncated if greater than 64 Further data preprocessing was done using webtool preP (http://prep.bioinfo.cnio.es/). Missing data were imputed using KNN imputation method with K=15. Gene location was extracted according to UniGene Cluster IDs from Ensemble and UCSC using IDconverter (http://idconverter.bioinfor.cnio.es/).The pre-processed aCGH data was then segmented using the circular binary segmentation method implemented in ADaCGH (http://adacgh.bioinfo.cnio.es/) to detect regions with abnormal DNA copy number. The smooth parameters were set as defaults.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3895!Sample_contact_name = Francesco,Maria,Marincola!Sample_contact_email = fmarincola@sidra.org!Sample_contact_phone = 301-793-8210!Sample_contact_institute = Sidra Medical and Research Center!Sample_contact_address = Al Nasr Tower, AL Corniche Street, PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_city = Doha!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_country = Qatar!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM218nnn/GSM218050/suppl/GSM218050.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8777!Sample_data_row_count = 16834#ID_REF = NCI mAdb well id plus replicate number#VALUE = log2 of the Calibrated Ratio (Cy5 channel/Cy3 channel)#Slide_block = Array block location#Slide_column = Array column location#Slide_row = Array row location#CY5_mean = Red Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY5_SD = Red Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY5_BKD_median = Red Channel Sample median Background Level#CY5_BKD_SD = Red Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#CY3_mean = Green Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY3_SD = Green Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY3_BKD_median = Green Channel Sample median Background Level#CY3_BKD_SD = Green Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#Flag = Quality flag 0->good, -50->Not found, -100->Bad!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Slide_block	Slide_column	Slide_row	CY5_mean	CY5_SD	CY5_BKD_median	CY5_BKD_SD	CY3_mean	CY3_SD	CY3_BKD_median	CY3_BKD_SD	Flag184053_1	-0.709792316	1	1	1	4133	1895	1710	569	4843	2586	1545	479	0184821_1	NULL	1	1	2	2777	723	1689	490	2832	635	1548	417	0185589_1	-0.155690104	1	1	3	3556	739	1624	464	3568	699	1493	389	0186357_1	-0.258906215	1	1	4	3683	2122	1604	465	3704	2389	1388	367	0187125_1	0.320964098	1	1	5	4977	1203	1589	484	4779	1188	1390	406	0187893_1	-0.24180916	1	1	6	3472	1128	1549	500	3642	1358	1452	428	0188661_1	-0.062774546	1	1	7	3343	991	1547	482	3465	1040	1464	374	0189429_1	-0.123769961	1	1	8	4837	1136	1595	488	5402	1133	1465	404	0190197_1	NULL	1	1	9	2697	704	1606	481	3053	691	1485	462	0190965_1	-0.135996953	1	1	10	5954	1172	1575	486	6955	1347	1483	441	0273540_1	NULL	1	1	11	34931	8943	1582	474	39711	10231	1461	392	0274308_1	-0.096654221	1	1	12	3883	968	1581	476	4181	946	1491	381	0275076_1	0.023752844	1	1	13	5168	1920	1559	485	5774	2225	1524	431	0275844_1	0.176148996	1	1	14	4655	1235	1496	470	5036	1329	1493	454	0276612_1	0.764590919	1	1	15	3813	851	1494	474	3633	803	1429	421	0277380_1	0.313811213	1	1	16	4448	1329	1513	492	4502	1222	1433	409	0278148_1	0.012501037	1	1	17	7404	2487	1556	560	8262	2863	1471	644	0278916_1	-0.299526721	1	1	18	3996	1010	1531	502	4559	1029	1433	467	0279684_1	0.341040313	1	1	19	4756	1530	1463	500	4909	1398	1453	441	0280452_1	0.324756116	1	1	20	4337	1043	1530	519	4486	1071	1503	450	0!sample_table_end
