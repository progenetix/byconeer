The fluorescence intensity and ratio data for Cy5 and Cy3 were initially analyzed using GenePix 4.3 software. Raw data were retrieved in BRB-ArrayTools format for analysis and normalization(http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRBArrayTools.html).. Following filter criteria was applied to the data set: 1. spots were excluded if intensity < 100, and spot size less than 25Âµm 2. genes were filtered out if >50% of experiment with missing data values. 3. log2 transformed data were normalized using lowess smoother, and intensity ratios were truncated if greater than 64 Further data preprocessing was done using webtool preP (http://prep.bioinfo.cnio.es/). Missing data were imputed using KNN imputation method with K=15. Gene location was extracted according to UniGene Cluster IDs from Ensemble and UCSC using IDconverter (http://idconverter.bioinfor.cnio.es/).The pre-processed aCGH data was then segmented using the circular binary segmentation method implemented in ADaCGH (http://adacgh.bioinfo.cnio.es/) to detect regions with abnormal DNA copy number. The smooth parameters were set as defaults.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3895!Sample_contact_name = Francesco,Maria,Marincola!Sample_contact_email = fmarincola@sidra.org!Sample_contact_phone = 301-793-8210!Sample_contact_institute = Sidra Medical and Research Center!Sample_contact_address = Al Nasr Tower, AL Corniche Street, PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_city = Doha!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_country = Qatar!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM218nnn/GSM218056/suppl/GSM218056.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8777!Sample_data_row_count = 16834#ID_REF = NCI mAdb well id plus replicate number#VALUE = log2 of the Calibrated Ratio (Cy5 channel/Cy3 channel)#Slide_block = Array block location#Slide_column = Array column location#Slide_row = Array row location#CY5_mean = Red Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY5_SD = Red Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY5_BKD_median = Red Channel Sample median Background Level#CY5_BKD_SD = Red Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#CY3_mean = Green Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY3_SD = Green Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY3_BKD_median = Green Channel Sample median Background Level#CY3_BKD_SD = Green Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#Flag = Quality flag 0->good, -50->Not found, -100->Bad!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Slide_block	Slide_column	Slide_row	CY5_mean	CY5_SD	CY5_BKD_median	CY5_BKD_SD	CY3_mean	CY3_SD	CY3_BKD_median	CY3_BKD_SD	Flag184053_1	-0.220477164	1	1	1	9069	2493	3024	2134	8274	2177	2607	1995	0184821_1	0.504838526	1	1	2	8812	2139	4065	1568	7732	1897	3868	1389	0185589_1	0.181637123	1	1	3	5584	1683	2038	1173	4645	1768	1850	923	0186357_1	-0.168985903	1	1	4	6291	1681	1880	962	5929	1491	1764	732	0187125_1	0.396144211	1	1	5	9312	2504	1787	711	7227	2169	1616	506	0187893_1	0.05003728	1	1	6	8904	3350	1717	1173	8052	2768	1585	723	0188661_1	-0.026495021	1	1	7	5232	1734	1905	807	4470	1289	1718	635	0189429_1	-0.460836887	1	1	8	7772	3021	2046	786	8276	2377	1856	637	0190197_1	-0.134141743	1	1	9	5913	1903	1833	676	5405	1384	1691	554	0190965_1	-0.095061705	1	1	10	6726	1789	1565	715	6296	1558	1447	497	0273540_1	NULL	1	1	11	32779	6283	1442	756	26908	4805	1354	547	0274308_1	0.135465831	1	1	12	4851	1283	1431	639	4053	944	1322	482	0275076_1	-0.422198802	1	1	13	4377	1660	1399	609	4274	1480	1322	449	0275844_1	0.037148625	1	1	14	4223	1105	1423	598	3587	702	1323	371	0276612_1	0.182163179	1	1	15	4746	1700	1410	559	3966	1253	1331	372	0277380_1	0.33016479	1	1	16	4441	990	1387	544	3522	800	1282	370	0278148_1	-0.077436507	1	1	17	5559	1288	1384	568	5090	983	1288	368	0278916_1	-0.103883408	1	1	18	4448	1036	1527	605	3906	782	1417	399	0279684_1	0.008304002	1	1	19	6327	1357	1472	601	5736	1013	1399	400	0280452_1	0.383756757	1	1	20	5233	1421	1411	674	4187	921	1355	496	0!sample_table_end
