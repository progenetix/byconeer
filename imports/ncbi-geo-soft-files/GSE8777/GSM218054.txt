The fluorescence intensity and ratio data for Cy5 and Cy3 were initially analyzed using GenePix 4.3 software. Raw data were retrieved in BRB-ArrayTools format for analysis and normalization(http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRBArrayTools.html).. Following filter criteria was applied to the data set: 1. spots were excluded if intensity < 100, and spot size less than 25Âµm 2. genes were filtered out if >50% of experiment with missing data values. 3. log2 transformed data were normalized using lowess smoother, and intensity ratios were truncated if greater than 64 Further data preprocessing was done using webtool preP (http://prep.bioinfo.cnio.es/). Missing data were imputed using KNN imputation method with K=15. Gene location was extracted according to UniGene Cluster IDs from Ensemble and UCSC using IDconverter (http://idconverter.bioinfor.cnio.es/).The pre-processed aCGH data was then segmented using the circular binary segmentation method implemented in ADaCGH (http://adacgh.bioinfo.cnio.es/) to detect regions with abnormal DNA copy number. The smooth parameters were set as defaults.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3895!Sample_contact_name = Francesco,Maria,Marincola!Sample_contact_email = fmarincola@sidra.org!Sample_contact_phone = 301-793-8210!Sample_contact_institute = Sidra Medical and Research Center!Sample_contact_address = Al Nasr Tower, AL Corniche Street, PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_city = Doha!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_country = Qatar!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM218nnn/GSM218054/suppl/GSM218054.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8777!Sample_data_row_count = 16834#ID_REF = NCI mAdb well id plus replicate number#VALUE = log2 of the Calibrated Ratio (Cy5 channel/Cy3 channel)#Slide_block = Array block location#Slide_column = Array column location#Slide_row = Array row location#CY5_mean = Red Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY5_SD = Red Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY5_BKD_median = Red Channel Sample median Background Level#CY5_BKD_SD = Red Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#CY3_mean = Green Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY3_SD = Green Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY3_BKD_median = Green Channel Sample median Background Level#CY3_BKD_SD = Green Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#Flag = Quality flag 0->good, -50->Not found, -100->Bad!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Slide_block	Slide_column	Slide_row	CY5_mean	CY5_SD	CY5_BKD_median	CY5_BKD_SD	CY3_mean	CY3_SD	CY3_BKD_median	CY3_BKD_SD	Flag184053_1	0.133661255	1	1	1	12933	3381	3754	2295	10907	2007	3411	2084	0184821_1	0.455118001	1	1	2	10747	2733	4231	2295	8938	1951	3807	1910	0185589_1	-0.075543232	1	1	3	8176	2190	3230	1903	6881	1674	2729	1534	0186357_1	-0.149402589	1	1	4	8817	2893	2714	1138	7745	2291	2332	784	0187125_1	0.482972294	1	1	5	11729	4764	2558	763	8271	3252	2177	528	0187893_1	-0.083897248	1	1	6	11677	3586	2608	896	10160	3329	2234	662	0188661_1	0.157925755	1	1	7	7068	1476	2628	949	5881	1016	2303	680	0189429_1	-0.375719845	1	1	8	9914	3571	2833	974	9364	3278	2410	711	0190197_1	-0.603522599	1	1	9	6671	1525	2715	795	6046	1231	2291	567	0190965_1	-0.235788211	1	1	10	8945	2334	2516	757	8100	2312	2156	543	0273540_1	NULL	1	1	11	29557	9293	2516	756	26505	8318	2140	599	0274308_1	0.085708469	1	1	12	7277	1621	2616	783	5919	1069	2193	615	0275076_1	-0.33425954	1	1	13	8547	1946	2605	907	7980	1804	2264	553	0275844_1	0.086624712	1	1	14	5488	1453	2508	837	4754	1195	2229	553	0276612_1	-0.397002399	1	1	15	6892	2329	2677	857	6140	2238	2273	1153	0277380_1	0.52576822	1	1	16	6988	1834	2705	1000	5411	1277	2287	599	0278148_1	-0.162243679	1	1	17	11745	2786	2534	866	10557	2653	2167	531	0278916_1	-1.67544055	1	1	18	5274	1307	2629	1020	4930	1159	2191	868	0279684_1	-0.256236702	1	1	19	7032	1774	2553	796	6151	1514	2156	523	0280452_1	0.949149132	1	1	20	5743	1536	2455	780	4651	1179	2175	579	0!sample_table_end
