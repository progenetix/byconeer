The fluorescence intensity and ratio data for Cy5 and Cy3 were initially analyzed using GenePix 4.3 software. Raw data were retrieved in BRB-ArrayTools format for analysis and normalization(http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRBArrayTools.html).. Following filter criteria was applied to the data set: 1. spots were excluded if intensity < 100, and spot size less than 25Âµm 2. genes were filtered out if >50% of experiment with missing data values. 3. log2 transformed data were normalized using lowess smoother, and intensity ratios were truncated if greater than 64 Further data preprocessing was done using webtool preP (http://prep.bioinfo.cnio.es/). Missing data were imputed using KNN imputation method with K=15. Gene location was extracted according to UniGene Cluster IDs from Ensemble and UCSC using IDconverter (http://idconverter.bioinfor.cnio.es/).The pre-processed aCGH data was then segmented using the circular binary segmentation method implemented in ADaCGH (http://adacgh.bioinfo.cnio.es/) to detect regions with abnormal DNA copy number. The smooth parameters were set as defaults.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3895!Sample_contact_name = Francesco,Maria,Marincola!Sample_contact_email = fmarincola@sidra.org!Sample_contact_phone = 301-793-8210!Sample_contact_institute = Sidra Medical and Research Center!Sample_contact_address = Al Nasr Tower, AL Corniche Street, PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_city = Doha!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_country = Qatar!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM218nnn/GSM218057/suppl/GSM218057.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8777!Sample_data_row_count = 16834#ID_REF = NCI mAdb well id plus replicate number#VALUE = log2 of the Calibrated Ratio (Cy5 channel/Cy3 channel)#Slide_block = Array block location#Slide_column = Array column location#Slide_row = Array row location#CY5_mean = Red Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY5_SD = Red Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY5_BKD_median = Red Channel Sample median Background Level#CY5_BKD_SD = Red Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#CY3_mean = Green Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY3_SD = Green Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY3_BKD_median = Green Channel Sample median Background Level#CY3_BKD_SD = Green Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#Flag = Quality flag 0->good, -50->Not found, -100->Bad!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Slide_block	Slide_column	Slide_row	CY5_mean	CY5_SD	CY5_BKD_median	CY5_BKD_SD	CY3_mean	CY3_SD	CY3_BKD_median	CY3_BKD_SD	Flag184053_1	-0.794770777	1	1	1	7248	2780	2786	1105	7566	2605	2493	829	0184821_1	-0.12694338	1	1	2	8893	2690	3052	1316	8392	2390	2774	1021	0185589_1	0.073665507	1	1	3	6976	1522	2527	865	6106	1398	2274	702	0186357_1	-0.404704213	1	1	4	7038	2284	2569	817	6701	2062	2237	611	0187125_1	0.058774203	1	1	5	11790	2619	2463	813	11207	2365	2256	613	0187893_1	-0.043677557	1	1	6	13734	3372	2421	1170	13742	3407	2194	956	0188661_1	-1.845826626	1	1	7	6067	1742	2860	998	5485	1443	2338	829	0189429_1	-0.295541525	1	1	8	8691	2097	2985	971	8365	2107	2614	809	0190197_1	-1.612637997	1	1	9	5877	1820	2863	948	5454	1630	2463	740	0190965_1	1.531817198	1	1	10	13255	3257	2656	883	7298	2134	2285	659	0273540_1	NULL	1	1	11	19972	4485	2447	779	20705	4475	2153	633	0274308_1	-0.596046507	1	1	12	6727	1992	2363	763	6857	2143	2056	600	0275076_1	-0.906714439	1	1	13	6616	1737	2440	834	7186	1589	2126	629	0275844_1	NULL	1	1	14	4703	1152	2454	848	4544	1058	2219	642	0276612_1	0.173974559	1	1	15	5812	1424	2565	893	5136	873	2373	719	0277380_1	-1.434593558	1	1	16	4960	1144	2567	759	5033	745	2254	578	0278148_1	-0.298300564	1	1	17	7292	1445	2369	733	7271	1437	2176	538	0278916_1	-2.08647275	1	1	18	4802	1241	2340	765	5096	1080	2177	567	0279684_1	-0.306619704	1	1	19	6642	1537	2446	792	6220	1222	2178	584	0280452_1	NULL	1	1	20	2575	1009	2398	745	2248	781	2103	586	-100!sample_table_end
