The fluorescence intensity and ratio data for Cy5 and Cy3 were initially analyzed using GenePix 4.3 software. Raw data were retrieved in BRB-ArrayTools format for analysis and normalization(http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRBArrayTools.html).. Following filter criteria was applied to the data set: 1. spots were excluded if intensity < 100, and spot size less than 25Âµm 2. genes were filtered out if >50% of experiment with missing data values. 3. log2 transformed data were normalized using lowess smoother, and intensity ratios were truncated if greater than 64 Further data preprocessing was done using webtool preP (http://prep.bioinfo.cnio.es/). Missing data were imputed using KNN imputation method with K=15. Gene location was extracted according to UniGene Cluster IDs from Ensemble and UCSC using IDconverter (http://idconverter.bioinfor.cnio.es/).The pre-processed aCGH data was then segmented using the circular binary segmentation method implemented in ADaCGH (http://adacgh.bioinfo.cnio.es/) to detect regions with abnormal DNA copy number. The smooth parameters were set as defaults.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3895!Sample_contact_name = Francesco,Maria,Marincola!Sample_contact_email = fmarincola@sidra.org!Sample_contact_phone = 301-793-8210!Sample_contact_institute = Sidra Medical and Research Center!Sample_contact_address = Al Nasr Tower, AL Corniche Street, PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_city = Doha!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_country = Qatar!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM218nnn/GSM218055/suppl/GSM218055.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8777!Sample_data_row_count = 16834#ID_REF = NCI mAdb well id plus replicate number#VALUE = log2 of the Calibrated Ratio (Cy5 channel/Cy3 channel)#Slide_block = Array block location#Slide_column = Array column location#Slide_row = Array row location#CY5_mean = Red Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY5_SD = Red Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY5_BKD_median = Red Channel Sample median Background Level#CY5_BKD_SD = Red Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#CY3_mean = Green Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY3_SD = Green Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY3_BKD_median = Green Channel Sample median Background Level#CY3_BKD_SD = Green Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#Flag = Quality flag 0->good, -50->Not found, -100->Bad!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Slide_block	Slide_column	Slide_row	CY5_mean	CY5_SD	CY5_BKD_median	CY5_BKD_SD	CY3_mean	CY3_SD	CY3_BKD_median	CY3_BKD_SD	Flag184053_1	-0.348138571	1	1	1	11253	4483	2071	834	12801	4251	2061	743	0184821_1	-0.235667557	1	1	2	9416	4954	2235	880	9844	5003	2242	841	0185589_1	-0.324041605	1	1	3	5962	1412	2059	813	5902	1292	2071	763	0186357_1	-0.38017112	1	1	4	9675	4112	1846	834	11259	4305	1963	928	0187125_1	0.572492003	1	1	5	13024	3144	1849	728	9751	2587	1887	532	0187893_1	-0.329226941	1	1	6	11159	4079	1853	761	12849	4698	1913	594	0188661_1	-0.07978306	1	1	7	6257	1580	1772	656	6110	1144	1869	531	0189429_1	-0.552169383	1	1	8	9040	3231	1774	837	11484	3264	1960	523	0190197_1	-0.505201697	1	1	9	5793	1962	1709	702	6570	2127	1886	523	0190965_1	-0.47396028	1	1	10	8236	1500	1620	677	10066	1628	1813	557	0273540_1	NULL	1	1	11	37725	10754	1697	649	36485	9082	1832	577	0274308_1	-0.334187776	1	1	12	7580	1682	1689	666	8414	1690	1798	545	0275076_1	-0.218638062	1	1	13	8980	4449	1614	714	9810	4751	1783	567	0275844_1	-0.230486155	1	1	14	8889	2489	1711	817	9746	2694	1895	860	0276612_1	-0.038983982	1	1	15	10718	4754	1615	905	11170	4962	1922	897	0277380_1	0.246547967	1	1	16	6825	1793	1667	692	6300	1526	1895	538	0278148_1	-0.083416313	1	1	17	13135	3154	1732	662	13840	3555	1881	607	0278916_1	-0.557461143	1	1	18	6533	1760	1594	730	8097	2485	1853	657	0279684_1	0.133784398	1	1	19	9784	2352	1565	720	9417	2289	1873	614	0280452_1	0.230283141	1	1	20	7031	2197	1549	657	6674	1723	1871	577	0!sample_table_end
