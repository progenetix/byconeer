The fluorescence intensity and ratio data for Cy5 and Cy3 were initially analyzed using GenePix 4.3 software. Raw data were retrieved in BRB-ArrayTools format for analysis and normalization(http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRBArrayTools.html).. Following filter criteria was applied to the data set: 1. spots were excluded if intensity < 100, and spot size less than 25Âµm 2. genes were filtered out if >50% of experiment with missing data values. 3. log2 transformed data were normalized using lowess smoother, and intensity ratios were truncated if greater than 64 Further data preprocessing was done using webtool preP (http://prep.bioinfo.cnio.es/). Missing data were imputed using KNN imputation method with K=15. Gene location was extracted according to UniGene Cluster IDs from Ensemble and UCSC using IDconverter (http://idconverter.bioinfor.cnio.es/).The pre-processed aCGH data was then segmented using the circular binary segmentation method implemented in ADaCGH (http://adacgh.bioinfo.cnio.es/) to detect regions with abnormal DNA copy number. The smooth parameters were set as defaults.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3895!Sample_contact_name = Francesco,Maria,Marincola!Sample_contact_email = fmarincola@sidra.org!Sample_contact_phone = 301-793-8210!Sample_contact_institute = Sidra Medical and Research Center!Sample_contact_address = Al Nasr Tower, AL Corniche Street, PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_city = Doha!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 26999!Sample_contact_country = Qatar!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM218nnn/GSM218053/suppl/GSM218053.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8777!Sample_data_row_count = 16834#ID_REF = NCI mAdb well id plus replicate number#VALUE = log2 of the Calibrated Ratio (Cy5 channel/Cy3 channel)#Slide_block = Array block location#Slide_column = Array column location#Slide_row = Array row location#CY5_mean = Red Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY5_SD = Red Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY5_BKD_median = Red Channel Sample median Background Level#CY5_BKD_SD = Red Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#CY3_mean = Green Channel Sample mean Signal (Background Subtracted)#CY3_SD = Green Channel Sample Standard Deviation#CY3_BKD_median = Green Channel Sample median Background Level#CY3_BKD_SD = Green Channel Sample Background Standard Deviation#Flag = Quality flag 0->good, -50->Not found, -100->Bad!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Slide_block	Slide_column	Slide_row	CY5_mean	CY5_SD	CY5_BKD_median	CY5_BKD_SD	CY3_mean	CY3_SD	CY3_BKD_median	CY3_BKD_SD	Flag184053_1	-0.63051188	1	1	1	8976	2107	3459	1068	8665	1799	3047	855	0184821_1	-0.107297614	1	1	2	8815	2027	3447	1355	7823	1676	3142	1125	0185589_1	NULL	1	1	3	5846	1475	2937	1137	5043	1366	2741	865	0186357_1	-0.178334326	1	1	4	8854	2493	2961	972	8192	2250	2704	755	0187125_1	0.229740739	1	1	5	10808	2284	3141	922	9001	1975	2802	756	0187893_1	-0.206308842	1	1	6	10921	2043	3082	964	10352	2157	2716	717	0188661_1	NULL	1	1	7	5605	1455	2934	891	4450	1087	2675	682	0189429_1	-1.025217056	1	1	8	7300	2008	2941	903	7477	1761	2659	741	0190197_1	NULL	1	1	9	5850	1403	2915	920	4961	1168	2613	687	0190965_1	0.137395531	1	1	10	7445	1611	2802	811	6478	1214	2653	630	0273540_1	NULL	1	1	11	25820	5905	3021	854	24144	5630	2784	643	0274308_1	NULL	1	1	12	6547	1521	3169	849	5401	969	2784	653	0275076_1	NULL	1	1	13	6301	1557	3134	838	5459	1256	2786	630	0275844_1	NULL	1	1	14	5496	1136	3204	846	4160	805	2801	642	0276612_1	NULL	1	1	15	5854	1251	3127	933	4550	859	2778	694	0277380_1	NULL	1	1	16	6283	1454	3099	974	4600	910	2844	762	0278148_1	-0.340267062	1	1	17	6544	1362	2998	886	5763	1105	2708	650	0278916_1	NULL	1	1	18	5215	890	2939	831	4612	807	2580	606	0279684_1	-0.94771564	1	1	19	6435	1123	3055	836	5477	1024	2826	713	0280452_1	0.001565588	1	1	20	8824	1606	3276	920	7876	1360	3052	770	0!sample_table_end
