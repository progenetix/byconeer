Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415053/suppl/GSM415053_NN604.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415053/suppl/GSM415053_NN605.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16607!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2519.8332368042984	1774.8630035997726	2592.2857532764692	1683.2495492126216	1.7140924481958606	1.1218576418955855	1.5279054883466188	0.3603	1.28369437380934762	1308.5607555708234	1046.178696066263	1380.3204324163648	1014.3462281062102	0.74773286619870072	0.54753408394268377	1.3656371139754906	0.4760	1.39084001804040613	1140.2833619662531	880.03245500391074	1209.398270387539	862.40806412986399	0.65363048259540191	0.48323891875959885	1.3526031476793556	0.4153	1.33354766749490254	9761.7181406783566	7520.1345965734554	9355.0359549273071	6948.5428209035799	6.4330384921917929	4.5616798665446403	1.4102345364854945	0.3989	1.31848681644808455	14489.272167823039	13405.544301932032	13375.764410126007	12361.90941109819	7.6734940515634253	7.6206023661615747	1.0069406174027276	0.4130	1.33148065744243386	13447.597161661593	8539.5486059800714	12499.808213416034	7885.915769967738	7.483037756368927	4.8266921978304902	1.5503449256060735	0.4125	1.33096807482449747	1965.8716901035837	1856.0671386733122	2042.5415097448292	1760.3514354461342	1.3303289720320157	1.1484558682356008	1.1583631629448947	0.5252	1.43916757318979668	2468.0394653146877	2711.1178420838191	2542.3982529967898	2549.7424060490198	1.4979960736934441	1.5216445802288838	0.98445858721365631	0.1772	1.13071089302387899	2813.8388656486782	3114.8741491322712	2877.2096857103056	2922.4609645938144	1.7720312859572205	1.7838340966383033	0.993383459424099	0.0440	1.030946963824454810	10489.940559878469	11539.674201616288	9991.9459761513735	10615.518530136082	6.5749941888072794	7.1328330613339634	0.9217928041032325	-0.0330	0.9774151072099748211	5914.4536766935926	5297.7942382413239	5867.2422449615733	4926.8564493962649	4.3234664646771268	3.5083378997971075	1.23234038116088	0.1870	1.138355627720599512	6413.2116070667325	4459.5776200701148	6360.4670188450955	4158.0196301105616	4.4928502586161985	2.8274323050182786	1.5890213359457084	0.2837	1.217324614569368413	1488.9921148453975	1512.1882909500459	1563.6778674222244	1443.1057228711747	0.9494901026449758	0.91646183498900391	1.0360388904316657	0.1163	1.083938164677196214	6679.4876181109321	5088.408040195578	6585.3061278527539	4735.2498645916885	4.5362634576680376	2.9106148542699377	1.5585241211193697	0.3952	1.315168301640206315	1332.8265661488706	1187.7097666080647	1405.870235372757	1145.3140330606018	0.81620948889182132	0.69168690113482501	1.1800273903592748	0.1688	1.124112845216625416	1295.4635401953412	1629.3425562602156	1368.097688135595	1548.9635747473783	0.92273452721672389	1.0163606093348327	0.90788104019558225	0.4391	1.355734053787781317	386.25803229457398	356.88971321383121	413.85218980360622	379.77275077082743	0.23466496849506016	0.21809857165071966	1.0759583005012583	0.0631	1.044711539926965118	3792.1960289899453	3263.8341144006076	3831.8118184926084	3060.0107586014092	2.5667650849425483	1.9843414938315027	1.2935097577314993	0.3040	1.234576418243350519	1302.4445781987429	1056.8664640081686	1374.8892466653142	1025.1428687115979	0.81587533262755274	0.62116176183258154	1.3134667694619799	0.3752	1.296995628945797120	2113.1808014512244	1489.359483312393	2188.6538345903673	1421.3846453881322	1.3470534237637923	0.87881024381868034	1.5328148860787765	0.3972	1.3169265124299985!sample_table_end
