Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415051/suppl/GSM415051_NN602.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415051/suppl/GSM415051_NN603.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16607!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2922.4492939136326	2503.3398670085248	3098.4061767248627	2366.2051074762708	1.0621453352603416	0.84621349454727324	1.2551741872523465	-0.0155	0.989305161343973952	2982.0547326698238	3000.9126892782142	3164.6383680062941	2824.9913213287291	1.130682789399132	1.0362376297761897	1.091142375946472	-0.0326	0.977634067100767953	1239.8371929324217	1472.5855065937042	1315.9555435413179	1427.223895422871	0.46084157819769239	0.50953311662759682	0.90443891311290037	-0.0484	0.966984807142530434	10465.334410238451	13361.593407432314	10967.602693115747	12236.25139778455	4.079095701898046	4.4188355121264138	0.92311553365224042	-0.1187	0.921037498106367815	14474.040674633257	21193.80024823629	15172.121464348227	19451.899344419075	5.4183673352020856	7.1930348740620174	0.75327972546617838	-0.0469	0.968046425064707286	11992.655433967779	11448.41783377697	12541.711170319952	10482.885123035478	4.3051824922157103	3.6666101754838492	1.174158769590933	0.0403	1.02829430097514287	2358.3847452698492	2918.5160507144874	2502.5693977850369	2746.8492078161803	0.84774991633075125	0.9666043063266786	0.87703925047923514	0.1786	1.13175169055478558	2726.0686350455721	2860.7656375946808	2890.8169673591642	2693.9692115613811	1.04691458267323	0.98041192780578679	1.0678313400534403	0.1759	1.12966263597207969	4099.6446747568307	5235.7972394838662	4348.9038750097598	4858.5721616867095	1.457839273676359	1.643155942321912	0.88721906188423871	-0.0599	0.9593023596859580110	13924.002697385693	15184.737650228515	14577.680350157148	13917.115876206381	5.0967088520365031	4.8855341735381739	1.0432244808852489	-0.0532	0.9638055549387468711	10436.838027460375	10168.373009480851	10941.255478573023	9314.7035787448385	4.0564721014051193	3.490203707192951	1.1622450841608896	0.0822	1.058661028087599412	6610.7299451565714	7253.1562518947649	6988.576627057404	6679.5210011226163	2.6794001941241228	2.4865849143898879	1.0775422060265918	-0.2016	0.869599130286663813	2243.3380579091709	2523.5389596434675	2380.0864552739131	2384.3604007216636	0.89546811515436886	0.87122257535111791	1.0278293291395482	0.0365	1.025623337996060414	10171.241003866489	10584.824753230956	10662.866275465751	9693.7895181832137	3.7012292661423092	3.3379555428982211	1.1088312047825153	0.0912	1.065272498677400715	2726.0764965921057	3057.0589596003947	2892.4967506411631	2874.1377922656948	0.93788715237022136	0.95459736199365453	0.98249501801625094	-0.0402	0.9724954834619036216	2505.578973553711	3895.0426169758525	2657.4870751874596	3639.4316748956317	0.86120984720012816	1.203644500041579	0.71550183394713163	-0.1642	0.8924439352321030817	601.57494836036722	558.57837298305549	628.92097228376383	570.11043227316065	0.25244410989429383	0.22928262636097405	1.1010171764905345	0.0990	1.071017997056518818	4100.9632970835519	5171.4661158269892	4350.7042356255479	4801.1884825758716	1.617500872855858	1.7566898356451035	0.92076634135124269	-0.3029	0.8106057636398241719	1814.2479193962315	1903.6462132944994	1921.9005518023619	1818.7288668100307	0.65327254363488674	0.63753205030459004	1.0246897286540755	0.1138	1.082056483946505420	2854.7518733373463	2986.2963879717595	3028.2835190995988	2809.140638658268	0.95886900395021524	0.94846030208862253	1.0109743147274286	-0.0503	0.96574151707718758!sample_table_end
