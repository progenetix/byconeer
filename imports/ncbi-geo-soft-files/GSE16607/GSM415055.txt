Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415055/suppl/GSM415055_NN608.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415055/suppl/GSM415055_NN609.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16607!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2929.5311116791063	2630.3559003975197	3196.7106061184754	2396.2740527079768	1.2325302144340595	0.95020860085750358	1.2971154053139264	0.1360	1.09887380944356442	4829.7893537610707	4232.934999697286	5103.7468068203925	3813.4224246339277	1.9938891535546872	1.5869115838161418	1.2564588814455948	0.4037	1.32293672782953143	1526.6993675337169	1593.7946934445836	1734.0119757311084	1476.7768635811847	0.69338937562395531	0.60055905764077677	1.1545731711180098	0.1864	1.13789324730781874	19764.948012534533	12716.565244086465	18437.596204987447	11196.455962653672	6.3234735879139459	3.7951274100612391	1.6662085101938411	0.5695	1.48402729256071145	20129.48972190476	16412.964876109625	18746.650764634349	14459.229524442391	8.2957703029093057	6.7228310477352107	1.233969773151445	0.4887	1.4031598919550276	11369.021269996174	7921.4360853896796	11257.275641169703	7035.4837681700938	4.8249390497120155	2.883456879342897	1.6733175669377642	0.4992	1.41345394441519687	3498.2467799927558	3147.1201377838465	3777.7229999756714	2854.583229619444	1.3911534173296929	1.0450960012644801	1.3311250025323147	0.5642	1.47859692093161378	2512.2347350788209	2447.1908173868692	2768.0052689779636	2233.8400943125275	1.1045531591779041	0.85974653284201741	1.2847427898623129	0.6518	1.57112362493167519	2640.7940706247537	2547.1374771020724	2898.6070660666219	2321.2641322413474	1.246191595983372	0.95545680370904706	1.3042887874634455	0.2883	1.221194549694504210	15549.703207025301	13109.266244601684	14913.609420815839	11547.483050601813	5.4169421663134329	4.0710909105058724	1.330587374586613	0.2115	1.157913360735798111	13443.094563362072	13014.532093620552	13118.923995547008	11453.585800043571	4.7721527760376414	4.1748363352533442	1.1430754148948095	0.2308	1.173521883451709612	9495.6016175945988	6761.8059189632986	9589.2654772375263	6021.3417489587491	3.3092802973352131	2.0129161350191569	1.6440229375496154	0.4401	1.356659864313723813	2098.6826652285354	2042.2653367969465	2337.3770889325319	1874.2228067419032	0.80211869680061232	0.69800333200300091	1.1491617017054065	0.1522	1.111257805900014914	13110.802601297224	9609.0899085353904	12838.422188132143	8500.7383730374822	3.95683189657862	2.8751175823197004	1.3762330698788923	0.4642	1.379530700324032515	2376.7710034384218	2194.9613735040416	2626.4187065959582	2008.1178509924794	0.8513341399287776	0.73392568119933954	1.15997322581433	0.2175	1.162739258699316416	1814.2783896999022	2602.7489137380126	2037.7554875713377	2370.8966878729298	0.84985369363641894	0.96197323700994819	0.88344837563046497	0.1423	1.1036479496136217	246.08809464654354	229.40128110354047	242.11328857621734	240.71708254519757	0.16122482497024321	0.14711792825056355	1.0958883590017223	-0.0418	0.9714164797524512718	4580.7053714975855	4869.000309189465	4846.0547089093061	4369.0452276598835	2.1700722994048518	1.7630845870827683	1.2308384494447271	0.1179	1.085132514974260819	2047.5146124689493	1676.3354121674631	2280.8394887781392	1550.9675930995675	0.83259357780812604	0.58057047153499008	1.4340956328812304	0.3725	1.294560429373085720	2121.2049017474951	1533.4616909106023	2361.456655672263	1422.4947559841696	0.97825984002404676	0.55906907477554502	1.7498013826230658	0.5831	1.4980980276373914!sample_table_end
