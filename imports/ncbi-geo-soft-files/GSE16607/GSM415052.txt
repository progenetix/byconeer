Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415052/suppl/GSM415052_NN606.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415052/suppl/GSM415052_NN607.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16607!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2215.5742033123579	2329.014130899352	2310.9151157022111	2219.0653558787767	1.0198944857116947	0.98277056846780375	1.0377747547952816	-0.0608	0.958757256850932382	3153.4596467226788	3040.9545102104703	3271.3038221217639	2884.6828392441789	1.3808857993145187	1.2872222299746723	1.0727641017679512	0.0565	1.03992075797049413	1425.5924718997846	1319.3188067152662	1497.9673619180051	1282.016873574747	0.63612623931490087	0.5830847894758262	1.0909669584877308	0.1594	1.11678626606518514	6959.9103429866709	7847.2294898494301	7079.6533299645089	7392.2778760432411	3.5051254256654825	3.7830720235945052	0.92652886432097836	0.1127	1.08124646466273025	14924.958815628803	17991.487682319454	15143.405483689325	16931.714192460578	6.8798623353567692	7.4935283012392686	0.91810720648362487	-0.0163	0.988766937427202456	9294.8747886875117	8536.2323107502598	9374.5076349486153	8044.8208031593604	3.9071953372420305	3.4054087446549439	1.1473498866691645	0.1186	1.08570792195459317	1793.1908328900113	2538.1627574105396	1877.1336083916774	2416.5548528103691	0.88552696075226545	1.113041451270153	0.79559207767306583	-0.0588	0.960065600897973668	1965.368151147889	2246.7929311310636	2054.3007308898191	2142.9574513838006	0.8856246913191641	0.96076312808757114	0.92179296376831987	-0.0355	0.975708402121333369	2646.9120587709731	2717.6663957152796	2756.055794677749	2583.387556230351	1.1349106133669737	1.093724409436837	1.0376568389392933	0.0421	1.029602594635513610	7864.3275566653656	10203.594417877895	7962.1458614286385	9619.8975864611784	3.8909467287971071	4.706702564239726	0.82668209339580678	-0.1025	0.9313990648777895611	12939.057847421576	12778.924814348335	13094.434350829772	12066.204357183398	6.807114234600232	6.0061669674915681	1.1333541460708301	-0.0722	0.9512059973028927912	3986.5137584457484	4188.6818815401875	4118.4814871077788	3961.3754527943324	2.2051445476861762	2.0944686497047127	1.0528419931217718	-0.0440	0.9699579511497075113	1545.1556131003815	1836.9618726902215	1621.1540943863019	1760.2593135995498	0.74132905442578045	0.83421456385645187	0.88865513327737256	-0.1172	0.9219881649317438514	7406.9441388592595	9232.690119823259	7519.2733330871561	8700.4065246091886	3.5763568537526824	4.1744901513596657	0.85671704186146724	-0.1854	0.8794173498789336115	2080.2012237041035	2063.2235321662301	2171.6350569926653	1970.2257442231119	0.96099186128568259	0.91476042451889361	1.0505393931871327	0.0350	1.024559094846072116	1743.2178864850575	2402.5411361279412	1825.9714572471728	2288.0209734788191	0.81028230243210497	0.99103872430102025	0.81760912319909318	0.0934	1.066877595172449217	548.32399589030695	552.654912270713	580.75769960993705	568.02211005904599	0.2528499161378141	0.2376935578931518	1.0637642785904842	-0.0403	0.9724511990208745118	3216.4128877360563	4197.7568721983371	3336.6970916137116	3968.8645788632261	1.6180676734418604	1.9461580451453684	0.83141637827312165	-0.2919	0.8168328343855096919	1433.2843348560211	1657.4422450671241	1505.9498140854803	1593.5290130109033	0.66738786336359557	0.72094233707302358	0.92571600951213984	-0.1363	0.9098565264175382320	1585.1307920048771	1546.3916922626688	1662.4168967237435	1492.7998613032687	0.72634593786943269	0.65064788035229837	1.1163425868322925	0.0596	1.0421894299735175!sample_table_end
