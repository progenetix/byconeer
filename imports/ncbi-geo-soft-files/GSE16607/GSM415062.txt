Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415062/suppl/GSM415062_NN612.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415062/suppl/GSM415062_NN613.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16607!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2168.2515529977381	2441.5389874415368	2295.2360144197551	2292.7529483547664	0.97945906922230086	1.033448700698411	0.94775780216316141	-0.1769	0.884582253573181882	3958.9961456189999	5040.3764482550005	4034.975844744497	4783.4419970458184	1.5446031365833763	1.9549861240534516	0.79008393848893888	-0.0572	0.961127642712470753	1477.432854866888	2074.0639633189908	1611.3805388602495	1938.4227532776599	0.60807875537457468	0.80123879904913287	0.75892325246382208	-0.2926	0.816423868364874574	9977.7722541164894	12158.318202187977	9820.4466101115631	11382.656703692701	4.483954870284057	5.1920913017926713	0.86361248476810948	-0.1323	0.912395284114970515	15184.035302422775	16690.184826347308	14934.695282051116	15544.228226159059	6.491107811701097	6.9918391503100565	0.92838345850865944	-0.0259	0.982198844247705546	9186.6229111738885	7244.0987055342994	9069.0516286537895	6844.4618557592839	4.0759222766681882	3.2132854450018979	1.2684594463925007	0.3173	1.24597709724984327	2906.1754958293654	2439.0585868758831	3012.5097155474591	2290.5393263560827	1.3219079364371766	1.0110980038363322	1.307398423715171	0.5875	1.50267702229457098	1706.6170132005009	2267.8644889342127	1838.7029110767096	2125.260082344751	0.8075330690143091	0.97807685865397409	0.82563355003167482	0.0123	1.00856921019376299	2906.833320668708	4126.9367413700875	3016.6197623607914	3913.5600215512486	1.3539571997463882	1.73801150546506	0.7790266033849379	-0.2917	0.8169633260505347910	10100.552347958519	9405.3193255048791	9937.0455801769913	8849.3854452183659	4.523585390859405	4.085903027227114	1.1071201055716986	0.0974	1.069858312279481811	9000.1456207951524	11881.73042237239	8873.6165194180721	11129.682213002048	4.1806699123041806	4.8152906788873002	0.86820717399977076	-0.1609	0.8944420001181936412	7418.9045307404394	5875.574057780892	7355.6288597855464	5567.6412669541751	3.3042684620682055	2.4270043397208467	1.3614596430627977	0.3536	1.277704327853259613	1589.6590057239262	2117.4163300549844	1723.3667501785437	1980.0111286773845	0.70361110788556891	0.87308798664297638	0.80588797309072357	-0.0980	0.9343125243095218314	9197.5103216533862	8995.5555782341125	9081.9173679491505	8471.5933470553882	3.8225335220490346	3.5675734422843473	1.0714659652812737	-0.0273	0.9812649324618322215	2422.924740439269	2495.2991481756617	2543.6026650559593	2346.368122545925	1.0342349865003624	1.0348293894241161	0.99942560297395056	0.0225	1.015720646100439816	1814.4693991635891	2446.5810753660649	1946.6394596107943	2297.2720538182784	0.91088434637019688	1.0642832392996149	0.85586647683151817	0.0569	1.040210264042600317	429.057510578831	672.03813214725221	518.18532655480669	633.86763958894585	0.25252227476485917	0.30736381485012004	0.82157450735701187	-0.2647	0.832371032952209618	3138.2275694236996	3579.1325270572124	3240.866434637891	3392.439803120677	1.5415578531107144	1.6068564604273035	0.95936251374984371	0.0433	1.030451249223759919	2119.3537008667795	2190.1192909517845	2245.8783024246982	2050.1500965413775	0.9801856050254808	0.93810138254222364	1.0448610600798929	-0.0516	0.9648330299406073820	1345.9972153410367	1921.1256904256848	1480.9073758591924	1792.6056561959933	0.61683707550484201	0.76586980682617545	0.80540722457915315	-0.2949	0.81511297674022398!sample_table_end
