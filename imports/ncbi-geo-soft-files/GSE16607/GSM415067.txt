Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415067/suppl/GSM415067_NN626.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415067/suppl/GSM415067_NN627.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16607!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2105.7713114103572	1879.5450486970919	2158.4478332448903	1867.9942660206159	0.85906410064069405	0.80670360875740277	1.0649067282145226	0.0062	1.00429477016374262	2400.5030201550039	4557.1082039270495	2450.3959619633579	4343.9701876842037	0.93396920677030171	1.7760547370264184	0.52586735492961845	-0.5804	0.668782313738283453	1467.6840999640099	1417.6950106155466	1527.7705335180631	1437.0043102373788	0.57382827532337088	0.56422310130709441	1.0170237163172242	0.0528	1.03724475793432294	8081.7874861318069	11073.667091878639	7774.2045818661672	10153.899696345637	3.3206444586039527	4.3661814193790658	0.7605374444280868	-0.4147	0.750193603086296235	10845.940678320461	15512.287218756233	10310.621350710104	14238.871811742667	4.0361954747196949	5.9767116553865742	0.67532042826292793	-0.3270	0.797215529421532626	6527.1953942410364	8921.0567834758986	6380.1536932297749	8242.9961663629492	2.5631290885982292	3.4294096745284977	0.74739658770882433	-0.3498	0.78468820285031767	1764.0244508947594	2697.0525313098856	1820.7988389450825	2620.031863063532	0.73905437581317412	1.019576398224076	0.72486414662057475	-0.2036	0.868383221489532738	1343.1749765526247	2047.9091464697328	1403.1877936015621	2022.1489574017321	0.58661762865546641	0.8575426695326831	0.68406815135524746	-0.3232	0.79927765858469999	3319.1807921530822	3446.5004335881572	3351.1013421591842	3319.7137194684337	1.3695514602432812	1.3355040503430393	1.0254940521457021	0.1479	1.107978402212067610	9032.5618526163598	10461.460115577454	8631.7218361631167	9606.0819230596917	3.5226721833445303	4.0069439686609023	0.87914186245079629	-0.1208	0.9196936951982814811	5101.1493009636451	9831.8015634785152	5064.4613869023678	9049.8907526243602	2.2506997885081934	3.4739227534248838	0.64788423585103183	-0.5494	0.6833221084509382112	4969.1095979018664	6115.581665197873	4929.4119846368703	5752.0340376119457	2.2501419740183985	2.3407748030991318	0.96128084215502596	-0.3286	0.7962914175723009313	1492.2863981652233	1494.1302281370492	1553.474873585041	1508.6261876714657	0.59377113147185778	0.65759347806037505	0.90294559067591973	-0.0144	0.9900851327383276614	6362.7096954730168	7917.4293147415037	6221.4857678756352	7351.1897843541883	2.4339200889679251	2.9131921566658887	0.83548216460719704	-0.2564	0.8371915120907370615	2351.7601812171583	1937.7352653240685	2400.4245420455163	1920.690095258321	0.92388876164512779	0.79304998749981004	1.1649817492057513	-0.0007	0.9994832420858945616	1860.8250075806125	2351.6967248595106	1917.3626979183316	2302.4738072569289	0.75942588812244494	0.89004227932526281	0.85324698136605648	-0.1304	0.913587485038599117	449.74177925177554	415.39442285846854	445.50399271001231	469.31310695201915	0.19587360385227137	0.19637046356621318	0.99746978387218466	0.1373	1.099820925214413318	3091.0858262765255	3943.4361608821023	3125.096956378763	3782.0541458568059	1.3392601803142148	1.5830678674109624	0.84599037595559035	-0.0834	0.9438356631888327219	1758.2309380944891	1565.0480572081244	1815.4766021705702	1574.4421659504403	0.71254786118983715	0.66505411695689098	1.0714133527212262	0.0141	1.009810755788801920	1738.9789837824983	1594.022130706644	1797.4088970072646	1601.9891887548611	0.70626196881069692	0.63005598402232676	1.1209511324721737	-0.1537	0.89894330095627006!sample_table_end
