Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415064/suppl/GSM415064_NN620.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415064/suppl/GSM415064_NN621.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16607!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	1789.369794381234	2203.8280145295694	2003.5930494296092	1986.299170325603	0.87118080712010082	0.89187755449909345	0.97679418292949804	-0.2666	0.831280456514480022	2522.9523490030119	2578.224240993276	2757.5231495359508	2315.3786568558712	1.1602837574513531	1.022007721241144	1.1352984261628518	0.0228	1.0159086453767213	771.74880845999201	1076.1576970834533	928.17738862844874	1008.605316718666	0.4001416823910855	0.46052602955738992	0.8688796218004452	-0.0716	0.95156756158344584	7221.1956939080619	8590.3087271235854	7245.9235632986511	7619.485789676015	3.4021797225947896	3.5483098107219848	0.95881698726372988	-0.1476	0.902721513040474325	9535.2835660063702	15141.558709121618	9361.7206635755974	13211.349107959035	3.8342094218494953	5.919339934141493	0.6477427322148861	-0.3220	0.799964789183444386	6932.7977319745023	10758.425699333036	6976.2176509730934	9472.8528162013281	2.9920849252077368	4.134218578075747	0.7237365099840436	-0.3217	0.800111757426053457	1365.0862223214028	2392.1267032734859	1560.7322785570818	2151.6420077035282	0.69507862425339029	0.9292219554824559	0.7480221707552126	-0.1859	0.879095094598318368	1291.2650124947834	2508.6389043161012	1483.0722523145528	2254.7251343168032	0.63083177122542733	1.0116943173034842	0.62353989780906605	-0.3595	0.779452841132181389	3236.9481753417949	3427.0167205341822	3469.4695779517883	3062.8285347358051	1.4855767696373205	1.3493588707022346	1.1009500896260422	-0.0712	0.9518641286895798110	7489.7491833071153	11295.054032224974	7498.6225505219209	9945.2486833070125	3.2617293594167869	4.4225529949686209	0.73752182577066661	-0.3441	0.7878249363177318711	4859.4882591776441	7808.7245795252484	5031.1500894910623	6933.1694652268725	2.382728652100413	3.1961061597255225	0.7455098588793555	-0.1682	0.8899309343614073612	4129.9488206378128	5111.9511521354571	4326.3172029620364	4551.9011792452484	2.0261011660624013	2.056776165236446	0.98508588358202853	-0.2255	0.8552926639500334513	1257.2331866841664	1671.1156276621871	1446.939024418157	1520.3417672021003	0.60924624422503371	0.67871883271108757	0.89764157831225755	-0.0595	0.9595957893683930714	4137.7929141915556	7396.914519111283	4332.0043616610801	6570.2194649971525	1.8963456835997692	2.9494765966208343	0.64294311939019311	-0.3035	0.8102825466191877515	1388.9231977601278	1920.031342514593	1585.9725728932465	1737.6228254355531	0.65066813593120765	0.75959366041681564	0.85660027174813869	-0.0330	0.9773985619416174516	1150.9611663857306	2199.3648366814591	1335.0213984741156	1982.4709674092342	0.55315191240427841	0.79628241580907111	0.69466799896898712	-0.1936	0.8744418175816943717	408.3056886638982	594.09142556594452	470.42860474369297	580.9033121534577	0.21457107874775128	0.26471942978039187	0.81056036923982833	-0.1093	0.9270491061495149718	2667.4088899957283	3819.1630986090008	2900.4787740266133	3406.6509432764569	1.4210793763267626	1.6353168013144426	0.86899331993930529	-0.2934	0.8159686102213732419	868.25294425924062	1161.9136306038913	1033.9741860354159	1082.5893234964847	0.45504715370666154	0.50343021708911306	0.90389320755872082	-0.0753	0.9491568223714940120	1463.6801947151082	2069.5554768703255	1664.7814236449749	1868.9752162105481	0.64706014641292964	0.80247181319622973	0.8063337998573451	-0.1727	0.88716734442691769!sample_table_end
