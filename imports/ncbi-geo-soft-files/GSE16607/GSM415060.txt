Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415060/suppl/GSM415060_NN614.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415060/suppl/GSM415060_NN615.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16607!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2828.7007784598495	2735.3162824415699	2884.5408198906252	2665.9332922388662	1.0281680316026967	0.99433506697156038	1.0340257180451065	-0.0455	0.968931948806702192	2307.9599677130732	2187.3868150708286	2371.5745384724191	2151.9762475783295	0.89072042018747644	0.86134571414632943	1.0341032706829683	0.1110	1.07998635231631763	1300.4473885356606	1117.3416000437128	1372.1350542961266	1130.8298262233645	0.54511903964570729	0.48634869816797727	1.1208399276056695	0.0726	1.05160934278735874	7590.7727180933152	8703.5439269970502	7552.7822744928008	8244.2245600290935	2.6144174583719058	2.7422164822664747	0.95339572031565445	-0.0428	0.970767916386818365	12502.701226593905	14471.323555244519	12414.864813073516	13582.534935333932	5.0035759190114177	5.7705179401776405	0.86709303582156183	-0.0628	0.957400990388959216	9318.3650814184948	10043.009441055778	9255.9253972606166	9486.5356725206821	3.5550331012958303	3.9508719140990793	0.89980975809652075	-0.0047	0.996779631589213127	2660.1594201060389	3597.7253628222775	2720.6729680678263	3487.3138712112095	0.95237363653188745	1.2099379086896771	0.78712604150346577	0.0296	1.02074473049930238	1737.0575451363977	2492.8881695314544	1805.1427727683622	2436.1707624634637	0.65537054140820505	0.91455177445688374	0.71660299581989639	-0.2910	0.817331785344025959	2590.0454819523566	3407.5598152872653	2647.8015882780278	3306.9759772333559	1.041301315809283	1.2699395818841503	0.81996130419397806	-0.0429	0.9707029392246349110	11764.232401809504	12782.451193515193	11712.93670371324	12025.870039890537	3.7611750363706808	4.0782397908546377	0.92225450911568096	0.0503	1.035444752583237811	10927.954623477173	12429.927320230261	10868.774112589497	11701.079821892246	4.3240797170204601	4.303089731728571	1.0048778869604136	-0.1011	0.932314190996925712	5085.6461809061602	5316.6532923800069	5105.5881997782562	5095.969905640718	1.8149925736866523	1.7439245093648126	1.0407518008607635	-0.2341	0.8501914899621215713	1981.6799156445929	1931.0442790255033	2046.7723836415553	1902.9706078373561	0.69930009113469171	0.7142751299329807	0.97903463501565002	-0.0077	0.9946715843030182714	7945.3770130497305	8127.3508570377135	7895.47271239373	7710.7246519007967	2.4721921076877424	2.4784463718724372	0.99747653842517103	-0.0385	0.9736892562931621615	2487.8047934533483	2358.1127042122234	2547.7140231918502	2307.321488088799	0.84609401768129744	0.83572521710811953	1.0124069495103396	-0.0207	0.985723566182329716	1614.0635554177798	1958.0434100111718	1684.114611640978	1926.2964338814579	0.69165065553583982	0.7337433387078397	0.94263296039439715	-0.0210	0.9855305204199137417	383.40789808980816	414.20187162496842	375.4036178538671	435.49569828368072	0.25727329836071361	0.27478684922343893	0.93626495986900582	-0.1230	0.9182820098341687418	3468.577304356977	3905.3087433395076	3524.724644502006	3773.6590705292006	1.5243719061551075	1.6138891294003774	0.94453322622073255	0.1080	1.077697388473170219	2280.7161701404038	1945.0525367769626	2343.4439116797039	1914.7234192631211	0.7768530197055814	0.66660665540581299	1.1653844338422534	-0.0031	0.9978629568249701720	1531.3710186950443	1475.2059166878414	1601.8283984064437	1469.2900291958779	0.58933927426956756	0.55047413905496789	1.0706030173939174	-0.0282	0.98061698304647194!sample_table_end
