Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415065/suppl/GSM415065_NN622.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415065/suppl/GSM415065_NN623.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16607!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2039.0081581135819	2202.2925123030013	2088.8428870606713	2111.0859689596409	1.2143279034234629	1.3107224694067487	0.92645692110022682	-0.0098	0.993196964587373612	1267.4402653727689	995.31598870395692	1287.0164415512336	1017.7333844578073	0.65980798857080214	0.55398031765345501	1.191031463654902	0.3096	1.23935034972861583	1189.5584090152286	947.23598151253805	1211.3640589143699	964.61990440668649	0.61122394187615547	0.53252566692958825	1.1477830644301563	0.0592	1.04188577281149744	9379.2864331053079	9354.9317781282061	9341.3066866183508	8490.1633781648416	5.9746292420223766	4.9122624351185786	1.216268332756157	-0.0750	0.949346704227160945	11367.554045253553	13273.084183003604	11247.735582185338	11969.336181322304	6.2245957238655816	7.3146914516947978	0.85097174159319544	-0.0281	0.980679525820665316	6318.6038450189862	10341.226643061742	6393.8724362150188	9369.1226952955767	3.9072199820884683	6.1584313493472358	0.63445052164178384	-0.3030	0.810578610576460757	1481.2595450705867	2231.7836603673522	1510.9639681886927	2134.7076939838503	1.0047820341625202	1.382666098547733	0.72669897325021648	-0.0666	0.954913886028101348	1599.239649609038	2436.017972136442	1634.8672819690366	2317.1060485145113	0.90958535532078133	1.3125767206360177	0.69297690643182797	-0.1431	0.90554343262319579	1809.5194088541534	1875.5078016781206	1853.4618383050433	1808.0598729119404	1.2152546946352962	1.2287798270979442	0.98899303832600272	-0.0269	0.9815109636083476610	12301.10108995002	11906.846007614817	12123.389403884867	10757.767916001914	7.0072529924595681	6.2193938790784582	1.126677796695174	-0.0280	0.9808064940741961811	3320.1966567282839	4166.3012865675792	3396.7450542431302	3860.6098655809888	2.7637787594963377	3.0393307826467102	0.90933792901922428	-0.0808	0.9455396485276725812	6093.5266830620867	4939.7677387095237	6157.1040487883092	4565.484959492188	4.4170854145622318	3.019724856104097	1.4627443310384707	0.0647	1.045867218599810113	1777.251891148165	1768.7883405000694	1819.7253787963177	1711.0352948222474	0.99030397961967931	0.93469507717251543	1.0594941642523492	-0.0347	0.9762465585974756714	5098.878656402765	5710.9767927078356	5170.36907732294	5253.0735010071476	2.9237894549857448	2.7063558542469806	1.0803418369382409	0.1386	1.100855598377053615	1440.4718813184379	1353.0810558403273	1465.9466646614344	1333.0996511956148	0.79696495141060009	0.78321361625734232	1.0175575792706077	0.0194	1.01352590300961216	1216.395121128086	1158.6704641881499	1236.701628301824	1162.3182127622431	0.94314908343547998	0.91861038565707376	1.0267128460134423	0.0153	1.010685204818604617	498.35140713246636	299.17798208161389	455.64157729927274	367.41438514771085	0.41722031696874229	0.37815259793102124	1.1033120471774394	0.1702	1.125196191837930518	2657.658438634367	3367.9822128068431	2712.5224763312935	3152.8154777081904	1.9419476280976617	2.1937150794508731	0.88523238331559739	-0.2004	0.8703137744297776419	1578.4735081617914	1497.8170016297836	1612.9085826600019	1463.8525063889415	0.85963655113164539	0.79057366562622378	1.087357938302582	-0.0765	0.9483627969676355920	1556.1971115331726	1546.9992515661852	1590.8929831367616	1507.9519299309306	0.99955775171940098	1.0074000396711813	0.99221531899647308	-0.1971	0.87230128682387875!sample_table_end
