Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415061/suppl/GSM415061_NN616.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415061/suppl/GSM415061_NN617.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16607!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	4049.5227816859856	3494.4502999303759	3943.8538701777152	3503.5396471191925	1.4950546783053393	1.3294687646012437	1.1245504355672178	0.0041	1.00288036242903572	3305.8953105993505	3316.3917265380724	3220.4318557271949	3336.5737866522654	1.1881378413916945	1.2692934683896553	0.93606236144827704	-0.1387	0.908324038233792263	1795.7586579628953	1594.5041865220689	1758.5786744128125	1674.9373749161275	0.64272513882515969	0.65272638240335412	0.98467773963514438	-0.0790	0.946706990608179754	7221.4379202787331	6149.4976345464011	7022.7772850110723	5998.0626757783211	2.570366259172264	2.1607559144656427	1.1895680775252755	-0.0113	0.992206465011814755	14053.907510269726	16604.96565206589	13813.744733484677	15940.553496574727	5.285766303947657	6.3677199468747876	0.8300877469559349	-0.1197	0.920410116652930826	10793.117367621098	9902.022347507811	10549.874948207576	9504.8011652415753	4.0036432272076699	3.7253395600154184	1.0747055839363808	0.0224	1.0156225127969767	2438.5086320294763	3021.9251659394608	2379.0212934915171	3053.7822571579222	0.95779710720022715	1.1826593833445018	0.80986725399465787	-0.0782	0.947242419240176718	2334.3696734689374	2097.0653128575218	2277.1908301384688	2161.9474698548906	0.79480878852680292	0.80837396048859811	0.98321918737511516	-0.0036	0.997485288189340359	3373.2589239075387	3550.7330811978204	3288.9145153232839	3557.5726408127171	1.3226260828027883	1.3837885288493623	0.95580072766072766	-0.0042	0.9970759667438556810	10734.009250880301	11612.791672370511	10494.065516424715	11128.997625118524	4.0097135526274856	4.6922992022085319	0.85453066393128263	0.0673	1.047756908853104511	16793.275682831572	17335.313959288495	16441.107544828035	16647.792938469316	7.25466230244235	6.5181362849192457	1.1129964126750731	0.0584	1.041324528899759212	4142.6629496011792	3788.5279675546381	4036.4239344081593	3780.1137087843076	1.6545886644646821	1.4857278389702151	1.1136552880448867	-0.2097	0.8647423361114809913	2540.6993519910884	2792.6262851454167	2476.9304424083289	2831.7268969116676	0.89176001871902422	1.1304139195274534	0.78887919134241236	-0.0986	0.9339360843604784814	6481.4207588734407	7666.8218093319556	6306.9924245879911	7404.3941076205374	2.3295218902336767	2.7897204261885657	0.83503775803669666	-0.2594	0.8354493048195744715	2375.7876067483121	2183.5432274967993	2317.5433469298869	2245.3723505612757	0.8622662457252559	0.88637672027880576	0.97279884049079501	-0.0061	0.9958018220532914916	1864.7190862157875	2557.3797938599155	1826.204599655998	2604.9491979818149	0.79867992440229818	1.0102604851287806	0.79056831001411298	-0.1049	0.9298486371284611117	537.3680671932002	596.86299498694405	516.21895644555116	661.42742372378666	0.23312177588020408	0.25915831596201944	0.89953422877762823	0.0005	1.000337776951088618	4049.4348264345413	4174.3918146962878	3943.6296178570242	4144.5116860723374	1.7173554028179989	1.6577949827018019	1.0359274944958079	0.0343	1.024036298871591419	2735.098586741633	2404.547451228585	2665.7038476151224	2457.5935857087102	0.92476734163369989	0.89644870613526006	1.0315898001800081	-0.0039	0.997268183049602320	1541.8916490019099	1374.6080264256257	1514.3809377410835	1459.2910918320654	0.61362605364501421	0.5641209984505946	1.0877560936933557	-0.1673	0.89050457803561589!sample_table_end
