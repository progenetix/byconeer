Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415054/suppl/GSM415054_NN610.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415054/suppl/GSM415054_NN611.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16607!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2977.8365432364762	2157.2503146196241	2932.0691431654986	2225.9225773882422	1.0072035217842741	0.79318180300998498	1.2698268139310742	0.0364	1.02557804024758312	3410.0233091579148	3107.2188092448341	3348.8653864248886	3150.5352999837596	1.1556968639246366	1.2210458510924047	0.94648113573351567	-0.0170	0.98826087338486693	1495.0167255315719	1295.4874166914226	1492.335291506881	1379.5536917984932	0.52316817767936707	0.49783496286062823	1.0508867731450011	0.1088	1.07835716323693114	16290.480845238115	13940.374138840862	15364.674621842958	13604.372329780834	4.246873019718854	3.9426547164620667	1.0771607774798442	-0.0007	0.999549252084297575	14626.765563571931	17199.868618123695	13853.933812050342	16732.558697233901	5.6238632184024153	6.9885601277266725	0.80472416572479566	-0.0468	0.968077006581291926	11095.068210148818	9503.1321089143512	10607.751396927901	9330.8538848085882	3.6789177456724929	3.3043869033191999	1.1133435197848904	-0.0306	0.978985384624636587	2848.2084147912824	3161.1856754681016	2807.6642251175044	3207.407018276147	0.81975967691761809	0.96145630097715429	0.85262291805095458	0.0327	1.02292919248055468	2400.0053294820304	2750.4317057631515	2374.3988325950736	2805.1306883857142	0.7937483757336864	0.97647727783282656	0.81286927381998586	-0.0636	0.956869059063711229	2347.9029243598598	2162.2182661624879	2321.3692867973191	2234.7560688097119	0.85380958363288884	0.80102220743029828	1.0659000158958563	0.0603	1.04264909011980610	15310.532802728216	13620.548011130391	14490.102420803971	13292.548280906572	3.7873036188474201	3.5684244076856042	1.0613377743662999	0.0954	1.068354815149383611	11024.757169445271	11625.724009506954	10545.18246806195	11379.709858405819	3.1185962423475848	3.2400426556860111	0.96251703256890841	-0.0783	0.9471969699919808912	9589.4290946167093	8968.2818193744897	9195.656572207201	8816.9132694876262	2.5050059052491629	2.3776142511972074	1.0535796140975393	-0.1398	0.9076685271824644913	1918.7670390507139	1757.1039447097223	1903.4985651402085	1832.6358868745822	0.53926568038032763	0.58918927778931063	0.91526730154306157	-0.0297	0.9796135127363546614	10912.853893232797	9498.821004266425	10436.966109759342	9328.0290083698164	2.7276389869503586	2.4938053676772904	1.0937657855355645	0.0083	1.005760149006151415	2103.0916316815619	1654.4191682149351	2082.2098679890742	1732.2008993702796	0.66063789289887165	0.60368021391215509	1.0943507467597817	0.0442	1.031136121898120816	2107.8893432455743	2480.2087612862128	2088.8867131882985	2539.9208930650448	0.67656039449373695	0.79002901777155099	0.85637410686777427	-0.0010	0.9992989376087263517	325.17706084570625	321.71158541409994	281.08214575449591	370.41583047801896	0.1614009638100557	0.17844222011425329	0.90449986391512982	0.0005	1.000347436211735118	4411.8155065937317	5245.4236764964307	4313.1426828039494	5229.21269963338	1.4059621119576333	1.6646393729606552	0.84460462415775384	-0.0615	0.9582693509052516719	1678.941643780498	1682.7395648927989	1670.2981341332318	1760.245044587554	0.52556177572644613	0.5976454264703458	0.87938726282970003	-0.1021	0.9317072835728906820	1797.0339796031708	1619.1781006624237	1784.4999852424064	1696.4716624474272	0.62863359806862307	0.59459900845318436	1.0572395667190528	-0.0027	0.99816461163237624!sample_table_end
