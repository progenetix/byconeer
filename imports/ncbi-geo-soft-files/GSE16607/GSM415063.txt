Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415063/suppl/GSM415063_NN618.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415063/suppl/GSM415063_NN619.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16607!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3398.3817262761477	3430.8558893419295	3575.7579596491396	3205.3292222351629	1.3040245140416544	1.1856280599699425	1.0998596929923485	-0.1213	0.919360955229358122	3522.0655386987723	4000.4518448300164	3704.1314875444691	3720.8426361348734	1.2904166956777032	1.4015650461221187	0.92069697317870247	-0.0321	0.977964755685057813	1698.7831529218695	1769.5779144760559	1817.8611859203738	1707.2417646893271	0.64197673282486467	0.61672226393524776	1.0409495008798135	0.0220	1.01536321045530194	6390.8304130345123	7119.5395490941328	6582.7050533665524	6507.4755683404819	2.7131927117944925	2.5811847722076151	1.0511423827570372	-0.0670	0.954625188199756395	13184.440754143898	15820.900028049218	13537.609581390863	14303.816239550724	4.9031394208489614	5.3562189148984807	0.91541057203818454	-0.0260	0.982106115541882216	11531.477916609312	11630.022369411308	11818.880399242733	10551.437056573006	4.2329797275885808	4.0381857156023644	1.048238002336938	0.0538	1.03797157522481047	2881.8775563078361	3553.1090678853789	3042.5240339166585	3319.1003780283631	1.0987426903047492	1.1636483365998727	0.94422228412685671	0.0569	1.04022030831194528	1977.3372950628116	2235.8708292582546	2107.7975611123561	2128.8617246976969	0.7852130761870747	0.84431958671056317	0.92999509729039298	0.0454	1.0320001266552239	3975.7774215998652	4366.0567493519111	4163.6294903695798	4046.8674625136996	1.4844255700433184	1.4229679809051063	1.0431897203330751	0.0435	1.030638903432865610	10695.900377677886	12544.411503480029	10943.230365912998	11370.12025849497	4.3355331615065849	4.558844773045962	0.95101574573021175	0.0547	1.038664108254029811	13013.673152314101	15751.366454144982	13376.95078217308	14237.249184267237	5.0043779637513115	5.1253478107342589	0.97639772919808565	0.0241	1.016866316310234912	4577.2071934829019	4695.181114205453	4775.1090690751453	4343.9028687978453	1.8630173222232507	1.6187278732155932	1.1509144637896289	-0.1434	0.9053989001943056913	2417.8892636605451	2817.7329261381001	2561.2458462803688	2652.3564357317309	1.0057335324568226	1.0540147701355402	0.95419301603097184	-0.0404	0.9723708661640760914	5883.096674792404	5583.0782145577077	6082.7069572267001	5137.7298534227757	2.6143601676280892	2.0952843905040521	1.2477352379832147	0.1260	1.091287678621679915	2046.0014256938566	2294.9894519304385	2173.8275743956278	2176.829714407304	0.76501612919137951	0.79742366888176575	0.95935969678974842	-0.0638	0.9567126280278351916	2502.6423467690838	2929.9131211101771	2649.7093875179021	2753.7562652561996	0.94293943547141645	0.99175744856042858	0.95077625768289087	0.0056	1.003890792162778417	871.64244653182527	996.79295282817657	951.44095361822463	990.90703899530683	0.29914101686080524	0.32629000077988501	0.91679492520705719	0.0140	1.009754299699139818	4344.4389070256857	4712.2297329846178	4543.1407369935105	4357.91729034522	1.9116417942633059	1.8028548617702309	1.0603414810586897	0.0307	1.021486653338997519	2503.4987140555359	2556.9069568418972	2649.8698543232445	2418.2548095268348	1.0438124417973256	0.99912705398400792	1.044724429826152	0.0157	1.010926922747763720	2335.9886546064381	1975.4610347634891	2475.966858427174	1889.9917366492557	0.8174593360190836	0.64691180859805741	1.2636333502562351	0.1471	1.1073625461655658!sample_table_end
