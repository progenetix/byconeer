Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415066/suppl/GSM415066_NN624.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415066/suppl/GSM415066_NN625.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16607!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2914.1115272200204	2345.1848175866644	2960.4102017604941	2316.9289978963825	1.0174894283376712	0.84915681181841596	1.1982350187579389	-0.0490	0.966605055310351352	3402.7192596416166	4462.7971139543179	3447.4497497939979	4309.379083236372	1.2624060596090829	1.6655004303699958	0.75797402185518226	-0.1528	0.899522914790405143	1439.5408005652955	1486.7641330416602	1498.5780227408925	1509.8631099808499	0.54058796791191877	0.54494059999060573	0.99201264857351068	-0.0024	0.998341625686449914	12353.336619467516	9039.6890624479256	11858.780594720638	8533.0388416474452	4.3176057020981524	3.0111306829605411	1.4338818725240732	0.0856	1.06112167170906125	15033.441195896343	17917.960580248484	14310.764698726014	16661.555674279847	5.3081073937712899	6.3858454695507216	0.83123016663676719	-0.1997	0.870718283905084546	9683.9931750341002	9555.8552064730538	9358.6209175607037	9000.767291950775	3.3922591136232887	3.2525948124041766	1.0429393482048501	-0.0020	0.998630389571664837	2534.1551108456911	3333.6086724948445	2582.9385840353502	3244.5743407135556	0.89776742761809769	1.1158317234364852	0.80457241783124478	-0.0772	0.94789859924861638	1870.419844752606	2041.0680598084232	1926.3258270566648	2031.9105008803999	0.73644142031964077	0.78453715640344956	0.93869540060499634	0.0280	1.01958089532418259	3057.6221644858451	3169.3760396347898	3102.2861326942293	3091.6638605308603	1.0962217267101682	1.0600255217560375	1.0341465410136239	0.0495	1.034906347305199610	10317.687247625301	12748.604157342652	9937.2943468009871	11916.542279001325	3.71110015758862	4.4356564293947178	0.8366518499934924	-0.1754	0.8855361447843582711	9196.8684125181444	11204.878404837078	8908.3744834490426	10508.942818433947	3.2142116561612122	3.317935437152193	0.96873845710511863	-0.1769	0.8846118856380651412	6489.8927776024602	7177.988514139779	6409.8285782965067	6830.5351757604358	2.297931921569766	2.3528111504526423	0.9766750387627503	-0.2135	0.8624334779257373213	1748.5819436700563	1724.3528682755516	1806.0256971324741	1734.7674598267467	0.64889521543878237	0.65753288441495261	0.98686351788495619	-0.0181	0.9875080017637659614	7162.4727593800817	9215.2915165334598	7035.4854455603318	8687.7684702055067	2.4609134775293406	3.1447964333940561	0.78253506376353033	-0.2841	0.8212419092065316215	1991.9795741413566	2048.8932764657961	2046.1749288613871	2039.7685825406495	0.68897007922791076	0.71028951302864962	0.96998486756501079	-0.1826	0.8810878507612176516	2301.2427131671752	2779.6888299159868	2351.9243947174841	2726.101490032288	0.81440364655548481	0.90527845331357804	0.89961673513219553	0.0350	1.024536072287443317	416.40118093013012	390.96840413732389	398.23049984002125	432.54713383187868	0.15334810078184083	0.15315709576031739	1.0012471183302036	0.0162	1.011324027110530418	3974.356154138236	3868.1484751776579	4007.9743787983311	3755.1601794516523	1.5168634640915244	1.4123187318260957	1.0740234692846244	0.0565	1.039912886018652219	1416.2484804110759	1279.2193660414125	1475.2844001411502	1314.0330449393946	0.55829063027931247	0.51345306749324859	1.0873255329936333	0.0930	1.066612899263343920	1890.7710329565064	1938.99003114162	1946.271683208379	1936.0796531695407	0.67888850052794181	0.65208060159317671	1.0411113271415642	-0.0834	0.94383976995799612!sample_table_end
