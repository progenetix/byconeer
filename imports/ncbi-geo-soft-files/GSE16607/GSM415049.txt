Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415049/suppl/GSM415049_NN600.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM415nnn/GSM415049/suppl/GSM415049_NN601.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16607!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2931.5466946449274	2288.3198326765032	2978.112218896375	2234.472899636286	1.292969855909166	1.0015942001933369	1.2909118839342173	0.1929	1.14304857379981532	2511.4135253847467	1745.5576655418056	2561.6153153266514	1719.6863010562288	1.1305473356818416	0.79199604477646413	1.4274658858945837	0.3742	1.29608782189209593	1629.7495158492418	1378.4138427532951	1676.3078580917577	1369.8956305389177	0.72901283810765183	0.62342468936628659	1.1693679293463592	0.0566	1.04001863548187124	11332.702916738655	7832.597322584319	11039.624445679738	7466.3168727454886	5.0860796852517121	3.3572572660543702	1.5149508310482114	0.4252	1.3427616128499465	12961.337382210382	9567.0040990807483	12599.812909983	9112.9426614922213	5.9560137104704935	4.5395358620045236	1.3120314260146617	0.4646	1.37990356537162236	12728.253904462279	10968.803747640193	12395.146605797348	10459.557521705239	5.5929161723781036	4.867365953007174	1.1490642426264803	0.1634	1.11989627530026617	2396.4403530167638	2417.7977959245873	2446.563558221686	2357.6065221074805	1.0835885639283744	1.0492917079143811	1.0326857210014202	0.2448	1.18494093985402458	2728.985283128261	2235.3205529834004	2779.1112471577512	2185.6609213890047	1.2052546117026011	0.96967851857435283	1.2429424686798245	0.3422	1.2677142292317429	4305.8864359691834	3597.4796151792752	4336.6116839963615	3469.6184746280023	2.0449442670569957	1.6617137591900784	1.2306236593080289	0.1880	1.139219091200217610	12537.264862650021	13057.955671249543	12185.298326301525	12465.927769371538	5.5897939798188956	5.8413520862354069	0.95693495226742342	0.0437	1.030730685232761311	8603.8172787829953	6422.8001903356599	8417.4871596174416	6123.6565633481096	4.3041223690498045	3.0640532761494979	1.4047152517069363	0.2510	1.189997857396513112	6751.1035373523855	5351.9293212315515	6668.684726375368	5120.7241796434701	3.2229670875977106	2.347842706117361	1.3727355240622348	0.2187	1.163706322039597613	2538.1033168416884	2788.8245815402706	2587.9204439259756	2707.830089882596	1.1900292086041002	1.2774917148865168	0.93153575458594184	0.0003	1.000186222247488414	8252.5817347224875	6392.5756059488995	8083.8320106700794	6096.8529751431361	3.6319323560125087	2.5972414249495563	1.3983807285389527	0.3278	1.255057109346117115	2433.1015990767287	2326.6086835204396	2482.9669680881407	2270.6974975750486	1.0955511643181797	0.98207831711966209	1.1155435826455493	0.0398	1.027977413448895516	2676.4757448726473	3123.3774319408853	2725.0348005282885	3022.8971481893263	1.1421468239776658	1.3084925011422059	0.87287227323096306	0.0193	1.013483978745844517	713.82953146627881	638.20533743026897	745.1638065363295	654.59323945975382	0.39677434964641761	0.35245861404270928	1.1257331608253398	0.0676	1.047952586664917318	4390.3784846229855	3883.1224061105572	4414.9253741515095	3741.4879358143021	2.1885393499887402	1.811138900952634	1.2083774186715324	0.1583	1.116006056496550419	2430.9279384102606	2209.123999138279	2480.8698577375221	2159.9257960017026	1.0486745934063237	0.95329664279698501	1.1000506519455462	0.0281	1.019644160686046920	2860.1173335510962	2333.9538469182767	2908.0619388946916	2277.5871995901475	1.2809902789191709	1.0434661604761317	1.2276299198190168	0.1688	1.1241298639415471!sample_table_end
