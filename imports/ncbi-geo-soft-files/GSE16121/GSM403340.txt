GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.!Sample_scan_protocol = Human Mapping 50K XbaI arrays were scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix).!Sample_description = Legend: TC classification = TC1, TC2, TC3, TC4, TC5 (Hideshima et al. Blood, 2004; Agnelli et al., J.Clin.Oncol., 2005)!Sample_description = Gene-wide profiling data from human multiple myeloma patient MM-049!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Operating Software (GCOS version 1.4). Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.1 and Affymetrix Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT 4.0.1) softwares. Genomic Smoothing analysis was performed by using the smoothing window of 0 Mb, and inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAT 4.0.1. Circular Binary Segmentation (Ohlsen et al., 2004) was applied using DNAcopy package for R Bioconductor on raw data. FBN procedure was finally applied to infer exact local copy number as described in the mentioned Reference.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Luca,,Agnelli!Sample_contact_email = luca.agnelli@unimi.it, katiatodoerti@gmail.com!Sample_contact_phone = +390255033328!Sample_contact_department = Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology - Hematology 1!Sample_contact_institute = University of Milan - Fondazione IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico!Sample_contact_address = Francesco Sforza, 35!Sample_contact_city = MILAN!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20122!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM403nnn/GSM403340/suppl/GSM403340.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16121!Sample_series_id = GSE16122!Sample_series_id = GSE17498!Sample_data_row_count = 58613#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized data!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1677174	1.993739SNP_A-1678466	1.993739SNP_A-1676440	1.993739SNP_A-1662392	1.993739SNP_A-1685736	1.993739SNP_A-1681384	1.993739SNP_A-1642581	1.993739SNP_A-1669029	1.993739SNP_A-1718237	1.993739SNP_A-1748467	1.993739SNP_A-1705537	1.993739SNP_A-1683756	1.993739SNP_A-1696782	1.993739SNP_A-1673422	1.993739SNP_A-1670878	1.993739SNP_A-1743511	1.993739SNP_A-1736635	1.993739SNP_A-1666738	1.993739SNP_A-1721407	1.993739SNP_A-1686722	1.993739!sample_table_end
