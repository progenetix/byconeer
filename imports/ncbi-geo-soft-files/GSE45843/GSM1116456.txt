Briefly, 1 mm cores (two to five cores total) or 20 um sections (three to five sections total) were taken from regions estimated to contain greater than 50% tumor cells based on previous pilot studies showing accurate detection of single copy gains and losses in samples with .40% tumor nuclei by pathologist estimate of H&E slides. Cores or sections were placed in sterile nuclease-free microcentrifuge tubes and paraffin was removed by treating the tissue in (1.2 ml) xylene. Samples were rinsed twice with 1.2 ml 100% ethanol and allowed to dry at room temperature before the addition of 0.9 ml 1 M NaSCN and overnight incubation at 37C. After 12â24 hrs, samples were rinsed twice in 0.9 ml 1X PBS. 0.34 ml of Buffer ATL (Qiagen, QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit cat. no. 56404, Valencia, CA) and 40 ml of Proteinase K (20 mg/ mL) (Qiagen, cat. no. 19131) were added and samples were incubated in a thermomixer (Eppendorf, cat. no. 022670000, Hamburg, Germany) set at 56â58C and 450 rpm. An additional 40 ul Proteinase K was added every 8â12 hrs for a period of 48â72 hrs. Samples were allowed to cool to room temperature before the addition of 10â20 ul RNase A (100 mg/mL) (Qiagen, cat. no. 19101) and a 5â10 minute incubation at room temperature. After adding 400 ul of Buffer AL (Qiagen QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit), samples were placed in thermomixer at 60C for 10 minutes. 440 ul of 100% ethanol was added and each sample was split between two QIAamp MinElute Columns (Qiagen QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit). Following successive washes with 500 ul Buffer AW1 (Qiagen QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit) and 500 ul 80% ethanol, DNA was eluted in 50â100 ul H2O.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Detailed in Craig, et al., 2012 PLoS One. Purified DNA extracts from FFPE tissues, frozen tissues, and frozen cells were heat fragmented as indicated by FSM analysis. Subsequently, ULS labeling (Agilent Technologies, Genomic DNA ULS Labeling Kit cat. no. 5190-0419, Santa Clara, CA) was performed according to the manufacturerâs suggested protocol. Briefly, 2 ug DNA from each sample was combined with 2 uL ULS-Cy5 Reagent (Genomic DNA ULS Labeling Kit) and 2 uL 10X Labeling Solution (Genomic DNA ULS Labeling Kit) prior to 30 min at 85C and >10 min at 4C in a PCR thermocycler. An equal mass of either male or female reference DNA was heat-fragmented according to FSM predictions and then labeled with the ULS-Cy3 Reagent (Genomic DNA ULS Labeling Kit). Unincorporated dye was removed using Genomic DNA Purification Modules (Agilent Technologies, cat. no. 5190-0418).!Sample_source_name_ch2 = pooled normal genomic DNA!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue type: pooled normal genomic DNA!Sample_biomaterial_provider_ch2 = Promega!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = NA!Sample_growth_protocol_ch2 = NA!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Detailed in Craig, et al., 2012 PLoS One.

Unincorporated dye was removed using Genomic DNA Purification Modules (Agilent Technologies, cat. no. 5190-0418).!Sample_hyb_protocol = Detailed in Craig, et al., 2012 PLoS One. The entire volumes of the Cy5-labeled sample DNA and the Cy3-labeled reference DNA were combined together with 37.8 uL H2O, 50 uL Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, cat. no. 15279-011, Carlsbad, CA), 5.2 uL 100X Blocking Agent (Agilent Technologies, Oligo aCGH Hybridization Kit cat. no. 5188-5220), and 260 uL 2X Hi-RPM Hybridization Buffer (Agilent Technologies, cat. no. 5190-0403) before denaturation (3 min at 95C) and pre-hybridization (30 min at 37C). 130 uL Agilent-CGHblock (Agilent Technologies, cat. no. 5190-0421) was added to each hybridization solution before 490 uL of the combined solution was applied to a gasket slide (Agilent Technologies, cat. no. G2534-60003). A 1x1 M SurePrint G3 Human CGH Microarray (Agilent Technologies, cat. no. G4447A) was paired with each gasket slide in a SureHyb Enabled Hybridization Chamber (Agilent Technologies, cat. no. G2534A) and the differentially labeled DNA samples were hybridized (65C) to the microarray for 40â72 hrs in a hybridization oven (Agilent Technologies, cat. no. G2545A). During hybridization the slides were rotated at 19 rpm.!Sample_scan_protocol = Detailed in Craig, et al., 2012 PLoS One. Microarrays and gaskets were disassembled at room temperature in Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent Technologies, cat. no. 5188-5221) and quickly moved to a second dish containing Wash Buffer 1 and a stir bar rotating at speed sufficient for gentle agitation of the liquidâs surface. After 5â30 minutes, slides were moved to a dish containing Wash Buffer 2 (Agilent Technologies, cat. no. 5188-5222) and a stir bar and agitated at 37C for 1 minute. Slides were then washed in anhydrous acetonitrile (Sigma- Aldrich, cat. no. 271004, St. Louis, MO) for 10â15 sec before being removed and placed in a slide holder (Agilent Technologies, cat. no. G2505-60525) with an Ozone-Barrier Slide Cover (Agilent Technologies, cat. no. G2505-60550). Microarrays were scanned immediately with a DNA Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technol- ogies, cat. no. G2505C) at 3 um resolution.!Sample_data_processing = Detailed in Craig, et al., 2012 PLoS One. Scanned images were processed using Agilent Feature Extraction v10.7 and FE Protocol CGH_107_Sep09. Quality control dLRsd statistics were recorded as reported in the QC Metrics file generated by the software. Copy number analysis was performed using the DNA Analytics module of Agilent Genomic Workbench 6.5. Log2 ratios were corrected for a periodic ââwaveââ artifact that correlates with GC content using the softwareâs GC correction tool with a GC window size of 2 kb. The ADM-2 algorithm was used with a threshold of 6.0 to detect significantly aberrant genomic regions and detected regions were filtered for those spanning more than five probes (,10 kb) with an average absolute log2 ratio .0.3.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8737!Sample_contact_name = Peleg,Moshe,Horowitz!Sample_contact_laboratory = Beroukhim & Ligon!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Biology!Sample_contact_institute = Dana-Farber Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 44 Binney St. SM1010!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02115!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1116nnn/GSM1116456/suppl/GSM1116456_PLGG02_S01_CGH_105_Jan09.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE45843!Sample_data_row_count = 962497
