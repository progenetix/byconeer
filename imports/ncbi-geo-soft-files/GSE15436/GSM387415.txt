Briefly, 21 Î¼l solution containing 500 ng normal DNA (reference DNA) or tumor DNA (test DNA), 20 Î¼l BioPrime DNA Labeling System random primers solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and water were combined and incubated for 5 min at 95 Â°C, and subsequently cooled on ice. After the addition of 5 Î¼l 10x dNTPs labeling mix (1 mM dCTP, 2 mM dATP, 2 mM dGTP, 2 mM dTTP), 3 Î¼l 1 mM Cy-3 or Cy-5 dCTP (GeneChem Inc., Daejeon, Korea), and 40 U BioPrime DNA Labeling System Klenow fragment (Invitrogen), the mixture was gently mixed and incubated overnight at 37 Â°C. The addition of 5 Î¼l BioPrime DNA Labeling System Stop Buffer (Invitrogen) ended the reaction. After labeling, unincorporated fluorescent nucleotides were removed using QIAquick Spin columns (Qiagen, Germany). In one tube, Cy3-labeled sample and Cy5-labeled reference DNAs were mixed together, and 50 Î¼g human Cot I DNA (Invitrogen), 20 Î¼l 3M sodium acetate, and 600 Î¼l cold 100% ethanol were added for DNA precipitation.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Normal human muscle tissue!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = sample: Sex-matched reference normal human muscle DNA!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = DNA was extracted from each cancer tissue sample using the PureGene kit (Gentra Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = The labeling and hybridization protocols described by Pinkel et al. were used with some modification to the labeling procedure.

The hybridization solution was denatured for 10 min at 72 Â°C and was subsequently incubated for 1 hour at 37 Â°C to allow blocking of repetitive sequences. Hybridization was performed in slide chambers for 48 hours at 37 Â°C. After post-hybridization washes, arrays were rinsed, spin-dried.!Sample_scan_protocol = Two 16-bit TIFF image files were scanned using a GenePix 4200A two-color fluorescent scanner (Axon Instruments), and individual spots were analyzed with GenePix Pro 3.0 imaging software (Axon Instruments).!Sample_description = The array CGH target slide consists of 4015 BAC clones printed in duplicate (MAC Array TM Karyo4K: Macrogen Inc.; http://www.macrogen.com) on aminosilane-coated slide (CMT-GAPS2 Coated Slides, Corning Inc., USA). The Macrogen BAC library is an original library based on the genome of Koreans established in 2000 by Seo of Seoul National University. The average length of insertion is about 100 Kb. Genomic loci of all BAC clones have been verified by end-sequencing and compared to the NCBI public genome map, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/. The genomic positions of all BAC clones were also confirmed by FISH.!Sample_data_processing = Data analysis was performed using MacViewer (Macrogen). The log2-transformed fluorescent ratios were calculated from background-subtracted mean intensity values, and these ratios were used to perform normalization according to intensity normalization methods. LOWESS normalization was applied, a smoothing adjustment that removes intensity-dependent variation in dye bias.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5772!Sample_contact_name = Nobumoto,,Tomioka!Sample_contact_email = nmhtomsf@hotmail.com!Sample_contact_phone = 81-11-716-1161!Sample_contact_fax = 81-717-7515!Sample_contact_department = General Surgery!Sample_contact_institute = Hokkaido University!Sample_contact_address = Nishi 7 chome, Kita 15 jo, Kita-ku!Sample_contact_city = Sapporo!Sample_contact_state = Hokkaido!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 060-8638!Sample_contact_country = Japan!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE15436!Sample_data_row_count = 3943#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2-transformed test/reference fluorescent ratios: background-subtracted mean intensity values, LOWESS normalized, smoothing adjustment that removes intensity-dependent variation in dye bias!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE5771	0.19932485	0.13545706	-0.0459705	-0.08441391	-0.1808122	-0.3684452	-0.57972557	-0.49162492	-0.17561379	-0.46162054	-0.12252887	-0.1852974	-0.09442533	-0.03113027	-0.15484568	-0.22632730	-0.2944296	-0.21352330	-0.37662612	-0.2865!sample_table_end
