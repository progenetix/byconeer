Briefly, 21 Î¼l solution containing 500 ng normal DNA (reference DNA) or tumor DNA (test DNA), 20 Î¼l BioPrime DNA Labeling System random primers solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and water were combined and incubated for 5 min at 95 Â°C, and subsequently cooled on ice. After the addition of 5 Î¼l 10x dNTPs labeling mix (1 mM dCTP, 2 mM dATP, 2 mM dGTP, 2 mM dTTP), 3 Î¼l 1 mM Cy-3 or Cy-5 dCTP (GeneChem Inc., Daejeon, Korea), and 40 U BioPrime DNA Labeling System Klenow fragment (Invitrogen), the mixture was gently mixed and incubated overnight at 37 Â°C. The addition of 5 Î¼l BioPrime DNA Labeling System Stop Buffer (Invitrogen) ended the reaction. After labeling, unincorporated fluorescent nucleotides were removed using QIAquick Spin columns (Qiagen, Germany). In one tube, Cy3-labeled sample and Cy5-labeled reference DNAs were mixed together, and 50 Î¼g human Cot I DNA (Invitrogen), 20 Î¼l 3M sodium acetate, and 600 Î¼l cold 100% ethanol were added for DNA precipitation.!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Normal human muscle tissue!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = sample: Sex-matched reference normal human muscle DNA!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = DNA was extracted from each cancer tissue sample using the PureGene kit (Gentra Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = The labeling and hybridization protocols described by Pinkel et al. were used with some modification to the labeling procedure.

The hybridization solution was denatured for 10 min at 72 Â°C and was subsequently incubated for 1 hour at 37 Â°C to allow blocking of repetitive sequences. Hybridization was performed in slide chambers for 48 hours at 37 Â°C. After post-hybridization washes, arrays were rinsed, spin-dried.!Sample_scan_protocol = Two 16-bit TIFF image files were scanned using a GenePix 4200A two-color fluorescent scanner (Axon Instruments), and individual spots were analyzed with GenePix Pro 3.0 imaging software (Axon Instruments).!Sample_description = v!Sample_data_processing = Data analysis was performed using MacViewer (Macrogen). The log2-transformed fluorescent ratios were calculated from background-subtracted mean intensity values, and these ratios were used to perform normalization according to intensity normalization methods. LOWESS normalization was applied, a smoothing adjustment that removes intensity-dependent variation in dye bias.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5772!Sample_contact_name = Nobumoto,,Tomioka!Sample_contact_email = nmhtomsf@hotmail.com!Sample_contact_phone = 81-11-716-1161!Sample_contact_fax = 81-717-7515!Sample_contact_department = General Surgery!Sample_contact_institute = Hokkaido University!Sample_contact_address = Nishi 7 chome, Kita 15 jo, Kita-ku!Sample_contact_city = Sapporo!Sample_contact_state = Hokkaido!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 060-8638!Sample_contact_country = Japan!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE15436!Sample_data_row_count = 3943#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2-transformed test/reference fluorescent ratios: background-subtracted mean intensity values, LOWESS normalized, smoothing adjustment that removes intensity-dependent variation in dye bias!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE5771	-0.24512485	-0.17615706	0.0167705	0.17221391	0.1333122	0.1003452	-0.06872557	0.12682492	0.01111379	-0.34082054	0.03262887	-0.01012974	-0.05622533	-0.00083027	0.05414568	-0.02722730	-0.2172296	-0.21752330	-0.22782612	-0.0161!sample_table_end
