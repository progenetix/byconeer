CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689828/suppl/GSM1689828_20090121_MM02_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689828/suppl/GSM1689828_20090121_MM02_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	BB	0.009849	BB	628.116943	1536.791382SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.004128	BB	250.438995	836.411255SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.034791	BB	2039.194580	5447.726562SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.010873	BB	494.430969	1076.156860SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.004328	AA	1295.405762	280.321259SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.006479	AA	2777.226318	400.778778SNP_A-1980898	AB	0.008035	AB	1027.613037	973.818909SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.001858	AA	1625.729492	560.462463SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.003319	AB	990.476868	1086.003784SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.010062	BB	532.453857	2467.231689SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.002423	BB	453.281342	2174.502197SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.013278	BB	483.804169	1672.403076SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.007384	AA	943.439636	219.446030SNP_A-1997896	BB	0.005874	BB	880.691895	2760.094971SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.002924	AA	789.144714	230.560928SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.005104	AA	2175.311768	781.254150SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.001788	AA	3632.854248	862.907715SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.011879	AA	961.445923	269.602661SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.004104	AA	2962.553955	784.606506SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.013982	AA	2828.583008	648.350159!sample_table_end
