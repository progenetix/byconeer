CD138+ cell fractions were than stored at -80Â°C in guanidium thiocyanate, until use.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted from CD138+ plasma cells obtained from bone marrow at diagnosis using the Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit. DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = GeneChips were scanned using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray Scanner 7G.!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix Command Console, version 4.0. Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using Affymetrix Genotyping Console, version 4.0, software. Nexus, version 7.5 (BioDiscovery) was employed to perform CNAs comparisons; inferred copy number states were derived from segmentation algorithm implemented in Nexus.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Carolina,,Terragna!Sample_contact_email = carolina.terragna@unibo.it!Sample_contact_department = Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine - DIMES!Sample_contact_institute = Institute of Hematology "L.A.SerÃ gnoli"!Sample_contact_address = Via Massarenti, 9!Sample_contact_city = Bologna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 40138!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689827/suppl/GSM1689827_20090121_MM01_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1689nnn/GSM1689827/suppl/GSM1689827_20090121_MM01_SNP6.0__GenomeWideSNP_6_.birdseed-v2.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE68999!Sample_series_id = GSE69000!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	NC	0.475829	AB	1950.666016	1036.494019SNP_A-1967418	AA	0.005788	AA	1111.149536	411.023743SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.003392	BB	1455.217773	4520.843262SNP_A-4263484	AB	0.034350	AB	1044.676392	1337.150269SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.001155	AA	1248.059082	332.139923SNP_A-4264431	BB	0.021854	BB	1336.405029	1868.538696SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.009940	BB	310.828461	1569.472168SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.014078	AA	2152.853760	773.192627SNP_A-4265735	AA	0.018482	AA	2436.371094	501.321442SNP_A-1995832	AA	0.019995	AA	1969.962402	937.607300SNP_A-1995893	AB	0.074905	AB	1924.968628	1492.566406SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.011874	BB	396.029633	2418.920166SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.002870	AA	1113.836548	258.339417SNP_A-1997896	AB	0.026302	AB	1732.401489	1476.611206SNP_A-1997922	AA	0.004806	AA	1056.145386	346.053162SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.000725	AA	2477.647461	1108.622437SNP_A-2000332	NC	0.104436	AB	1890.397461	2952.056396SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.008271	AA	1061.638062	263.461548SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.005353	AA	2841.211182	907.925659SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.013839	AA	2375.353760	918.043274!sample_table_end
