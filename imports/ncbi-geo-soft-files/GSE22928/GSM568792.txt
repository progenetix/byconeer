Normal human melanocytes were grown in HAM-F10 medium supplemented with 2% FCS, 5% MelanoMax supplement (Gentaur, Belgium) and 6 mM HEPES. EBV immortalized B cells were cultured in IMDM /10% FCS medium.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted using a salting out method (Gentra Puregene kit, Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions. In case of pigmented samples, 1% beta-mercaptoethanol and 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone were added to the lysis buffer and the amount of saturated salt solution to precipitate proteins increased!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 500ng of genomic DNA was whole-genome amplified in a 20 hours reaction at 37ÂºC using amplification master mix (WG-AMM) and primer/neutralization mix (WG-MP1). After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol, vacuum dried for 1 hour and scanned on a iScan System (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA  was hybridized on Illumina Human 1M-Duov3 DNA Analysis BeadChips for subsequent copy number analysis.!Sample_data_processing = Ratio were normalized in BeadStudio (Illumina), then ploidy was corrected using the OverUnder plugin (Attiyeh et al. Genome Res. 2009). Copy number values were obtained using Overunder with a window size of 201 SNPs.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6984!Sample_contact_name = Armand,,Valsesia!Sample_contact_institute = Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research!Sample_contact_address = BÃ¢timent GÃ©nopode!Sample_contact_city = Lausanne!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1015!Sample_contact_country = Switzerland!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE22928!Sample_series_id = GSE23056!Sample_data_row_count = 1144121#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200050-0_T_R_1526882020	2.37	0.8331	0.994	1.283	1.0000	0.0809200052-0_B_R_1526882021	2.38	0.9466	0.992	1.038	1.0000	0.1621200053-0_B_F_1526882022	2.38	0.7494	0.070	1.286	0.0000	0.2251200070-0_B_F_1526882023	2.14	0.9705	0.498	0.514	0.4997	-0.0249200078-0_T_R_1526881818	2.17	0.6531	0.566	2.886	0.5468	0.2789200087-0_B_F_1526882024	2.13	0.9078	0.047	1.165	0.0082	0.1680200096-0_T_F_1526882027	2.17	0.9354	0.955	0.987	0.9983	0.0351200124-0_B_R_1526882028	2.07	0.8902	0.601	1.026	0.4849	0.0404200199-0_B_R_1526882030	2.1	0.9599	1.000	0.768	1.0000	0.1401200258-0_T_R_1526882033	2.06	0.7452	0.039	1.857	0.0000	0.1573200260-0_B_F_1526881813	2.07	0.7948	1.000	1.518	1.0000	0.2428200261-0_T_R_1526882034	2.07	0.8794	0.538	1.486	0.4862	0.0215200262-0_B_F_1526882035	2.07	0.9257	0.430	0.797	0.4685	0.1233200623-0_B_R_1526882039	2.16	0.9631	0.474	0.681	0.4850	0.1626400630-0_T_F_1526882041	2.09	0.9212	0.019	0.696	0.0019	0.0963401050-0_T_F_1526882046	2.11	0.9568	0.997	0.869	1.0000	0.0832401070-0_B_F_1526882047	2.11	0.9507	0.629	0.480	0.5600	-0.1012401326-0_B_F_1526881823	1.16	0.9138	0.972	0.544	0.9920	-0.1850401327-0_B_F_1526882051	1.16	0.8085	0.988	1.461	1.0000	0.0155401753-0_B_F_1526882052	1.795	0.8968	0.385	1.536	0.4111	0.1793!sample_table_end
