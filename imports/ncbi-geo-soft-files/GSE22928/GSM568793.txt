Normal human melanocytes were grown in HAM-F10 medium supplemented with 2% FCS, 5% MelanoMax supplement (Gentaur, Belgium) and 6 mM HEPES. EBV immortalized B cells were cultured in IMDM /10% FCS medium.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted using a salting out method (Gentra Puregene kit, Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions. In case of pigmented samples, 1% beta-mercaptoethanol and 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone were added to the lysis buffer and the amount of saturated salt solution to precipitate proteins increased!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 500ng of genomic DNA was whole-genome amplified in a 20 hours reaction at 37ÂºC using amplification master mix (WG-AMM) and primer/neutralization mix (WG-MP1). After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol, vacuum dried for 1 hour and scanned on a iScan System (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA  was hybridized on Illumina Human 1M-Duov3 DNA Analysis BeadChips for subsequent copy number analysis.!Sample_data_processing = Ratio were normalized in BeadStudio (Illumina), then ploidy was corrected using the OverUnder plugin (Attiyeh et al. Genome Res. 2009). Copy number values were obtained using Overunder with a window size of 201 SNPs.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6984!Sample_contact_name = Armand,,Valsesia!Sample_contact_institute = Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research!Sample_contact_address = BÃ¢timent GÃ©nopode!Sample_contact_city = Lausanne!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1015!Sample_contact_country = Switzerland!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE22928!Sample_series_id = GSE23056!Sample_data_row_count = 1144121#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200050-0_T_R_1526882020	5.785	0.8331	0.993	1.223	0.9994	0.0106200052-0_B_R_1526882021	5.785	0.9466	0.979	0.995	0.9887	0.0932200053-0_B_F_1526882022	5.785	0.7494	0.071	1.173	0.0000	0.0921200070-0_B_F_1526882023	5.91	0.9705	0.014	0.408	0.0115	-0.2507200078-0_T_R_1526881818	5.91	0.6531	0.935	2.160	0.9931	0.1963200087-0_B_F_1526882024	5.91	0.2360	0.373	1.344	0.3286	0.1499200096-0_T_F_1526882027	5.91	0.9354	0.969	0.807	1.0000	-0.2428200124-0_B_R_1526882028	7.385	0.8902	0.034	0.998	0.0079	0.3958200199-0_B_R_1526882030	7.6373	0.9599	1.000	0.709	1.0000	0.0237200258-0_T_R_1526882033	7.22	0.7452	0.044	1.874	0.0000	0.1669200260-0_B_F_1526881813	7.17	0.7948	0.994	1.539	0.9888	0.2650200261-0_T_R_1526882034	7.23	0.0000	0.320	1.616	0.2637	0.2716200262-0_B_F_1526882035	7.19	0.9257	0.012	0.729	0.0000	0.1755200623-0_B_R_1526882039	3.2	0.9631	0.969	0.464	0.9864	-0.1235400630-0_T_F_1526882041	7.255	0.8717	0.494	1.097	0.4038	0.3571401050-0_T_F_1526882046	3.27	0.9568	0.988	0.648	0.9971	-0.3469401070-0_B_F_1526882047	3.27	0.9507	0.001	0.208	0.0000	-0.9729401326-0_B_F_1526881823	7.17	0.9138	0.035	0.866	0.0000	0.1814401327-0_B_F_1526882051	7.17	0.8085	0.037	2.109	0.0028	0.2446401753-0_B_F_1526882052	6.285	0.8968	0.520	1.606	0.5568	0.2266!sample_table_end
