Normal human melanocytes were grown in HAM-F10 medium supplemented with 2% FCS, 5% MelanoMax supplement (Gentaur, Belgium) and 6 mM HEPES. EBV immortalized B cells were cultured in IMDM /10% FCS medium.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted using a salting out method (Gentra Puregene kit, Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions. In case of pigmented samples, 1% beta-mercaptoethanol and 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone were added to the lysis buffer and the amount of saturated salt solution to precipitate proteins increased!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 500ng of genomic DNA was whole-genome amplified in a 20 hours reaction at 37ÂºC using amplification master mix (WG-AMM) and primer/neutralization mix (WG-MP1). After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol, vacuum dried for 1 hour and scanned on a iScan System (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA  was hybridized on Illumina Human 1M-Duov3 DNA Analysis BeadChips for subsequent copy number analysis.!Sample_data_processing = Ratio were normalized in BeadStudio (Illumina), then ploidy was corrected using the OverUnder plugin (Attiyeh et al. Genome Res. 2009). Copy number values were obtained using Overunder with a window size of 201 SNPs.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6984!Sample_contact_name = Armand,,Valsesia!Sample_contact_institute = Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research!Sample_contact_address = BÃ¢timent GÃ©nopode!Sample_contact_city = Lausanne!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1015!Sample_contact_country = Switzerland!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE22928!Sample_series_id = GSE23056!Sample_data_row_count = 1144121#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200050-0_T_R_1526882020	3.65	0.8331	0.987	1.225	0.9940	0.0046200052-0_B_R_1526882021	3.63	0.9466	0.990	1.088	1.0000	0.2298200053-0_B_F_1526882022	3.63	0.7494	0.091	1.254	0.0118	0.1799200070-0_B_F_1526882023	3.8439	0.9705	0.587	0.465	0.5892	-0.1474200078-0_T_R_1526881818	3.6137	0.6531	0.577	3.032	0.5595	0.3586200087-0_B_F_1526882024	3.9665	0.9078	0.050	1.164	0.0116	0.1646200096-0_T_F_1526882027	3.6114	0.9354	0.962	1.010	1.0000	0.0743200124-0_B_R_1526882028	4.56	0.8902	0.028	0.801	0.0024	0.0827200199-0_B_R_1526882030	2.9	0.8877	0.667	0.686	0.6774	-0.2060200258-0_T_R_1526882033	4.2	0.7452	0.051	2.065	0.0033	0.3024200260-0_B_F_1526881813	4.19	0.7948	1.000	1.574	1.0000	0.2950200261-0_T_R_1526882034	4.18	0.8794	0.051	1.351	0.0000	0.1900200262-0_B_F_1526882035	4.19	0.9257	0.468	0.723	0.5095	-0.0233200623-0_B_R_1526882039	3.01	0.9631	0.981	0.525	0.9985	0.0633400630-0_T_F_1526882041	2.86	0.9212	0.051	0.648	0.0289	-0.0366401050-0_T_F_1526882046	2.96	0.7771	0.390	0.805	0.3498	-0.1857401070-0_B_F_1526882047	2.96	0.9507	1.000	0.311	1.0000	-0.7781401326-0_B_F_1526881823	3.02	0.9138	0.037	0.692	0.0000	-0.1432401327-0_B_F_1526882051	3.02	0.8085	0.032	1.877	0.0000	0.0795401753-0_B_F_1526882052	3.76	0.8968	0.970	1.191	0.9943	0.1770!sample_table_end
