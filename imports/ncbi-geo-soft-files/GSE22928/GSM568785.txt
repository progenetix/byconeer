Normal human melanocytes were grown in HAM-F10 medium supplemented with 2% FCS, 5% MelanoMax supplement (Gentaur, Belgium) and 6 mM HEPES. EBV immortalized B cells were cultured in IMDM /10% FCS medium.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted using a salting out method (Gentra Puregene kit, Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions. In case of pigmented samples, 1% beta-mercaptoethanol and 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone were added to the lysis buffer and the amount of saturated salt solution to precipitate proteins increased!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 500ng of genomic DNA was whole-genome amplified in a 20 hours reaction at 37ÂºC using amplification master mix (WG-AMM) and primer/neutralization mix (WG-MP1). After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol, vacuum dried for 1 hour and scanned on a iScan System (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA  was hybridized on Illumina Human 1M-Duov3 DNA Analysis BeadChips for subsequent copy number analysis.!Sample_data_processing = Ratio were normalized in BeadStudio (Illumina), then ploidy was corrected using the OverUnder plugin (Attiyeh et al. Genome Res. 2009). Copy number values were obtained using Overunder with a window size of 201 SNPs.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6984!Sample_contact_name = Armand,,Valsesia!Sample_contact_institute = Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research!Sample_contact_address = BÃ¢timent GÃ©nopode!Sample_contact_city = Lausanne!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1015!Sample_contact_country = Switzerland!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE22928!Sample_series_id = GSE23056!Sample_data_row_count = 1144121#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200050-0_T_R_1526882020	1.96	0.8623	0.990	1.289	0.9965	-0.0695200052-0_B_R_1526882021	1.95	0.7782	0.992	1.049	1.0000	-0.0179200053-0_B_F_1526882022	1.95	0.5763	0.074	1.271	0.0007	0.1187200070-0_B_F_1526882023	1.91	0.9500	0.007	0.434	0.0049	-0.0965200078-0_T_R_1526881818	1.91	0.7064	0.936	2.055	0.9921	-0.0449200087-0_B_F_1526882024	1.91	0.8869	0.523	1.578	0.4839	0.3831200096-0_T_F_1526882027	1.905	0.1995	0.347	1.158	0.3726	0.4507200124-0_B_R_1526882028	2.09	0.8199	0.966	1.215	0.9854	0.3168200199-0_B_R_1526882030	1.95	0.9745	0.975	0.835	0.9789	0.5157200258-0_T_R_1526882033	2.005	0.6974	0.048	1.938	0.0000	0.0277200260-0_B_F_1526881813	2.005	0.7130	1.000	1.148	1.0000	-0.1728200261-0_T_R_1526882034	2.005	0.7871	0.076	1.292	0.0000	0.0544200262-0_B_F_1526882035	2.005	0.8725	0.051	0.804	0.0237	0.3029200623-0_B_R_1526882039	2.13	0.9554	0.490	0.635	0.5156	-0.0555400630-0_T_F_1526882041	2.005	0.7995	0.029	0.807	0.0000	0.3624401050-0_T_F_1526882046	2.07	0.9286	0.556	0.815	0.4942	-0.0963401070-0_B_F_1526882047	2.08	0.8712	0.408	0.504	0.3517	0.2357401326-0_B_F_1526881823	2.005	0.8121	0.436	0.986	0.5021	0.0036401327-0_B_F_1526882051	2.005	0.7263	0.471	2.217	0.5242	0.0691401753-0_B_F_1526882052	1.91	0.7443	0.488	1.216	0.5260	-0.3333!sample_table_end
