Normal human melanocytes were grown in HAM-F10 medium supplemented with 2% FCS, 5% MelanoMax supplement (Gentaur, Belgium) and 6 mM HEPES. EBV immortalized B cells were cultured in IMDM /10% FCS medium.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted using a salting out method (Gentra Puregene kit, Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions. In case of pigmented samples, 1% beta-mercaptoethanol and 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone were added to the lysis buffer and the amount of saturated salt solution to precipitate proteins increased!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 500ng of genomic DNA was whole-genome amplified in a 20 hours reaction at 37ÂºC using amplification master mix (WG-AMM) and primer/neutralization mix (WG-MP1). After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol, vacuum dried for 1 hour and scanned on a iScan System (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA  was hybridized on Illumina Human 1M-Duov3 DNA Analysis BeadChips for subsequent copy number analysis.!Sample_data_processing = Ratio were normalized in BeadStudio (Illumina), then ploidy was corrected using the OverUnder plugin (Attiyeh et al. Genome Res. 2009). Copy number values were obtained using Overunder with a window size of 201 SNPs.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6984!Sample_contact_name = Armand,,Valsesia!Sample_contact_institute = Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research!Sample_contact_address = BÃ¢timent GÃ©nopode!Sample_contact_city = Lausanne!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1015!Sample_contact_country = Switzerland!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE22928!Sample_series_id = GSE23056!Sample_data_row_count = 1144121#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200050-0_T_R_1526882020	2.15	0.8623	0.974	0.922	0.9821	-0.5697200052-0_B_R_1526882021	2.15	0.7782	0.995	1.100	1.0000	0.0527200053-0_B_F_1526882022	2.14	0.5763	0.062	1.106	0.0000	-0.0816200070-0_B_F_1526882023	2.11	0.9500	0.021	0.398	0.0190	-0.2213200078-0_T_R_1526881818	2.18	0.7064	0.949	2.441	1.0000	0.2164200087-0_B_F_1526882024	2.11	0.8869	0.979	1.420	0.9983	0.4200200096-0_T_F_1526882027	2.18	0.8959	0.953	0.759	0.9929	-0.1275200124-0_B_R_1526882028	2.2	0.8199	0.584	0.719	0.4498	-0.4033200199-0_B_R_1526882030	2.1	0.9745	0.506	0.736	0.5346	0.0659200258-0_T_R_1526882033	2.1	0.6974	0.051	1.762	0.0000	-0.1094200260-0_B_F_1526881813	2.11	0.7130	0.999	1.647	0.9988	0.3484200261-0_T_R_1526882034	2.08	0.7871	0.095	1.082	0.0122	-0.2065200262-0_B_F_1526882035	2.11	0.8725	0.938	0.443	0.9668	-0.3932200623-0_B_R_1526882039	1.85	0.9554	0.031	0.484	0.0204	-0.4607400630-0_T_F_1526882041	2.115	0.7995	0.033	0.569	0.0000	-0.1475401050-0_T_F_1526882046	1.895	0.9286	0.036	0.815	0.0114	0.0483401070-0_B_F_1526882047	1.895	0.9461	0.495	0.324	0.4273	-0.4405401326-0_B_F_1526881823	2	0.8121	0.050	0.704	0.0099	-0.3573401327-0_B_F_1526882051	2	0.7263	0.031	2.234	0.0000	0.3128401753-0_B_F_1526882052	2.1	0.0000	0.590	1.383	0.6260	-0.0801!sample_table_end
