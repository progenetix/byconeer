Normal human melanocytes were grown in HAM-F10 medium supplemented with 2% FCS, 5% MelanoMax supplement (Gentaur, Belgium) and 6 mM HEPES. EBV immortalized B cells were cultured in IMDM /10% FCS medium.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted using a salting out method (Gentra Puregene kit, Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions. In case of pigmented samples, 1% beta-mercaptoethanol and 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone were added to the lysis buffer and the amount of saturated salt solution to precipitate proteins increased!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 500ng of genomic DNA was whole-genome amplified in a 20 hours reaction at 37ÂºC using amplification master mix (WG-AMM) and primer/neutralization mix (WG-MP1). After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol, vacuum dried for 1 hour and scanned on a iScan System (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA  was hybridized on Illumina Human 1M-Duov3 DNA Analysis BeadChips for subsequent copy number analysis.!Sample_data_processing = Ratio were normalized in BeadStudio (Illumina), then ploidy was corrected using the OverUnder plugin (Attiyeh et al. Genome Res. 2009). Copy number values were obtained using Overunder with a window size of 201 SNPs.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6984!Sample_contact_name = Armand,,Valsesia!Sample_contact_institute = Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research!Sample_contact_address = BÃ¢timent GÃ©nopode!Sample_contact_city = Lausanne!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1015!Sample_contact_country = Switzerland!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE22928!Sample_series_id = GSE23056!Sample_data_row_count = 1144121#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200050-0_T_R_1526882020	5.57	0.8331	0.995	1.214	1.0000	0.0024200052-0_B_R_1526882021	5.58	0.9466	0.989	0.977	1.0000	0.0732200053-0_B_F_1526882022	5.58	0.7494	0.073	1.001	0.0000	-0.1374200070-0_B_F_1526882023	5.49	0.9528	0.328	0.391	0.3284	-0.3821200078-0_T_R_1526881818	5.51	0.4867	0.661	2.602	0.6613	0.2086200087-0_B_F_1526882024	5.58	0.9078	0.050	1.187	0.0116	0.1925200096-0_T_F_1526882027	5.48	0.9354	0.974	0.761	1.0000	-0.3252200124-0_B_R_1526882028	5.56	0.8902	0.965	1.046	0.9915	0.1905200199-0_B_R_1526882030	5.735	0.9457	0.328	0.813	0.3377	0.0087200258-0_T_R_1526882033	5.66	0.7128	0.552	1.895	0.6036	0.0196200260-0_B_F_1526881813	5.64	0.7159	0.665	1.192	0.4395	0.0819200261-0_T_R_1526882034	5.7	0.4326	0.726	1.392	0.7067	0.0353200262-0_B_F_1526882035	5.64	0.2197	0.272	0.684	0.2908	-0.0315200623-0_B_R_1526882039	4.22	0.9631	0.974	0.443	0.9909	-0.1856400630-0_T_F_1526882041	5.67	0.9212	0.038	0.600	0.0178	-0.1347401050-0_T_F_1526882046	4.19	0.9568	0.048	0.576	0.0319	-0.3760401070-0_B_F_1526882047	4.33	0.9507	0.000	0.260	0.0000	-0.6534401326-0_B_F_1526881823	5.61	0.8225	0.557	0.784	0.6073	0.0376401327-0_B_F_1526882051	5.62	0.7727	0.582	1.953	0.6120	-0.0034401753-0_B_F_1526882052	6.26	0.8968	0.033	1.208	0.0003	0.1473!sample_table_end
