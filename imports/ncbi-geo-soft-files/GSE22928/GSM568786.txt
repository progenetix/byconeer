Normal human melanocytes were grown in HAM-F10 medium supplemented with 2% FCS, 5% MelanoMax supplement (Gentaur, Belgium) and 6 mM HEPES. EBV immortalized B cells were cultured in IMDM /10% FCS medium.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted using a salting out method (Gentra Puregene kit, Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions. In case of pigmented samples, 1% beta-mercaptoethanol and 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone were added to the lysis buffer and the amount of saturated salt solution to precipitate proteins increased!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 500ng of genomic DNA was whole-genome amplified in a 20 hours reaction at 37ÂºC using amplification master mix (WG-AMM) and primer/neutralization mix (WG-MP1). After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol, vacuum dried for 1 hour and scanned on a iScan System (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA  was hybridized on Illumina Human 1M-Duov3 DNA Analysis BeadChips for subsequent copy number analysis.!Sample_data_processing = Ratio were normalized in BeadStudio (Illumina), then ploidy was corrected using the OverUnder plugin (Attiyeh et al. Genome Res. 2009). Copy number values were obtained using Overunder with a window size of 201 SNPs.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6984!Sample_contact_name = Armand,,Valsesia!Sample_contact_institute = Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research!Sample_contact_address = BÃ¢timent GÃ©nopode!Sample_contact_city = Lausanne!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1015!Sample_contact_country = Switzerland!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE22928!Sample_series_id = GSE23056!Sample_data_row_count = 1144121#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200050-0_T_R_1526882020	1.96	0.8623	0.988	1.430	0.9951	0.0791200052-0_B_R_1526882021	1.96	0.7782	0.986	1.113	0.9989	0.0622200053-0_B_F_1526882022	1.96	0.5763	0.094	1.347	0.0299	0.2028200070-0_B_F_1526882023	1.85	0.9500	0.480	0.503	0.4725	0.0707200078-0_T_R_1526881818	1.85	0.7064	0.515	2.920	0.4543	0.1723200087-0_B_F_1526882024	1.85	0.8869	0.062	0.751	0.0015	-0.3984200096-0_T_F_1526882027	1.85	0.8959	0.936	0.992	0.9761	0.2581200124-0_B_R_1526882028	2.01	0.8199	0.683	0.994	0.5560	0.0271200199-0_B_R_1526882030	1.99	0.0000	0.903	0.368	0.9099	-0.7126200258-0_T_R_1526882033	2.01	0.6974	0.044	1.653	0.0000	-0.2020200260-0_B_F_1526881813	2.01	0.7130	0.998	2.367	0.9985	0.8716200261-0_T_R_1526882034	1.85	0.7871	0.619	1.066	0.5620	-0.3439200262-0_B_F_1526882035	2.01	0.8725	0.473	0.629	0.5223	-0.0647200623-0_B_R_1526882039	1.855	0.9554	0.537	0.341	0.5617	-0.9424400630-0_T_F_1526882041	1.85	0.7929	0.097	0.724	0.0498	0.1190401050-0_T_F_1526882046	1.875	0.9286	0.987	0.917	1.0000	0.1861401070-0_B_F_1526882047	1.875	0.9383	0.439	0.241	0.3788	-0.8406401326-0_B_F_1526881823	1.99	0.8121	0.974	0.808	1.0000	0.2439401327-0_B_F_1526882051	1.99	0.7263	0.986	1.969	1.0000	0.5233401753-0_B_F_1526882052	1.88	0.7443	0.472	1.384	0.5102	-0.1573!sample_table_end
