Normal human melanocytes were grown in HAM-F10 medium supplemented with 2% FCS, 5% MelanoMax supplement (Gentaur, Belgium) and 6 mM HEPES. EBV immortalized B cells were cultured in IMDM /10% FCS medium.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted using a salting out method (Gentra Puregene kit, Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions. In case of pigmented samples, 1% beta-mercaptoethanol and 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone were added to the lysis buffer and the amount of saturated salt solution to precipitate proteins increased!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 500ng of genomic DNA was whole-genome amplified in a 20 hours reaction at 37ÂºC using amplification master mix (WG-AMM) and primer/neutralization mix (WG-MP1). After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol, vacuum dried for 1 hour and scanned on a iScan System (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA  was hybridized on Illumina Human 1M-Duov3 DNA Analysis BeadChips for subsequent copy number analysis.!Sample_data_processing = Ratio were normalized in BeadStudio (Illumina), then ploidy was corrected using the OverUnder plugin (Attiyeh et al. Genome Res. 2009). Copy number values were obtained using Overunder with a window size of 201 SNPs.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6984!Sample_contact_name = Armand,,Valsesia!Sample_contact_institute = Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research!Sample_contact_address = BÃ¢timent GÃ©nopode!Sample_contact_city = Lausanne!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1015!Sample_contact_country = Switzerland!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE22928!Sample_series_id = GSE23056!Sample_data_row_count = 1144121#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200050-0_T_R_1526882020	1.94	0.8331	0.991	1.225	0.9973	0.0093200052-0_B_R_1526882021	1.94	0.9466	0.986	0.840	0.9967	-0.1468200053-0_B_F_1526882022	1.94	0.7494	0.112	1.172	0.0400	0.0736200070-0_B_F_1526882023	1.89	0.9705	0.524	0.486	0.5256	-0.0995200078-0_T_R_1526881818	1.86	0.6531	0.491	2.351	0.4630	-0.0122200087-0_B_F_1526882024	1.92	0.9078	0.063	0.963	0.0244	-0.1180200096-0_T_F_1526882027	1.86	0.9354	0.963	0.975	1.0000	0.0241200124-0_B_R_1526882028	1.94	0.8902	0.019	0.778	0.0000	0.0495200199-0_B_R_1526882030	1.93	0.9599	0.494	0.979	0.5097	0.2211200258-0_T_R_1526882033	1.93	0.7452	0.046	1.532	0.0000	-0.1248200260-0_B_F_1526881813	1.93	0.7948	0.999	1.261	0.9998	-0.0251200261-0_T_R_1526882034	1.94	0.8794	0.055	1.244	0.0000	0.0679200262-0_B_F_1526882035	1.93	0.9257	0.491	0.741	0.5315	0.0239200623-0_B_R_1526882039	2.08	0.9631	0.994	0.590	1.0000	0.2395400630-0_T_F_1526882041	1.95	0.9212	0.013	0.636	0.0000	-0.0283401050-0_T_F_1526882046	2.05	0.9568	0.558	1.045	0.5074	0.0732401070-0_B_F_1526882047	2.06	0.9507	1.000	0.574	1.0000	0.1029401326-0_B_F_1526881823	1.94	0.9138	0.426	0.860	0.4810	0.0983401327-0_B_F_1526882051	1.94	0.8085	0.463	2.051	0.4966	-0.0350401753-0_B_F_1526882052	1.93	0.8968	0.976	1.024	1.0000	-0.0351!sample_table_end
