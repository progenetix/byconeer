Following the labeling reaction the individually labeled test and reference samples were concentrated using Microcon YM-30 filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and then combined. Following probe denaturation and pre-annealing with Cot-1 DNA, hybridization was performed at 65Â°C with rotation for 40 hr. Four steps were done with Agilent Oligo CGH washes: Wash buffer 1 at room temperature for 5 min, wash buffer 2 at 37Â°C for 1 min, an acetonitrile rinse at room temperature for 1 min and a 30 sec wash at room temperature in Agilent's Stabilization and Drying Solution.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Agilent scanner.!Sample_scan_protocol = Images were quantified using Agilent Feature Extraction Software (v.9.5.3.1).!Sample_description = melanoma cell line hybridized vs its matched control cell (derived from the same patient)!Sample_data_processing = Agilent Feature Extraction Software (v.9.5.3.1) was used for background subtraction and to extract signal intensities.
