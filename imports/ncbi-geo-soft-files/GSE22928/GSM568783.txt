Normal human melanocytes were grown in HAM-F10 medium supplemented with 2% FCS, 5% MelanoMax supplement (Gentaur, Belgium) and 6 mM HEPES. EBV immortalized B cells were cultured in IMDM /10% FCS medium.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted using a salting out method (Gentra Puregene kit, Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions. In case of pigmented samples, 1% beta-mercaptoethanol and 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone were added to the lysis buffer and the amount of saturated salt solution to precipitate proteins increased!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 500ng of genomic DNA was whole-genome amplified in a 20 hours reaction at 37ÂºC using amplification master mix (WG-AMM) and primer/neutralization mix (WG-MP1). After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol, vacuum dried for 1 hour and scanned on a iScan System (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA  was hybridized on Illumina Human 1M-Duov3 DNA Analysis BeadChips for subsequent copy number analysis.!Sample_data_processing = Ratio were normalized in BeadStudio (Illumina), then ploidy was corrected using the OverUnder plugin (Attiyeh et al. Genome Res. 2009). Copy number values were obtained using Overunder with a window size of 201 SNPs.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6984!Sample_contact_name = Armand,,Valsesia!Sample_contact_institute = Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research!Sample_contact_address = BÃ¢timent GÃ©nopode!Sample_contact_city = Lausanne!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1015!Sample_contact_country = Switzerland!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE22928!Sample_series_id = GSE23056!Sample_data_row_count = 1144121#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200050-0_T_R_1526882020	2.09	0.8623	0.990	1.250	0.9969	-0.1129200052-0_B_R_1526882021	2.1	0.7782	0.999	1.024	1.0000	-0.0469200053-0_B_F_1526882022	2.1	0.5763	0.076	1.201	0.0036	0.0368200070-0_B_F_1526882023	1.59	0.9500	0.000	0.276	0.0000	-0.7495200078-0_T_R_1526881818	1.69	0.7064	0.963	1.841	1.0000	-0.1763200087-0_B_F_1526882024	1.74	0.8869	0.975	0.912	0.9943	-0.2215200096-0_T_F_1526882027	1.69	0.8959	0.971	0.683	1.0000	-0.2780200124-0_B_R_1526882028	4.59	0.0000	0.843	1.259	0.7993	0.3681200199-0_B_R_1526882030	2.07	0.9745	0.403	0.794	0.4281	0.1537200258-0_T_R_1526882033	2.26	0.6974	0.049	1.627	0.0000	-0.2252200260-0_B_F_1526881813	2.27	0.7130	0.997	1.496	0.9959	0.2108200261-0_T_R_1526882034	2.28	0.7871	0.073	1.171	0.0000	-0.0867200262-0_B_F_1526882035	2.27	0.8725	0.984	0.565	1.0000	-0.0247200623-0_B_R_1526882039	2.075	0.9554	0.015	0.631	0.0031	-0.0778400630-0_T_F_1526882041	2.09	0.7995	0.030	0.618	0.0000	-0.0252401050-0_T_F_1526882046	2.09	0.9286	0.016	0.819	0.0000	0.0628401070-0_B_F_1526882047	2.09	0.9461	0.503	0.490	0.4343	0.1520401326-0_B_F_1526881823	2.04	0.8121	0.038	0.792	0.0000	-0.1826401327-0_B_F_1526882051	2.04	0.7263	0.033	2.078	0.0000	0.2077401753-0_B_F_1526882052	2.87	0.0000	0.634	1.571	0.6689	0.1341!sample_table_end
