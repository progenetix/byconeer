Normal human melanocytes were grown in HAM-F10 medium supplemented with 2% FCS, 5% MelanoMax supplement (Gentaur, Belgium) and 6 mM HEPES. EBV immortalized B cells were cultured in IMDM /10% FCS medium.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted using a salting out method (Gentra Puregene kit, Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions. In case of pigmented samples, 1% beta-mercaptoethanol and 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone were added to the lysis buffer and the amount of saturated salt solution to precipitate proteins increased!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 500ng of genomic DNA was whole-genome amplified in a 20 hours reaction at 37ÂºC using amplification master mix (WG-AMM) and primer/neutralization mix (WG-MP1). After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol, vacuum dried for 1 hour and scanned on a iScan System (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA  was hybridized on Illumina Human 1M-Duov3 DNA Analysis BeadChips for subsequent copy number analysis.!Sample_data_processing = Ratio were normalized in BeadStudio (Illumina), then ploidy was corrected using the OverUnder plugin (Attiyeh et al. Genome Res. 2009). Copy number values were obtained using Overunder with a window size of 201 SNPs.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6984!Sample_contact_name = Armand,,Valsesia!Sample_contact_institute = Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research!Sample_contact_address = BÃ¢timent GÃ©nopode!Sample_contact_city = Lausanne!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1015!Sample_contact_country = Switzerland!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE22928!Sample_series_id = GSE23056!Sample_data_row_count = 1144121#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200050-0_T_R_1526882020	3.64	0.8331	0.991	1.253	0.9968	0.0418200052-0_B_R_1526882021	3.6	0.9466	0.983	1.030	0.9941	0.1464200053-0_B_F_1526882022	3.6	0.7494	0.084	1.276	0.0028	0.2079200070-0_B_F_1526882023	2.89	0.9698	0.044	0.465	0.0423	-0.0689200078-0_T_R_1526881818	2.87	0.6531	0.945	1.941	1.0000	0.0527200087-0_B_F_1526882024	2.96	0.7861	0.421	1.049	0.3747	-0.2373200096-0_T_F_1526882027	2.87	0.9354	0.963	0.884	1.0000	-0.1170200124-0_B_R_1526882028	4.64	0.8902	0.050	0.785	0.0209	0.0362200199-0_B_R_1526882030	3.13	0.9599	1.000	0.839	1.0000	0.2665200258-0_T_R_1526882033	2.62	0.7452	0.042	1.830	0.0000	0.1337200260-0_B_F_1526881813	2.62	0.7948	0.997	1.596	0.9957	0.3160200261-0_T_R_1526882034	2.62	0.8794	0.572	1.634	0.5243	0.1640200262-0_B_F_1526882035	2.62	0.9257	0.035	0.738	0.0239	0.1820200623-0_B_R_1526882039	2.53	0.9631	0.961	0.552	0.9782	0.1241400630-0_T_F_1526882041	4.19	0.9212	0.605	0.844	0.4974	-0.0996401050-0_T_F_1526882046	2.31	0.9568	0.983	0.608	0.9916	-0.4426401070-0_B_F_1526882047	2.31	0.9507	0.000	0.317	0.0000	-0.3687401326-0_B_F_1526881823	3.27	0.0000	0.647	0.721	0.6912	-0.0226401327-0_B_F_1526882051	3.27	0.6885	0.599	2.071	0.6285	0.0966401753-0_B_F_1526882052	2.87	0.7825	0.624	1.491	0.6582	0.1989!sample_table_end
