Normal human melanocytes were grown in HAM-F10 medium supplemented with 2% FCS, 5% MelanoMax supplement (Gentaur, Belgium) and 6 mM HEPES. EBV immortalized B cells were cultured in IMDM /10% FCS medium.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted using a salting out method (Gentra Puregene kit, Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions. In case of pigmented samples, 1% beta-mercaptoethanol and 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone were added to the lysis buffer and the amount of saturated salt solution to precipitate proteins increased!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 500ng of genomic DNA was whole-genome amplified in a 20 hours reaction at 37ÂºC using amplification master mix (WG-AMM) and primer/neutralization mix (WG-MP1). After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol, vacuum dried for 1 hour and scanned on a iScan System (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA  was hybridized on Illumina Human 1M-Duov3 DNA Analysis BeadChips for subsequent copy number analysis.!Sample_data_processing = Ratio were normalized in BeadStudio (Illumina), then ploidy was corrected using the OverUnder plugin (Attiyeh et al. Genome Res. 2009). Copy number values were obtained using Overunder with a window size of 201 SNPs.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6984!Sample_contact_name = Armand,,Valsesia!Sample_contact_institute = Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research!Sample_contact_address = BÃ¢timent GÃ©nopode!Sample_contact_city = Lausanne!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1015!Sample_contact_country = Switzerland!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE22928!Sample_series_id = GSE23056!Sample_data_row_count = 1144121#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number#GC_Score = #Theta = #R = #B_Allele_Freq = #Log_R_Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	GC_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio200050-0_T_R_1526882020	1.9	0.8331	0.999	1.159	1	-0.059200052-0_B_R_1526882021	1.92	0.9466	0.988	0.65	0.9992	-0.515200053-0_B_F_1526882022	1.92	0.7494	0.114	1.054	0.0427	-0.081200070-0_B_F_1526882023	1.9	0.9705	0.472	0.452	0.4732	-0.2042200078-0_T_R_1526881818	1.85	0.6531	0.517	2.32	0.4898	-0.0573200087-0_B_F_1526882024	1.91	0.9078	0.061	0.942	0.0219	-0.1492200096-0_T_F_1526882027	1.88	0.9354	0.961	0.934	1	-0.0391200124-0_B_R_1526882028	1.93	0.8902	0.97	1.089	0.9983	0.2516200199-0_B_R_1526882030	1.92	0.9599	0.469	1.029	0.484	0.294200258-0_T_R_1526882033	1.94	0.7452	0.424	1.593	0.4782	-0.316200260-0_B_F_1526881813	1.94	0.7948	0.724	1.169	0.481	-0.0062200261-0_T_R_1526882034	1.93	0.8794	0.555	1.423	0.5032	-0.047200262-0_B_F_1526882035	1.94	0.9257	0.486	0.753	0.5269	0.0436200623-0_B_R_1526882039	2.09	0.9631	0.975	0.647	0.9925	0.3603400630-0_T_F_1526882041	1.92	0.9212	0.025	0.601	0.0068	-0.1207401050-0_T_F_1526882046	2.08	0.9568	0.017	0.926	0.0026	0.3395401070-0_B_F_1526882047	2.08	0.9507	0	0.585	0	0.5156401326-0_B_F_1526881823	1.93	0.9138	0.446	0.782	0.505	-0.0384401327-0_B_F_1526882051	1.93	0.8085	0.466	1.997	0.4994	-0.0754401753-0_B_F_1526882052	1.91	0.8968	0.031	1.122	0	0.0426!sample_table_end
