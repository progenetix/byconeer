Normal human melanocytes were grown in HAM-F10 medium supplemented with 2% FCS, 5% MelanoMax supplement (Gentaur, Belgium) and 6 mM HEPES. EBV immortalized B cells were cultured in IMDM /10% FCS medium.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted using a salting out method (Gentra Puregene kit, Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions. In case of pigmented samples, 1% beta-mercaptoethanol and 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone were added to the lysis buffer and the amount of saturated salt solution to precipitate proteins increased!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 500ng of genomic DNA was whole-genome amplified in a 20 hours reaction at 37ÂºC using amplification master mix (WG-AMM) and primer/neutralization mix (WG-MP1). After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol, vacuum dried for 1 hour and scanned on a iScan System (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA  was hybridized on Illumina Human 1M-Duov3 DNA Analysis BeadChips for subsequent copy number analysis.!Sample_data_processing = Ratio were normalized in BeadStudio (Illumina), then ploidy was corrected using the OverUnder plugin (Attiyeh et al. Genome Res. 2009). Copy number values were obtained using Overunder with a window size of 201 SNPs.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6984!Sample_contact_name = Armand,,Valsesia!Sample_contact_institute = Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research!Sample_contact_address = BÃ¢timent GÃ©nopode!Sample_contact_city = Lausanne!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1015!Sample_contact_country = Switzerland!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE22928!Sample_series_id = GSE23056!Sample_data_row_count = 1144121#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200050-0_T_R_1526882020	3.18	0.8331	0.989	1.210	0.9953	-0.0118200052-0_B_R_1526882021	3.43	0.9466	0.990	0.892	1.0000	-0.0580200053-0_B_F_1526882022	3.43	0.7494	0.085	1.027	0.0040	-0.1055200070-0_B_F_1526882023	4.22	0.9705	0.000	0.390	0.0000	-0.3138200078-0_T_R_1526881818	4.3	0.6531	0.948	2.153	1.0000	0.2043200087-0_B_F_1526882024	4.2	0.9078	0.555	1.277	0.5076	-0.0264200096-0_T_F_1526882027	4.3	0.9256	0.340	1.027	0.3718	-0.2331200124-0_B_R_1526882028	5.93	0.8902	0.964	1.082	0.9898	0.2401200199-0_B_R_1526882030	4.68	0.9599	1.000	0.786	1.0000	0.1736200258-0_T_R_1526882033	3.14	0.7452	0.040	1.484	0.0000	-0.1663200260-0_B_F_1526881813	3.15	0.7948	1.000	1.423	1.0000	0.1498200261-0_T_R_1526882034	3.15	0.8794	0.057	1.064	0.0000	-0.1582200262-0_B_F_1526882035	3.15	0.9257	0.040	0.519	0.0299	-0.3284200623-0_B_R_1526882039	4.02	0.0000	0.232	0.591	0.2348	0.0428400630-0_T_F_1526882041	2.58	0.9212	0.046	0.445	0.0249	-0.5744401050-0_T_F_1526882046	3.79	0.0000	0.309	0.955	0.2744	0.1239401070-0_B_F_1526882047	3.86	0.2135	0.333	0.349	0.2873	-0.4234401326-0_B_F_1526881823	2.99	0.5391	0.583	0.715	0.6316	-0.0787401327-0_B_F_1526882051	3	0.6551	0.604	2.081	0.6331	0.1083401753-0_B_F_1526882052	5.28	0.0000	0.189	1.459	0.1825	0.2712!sample_table_end
