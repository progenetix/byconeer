Normal human melanocytes were grown in HAM-F10 medium supplemented with 2% FCS, 5% MelanoMax supplement (Gentaur, Belgium) and 6 mM HEPES. EBV immortalized B cells were cultured in IMDM /10% FCS medium.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted using a salting out method (Gentra Puregene kit, Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions. In case of pigmented samples, 1% beta-mercaptoethanol and 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone were added to the lysis buffer and the amount of saturated salt solution to precipitate proteins increased!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 500ng of genomic DNA was whole-genome amplified in a 20 hours reaction at 37ÂºC using amplification master mix (WG-AMM) and primer/neutralization mix (WG-MP1). After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol, vacuum dried for 1 hour and scanned on a iScan System (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA  was hybridized on Illumina Human 1M-Duov3 DNA Analysis BeadChips for subsequent copy number analysis.!Sample_data_processing = Ratio were normalized in BeadStudio (Illumina), then ploidy was corrected using the OverUnder plugin (Attiyeh et al. Genome Res. 2009). Copy number values were obtained using Overunder with a window size of 201 SNPs.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6984!Sample_contact_name = Armand,,Valsesia!Sample_contact_institute = Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research!Sample_contact_address = BÃ¢timent GÃ©nopode!Sample_contact_city = Lausanne!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1015!Sample_contact_country = Switzerland!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE22928!Sample_series_id = GSE23056!Sample_data_row_count = 1144121#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200050-0_T_R_1526882020	2.02	0.8331	0.984	1.237	0.9905	0.0135200052-0_B_R_1526882021	2.02	0.9466	0.998	1.013	1.0000	0.1306200053-0_B_F_1526882022	2.02	0.7494	0.083	1.242	0.0010	0.1691200070-0_B_F_1526882023	2.14	0.9705	0.521	0.354	0.5229	-0.5583200078-0_T_R_1526881818	2.19	0.6531	0.960	2.262	1.0000	0.2887200087-0_B_F_1526882024	2.12	0.9078	0.597	1.169	0.5570	-0.1306200096-0_T_F_1526882027	2.19	0.9354	0.420	1.121	0.4618	-0.1387200124-0_B_R_1526882028	1.9	0.8902	0.671	0.738	0.5735	-0.4260200199-0_B_R_1526882030	2.095	0.9599	1.000	0.639	1.0000	-0.1264200258-0_T_R_1526882033	2.005	0.7452	0.041	1.702	0.0000	0.0300200260-0_B_F_1526881813	2.005	0.7948	0.765	1.182	0.5278	-0.0235200261-0_T_R_1526882034	2.005	0.8794	0.633	1.376	0.5969	-0.0441200262-0_B_F_1526882035	2.005	0.9257	0.454	0.573	0.4959	-0.3632200623-0_B_R_1526882039	1.9	0.9631	0.954	0.535	0.9714	0.0727400630-0_T_F_1526882041	2.085	0.9212	0.591	0.635	0.4857	-0.5004401050-0_T_F_1526882046	1.92	0.9568	1.000	0.720	1.0000	-0.1859401070-0_B_F_1526882047	1.91	0.9507	1.000	0.425	1.0000	-0.3310401326-0_B_F_1526881823	2.02	0.9138	0.049	0.762	0.0125	-0.0062401327-0_B_F_1526882051	2.02	0.8085	0.023	1.982	0.0000	0.1633401753-0_B_F_1526882052	1.91	0.8968	0.968	1.184	0.9926	0.1669!sample_table_end
