Normal human melanocytes were grown in HAM-F10 medium supplemented with 2% FCS, 5% MelanoMax supplement (Gentaur, Belgium) and 6 mM HEPES. EBV immortalized B cells were cultured in IMDM /10% FCS medium.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted using a salting out method (Gentra Puregene kit, Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions. In case of pigmented samples, 1% beta-mercaptoethanol and 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone were added to the lysis buffer and the amount of saturated salt solution to precipitate proteins increased!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 500ng of genomic DNA was whole-genome amplified in a 20 hours reaction at 37ÂºC using amplification master mix (WG-AMM) and primer/neutralization mix (WG-MP1). After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol, vacuum dried for 1 hour and scanned on a iScan System (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA  was hybridized on Illumina Human 1M-Duov3 DNA Analysis BeadChips for subsequent copy number analysis.!Sample_data_processing = Ratio were normalized in BeadStudio (Illumina), then ploidy was corrected using the OverUnder plugin (Attiyeh et al. Genome Res. 2009). Copy number values were obtained using Overunder with a window size of 201 SNPs.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6984!Sample_contact_name = Armand,,Valsesia!Sample_contact_institute = Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research!Sample_contact_address = BÃ¢timent GÃ©nopode!Sample_contact_city = Lausanne!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1015!Sample_contact_country = Switzerland!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE22928!Sample_series_id = GSE23056!Sample_data_row_count = 1144121#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200050-0_T_R_1526882020	1.92	0.8331	0.997	1.162	1.0000	-0.0569200052-0_B_R_1526882021	1.93	0.9466	0.997	0.936	1.0000	0.0165200053-0_B_F_1526882022	1.93	0.7494	0.065	0.939	0.0000	-0.2273200070-0_B_F_1526882023	1.94	0.9705	0.010	0.379	0.0080	-0.3566200078-0_T_R_1526881818	1.92	0.6531	0.540	2.576	0.5154	0.0944200087-0_B_F_1526882024	1.94	0.9078	0.550	1.235	0.5016	-0.0778200096-0_T_F_1526882027	1.92	0.9354	0.967	0.850	1.0000	-0.1716200124-0_B_R_1526882028	1.92	0.8902	0.616	0.869	0.4970	-0.2075200199-0_B_R_1526882030	1.91	0.9599	0.507	0.679	0.5217	-0.3002200258-0_T_R_1526882033	1.89	0.7452	0.456	1.657	0.5137	-0.2567200260-0_B_F_1526881813	1.9	0.7948	0.763	1.135	0.5232	-0.0801200261-0_T_R_1526882034	1.91	0.8794	0.590	1.243	0.5451	-0.2189200262-0_B_F_1526882035	1.9	0.9257	0.432	0.509	0.4709	-0.5248200623-0_B_R_1526882039	2.16	0.9631	0.492	0.605	0.5036	-0.0112400630-0_T_F_1526882041	1.9	0.9212	0.029	0.459	0.0103	-0.5129401050-0_T_F_1526882046	2.07	0.9568	0.542	0.986	0.4913	-0.0070401070-0_B_F_1526882047	2.09	0.9507	0.000	0.398	0.0000	-0.0389401326-0_B_F_1526881823	1.93	0.9138	0.488	0.721	0.5439	-0.1289401327-0_B_F_1526882051	1.93	0.8085	0.438	1.936	0.4676	-0.1053401753-0_B_F_1526882052	1.9	0.8968	0.032	1.152	0.0000	0.0795!sample_table_end
