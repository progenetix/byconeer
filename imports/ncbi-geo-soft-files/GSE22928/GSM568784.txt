Normal human melanocytes were grown in HAM-F10 medium supplemented with 2% FCS, 5% MelanoMax supplement (Gentaur, Belgium) and 6 mM HEPES. EBV immortalized B cells were cultured in IMDM /10% FCS medium.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted using a salting out method (Gentra Puregene kit, Qiagen) following manufacturer's instructions. In case of pigmented samples, 1% beta-mercaptoethanol and 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone were added to the lysis buffer and the amount of saturated salt solution to precipitate proteins increased!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 500ng of genomic DNA was whole-genome amplified in a 20 hours reaction at 37ÂºC using amplification master mix (WG-AMM) and primer/neutralization mix (WG-MP1). After incubation the amplified DNA was fragmented with fragmentation mix (WG-FRG), precipitated with isopropanol and precipitation mix (PA1) and resuspended in hybridization buffer (RA1).!Sample_hyb_protocol = RA1 resuspended DNA was loaded onto BeadChips arrays. After overnight incubation at 48ÂºC, single-base extension and allele-specific staining was performed on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).!Sample_scan_protocol = After allele-specific staining BeadChip arrays were coated with XC4/ethanol, vacuum dried for 1 hour and scanned on a iScan System (Illumina).!Sample_description = Genomic DNA  was hybridized on Illumina Human 1M-Duov3 DNA Analysis BeadChips for subsequent copy number analysis.!Sample_data_processing = Ratio were normalized in BeadStudio (Illumina), then ploidy was corrected using the OverUnder plugin (Attiyeh et al. Genome Res. 2009). Copy number values were obtained using Overunder with a window size of 201 SNPs.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6984!Sample_contact_name = Armand,,Valsesia!Sample_contact_institute = Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research!Sample_contact_address = BÃ¢timent GÃ©nopode!Sample_contact_city = Lausanne!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1015!Sample_contact_country = Switzerland!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE22928!Sample_series_id = GSE23056!Sample_data_row_count = 1144121#ID_REF = #VALUE = copy number#Score = #Theta = #R = #B Allele Freq = #Log R Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Score	Theta	R	B Allele Freq	Log R Ratio200050-0_T_R_1526882020	1.89	0.8623	0.989	1.168	0.9958	-0.2119200052-0_B_R_1526882021	1.9	0.7782	0.990	0.878	1.0000	-0.2768200053-0_B_F_1526882022	1.9	0.5763	0.074	1.054	0.0007	-0.1517200070-0_B_F_1526882023	1.87	0.9500	0.000	0.367	0.0000	-0.3379200078-0_T_R_1526881818	1.86	0.7064	0.947	1.889	1.0000	-0.1551200087-0_B_F_1526882024	1.88	0.8869	0.565	1.298	0.5293	0.1033200096-0_T_F_1526882027	1.86	0.8959	0.955	0.929	0.9952	0.1636200124-0_B_R_1526882028	1.915	0.8199	0.022	0.592	0.0000	-0.2928200199-0_B_R_1526882030	1.89	0.9745	1.000	0.693	1.0000	0.2631200258-0_T_R_1526882033	1.895	0.6974	0.039	1.573	0.0000	-0.2739200260-0_B_F_1526881813	1.895	0.7130	1.000	1.400	1.0000	0.1130200261-0_T_R_1526882034	1.89	0.7871	0.577	1.263	0.5111	-0.1177200262-0_B_F_1526882035	1.895	0.8725	0.043	0.569	0.0150	-0.1946200623-0_B_R_1526882039	2.14	0.9554	0.927	0.510	0.9507	-0.2542400630-0_T_F_1526882041	1.93	0.7995	0.638	0.610	0.5225	-0.6531401050-0_T_F_1526882046	2.1	0.9286	0.995	0.852	1.0000	0.0823401070-0_B_F_1526882047	2.11	0.9461	0.000	0.389	0.0000	0.0505401326-0_B_F_1526881823	1.91	0.8121	0.445	0.772	0.5110	-0.3425401327-0_B_F_1526882051	1.91	0.7263	0.432	1.873	0.4825	-0.1905401753-0_B_F_1526882052	1.92	0.7443	0.434	1.396	0.4659	-0.1317!sample_table_end
