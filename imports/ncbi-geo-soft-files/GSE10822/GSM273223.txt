The incorporated of the label nucleotide was quantified using the Nanodrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Labelled test and reference DNAs were mixed equitably, co-precipitated in presence of Cot-1 human DNA (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) with ethanol, washed, and resuspended in hybridization solution (50% Formamide, 10% Dextran sulfate, 2X standard saline citrate, 10 mM Tris pH 7.6, 2.7% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 10 Î¼g/ Î¼l of yeast tRNA). DNA mixtures were cohybridized to the arrays in the GENETAC for 48 hours at 37ÂºC according to the manufacturerâs recommended protocol.!Sample_scan_protocol = Images and signal intensities were acquired using GenePix4000B (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA) dual laser scanner in combination with GenePixPro4.0 (Axon Instruments) imaging software!Sample_description = For the array, 10 simultaneous hybridizations of normal male versus normal female and placenta:placenta (DNA reference) were performed to define the normal variation for the log2 ratio.!Sample_data_processing = The Cy5/Cy3 intensity ratios of every spot were converted into log2 ratios. The log2 ratio of each clone was normalized to the median log2 ratio of the ten control hybridizations, after which the median of triplicate spots was calculated. Data from two-colour hybridizations for both DNA were normalized using the corresponding GEPAS5,6 module DNMAD.7 Regions of copy number gain and loss for the BAC array-CGH data were identified by creating sample specific thresholds.3,4 The clones with log2 ratios above or below +/- a control sampleâs threshold value (0.4) were considered as gains or losses, respectively. A BAC clone with a log2 ratio of â 0.4 or less was defined as loss region and log2 ratio of +0.4 or more was defined as gain region. Moreover, spots with weak Cy3 or Cy5 below R2 < 0.2 intensity were excluded from analysis. Furthermore, clones with standard deviation more than 0.3 of triplicate spots were also excluded. In total, approximately 10% of clones were excluded. !Sample_platform_id = GPL6575!Sample_contact_name = Olga,,Lopez!Sample_contact_email = olgalopez@usal.es!Sample_contact_department = Hematology!Sample_contact_institute = Hospital Universitario de Salamanca!Sample_contact_address = P/ San Vicente 58-182!Sample_contact_city = Salamanca!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 37007!Sample_contact_country = Spain!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM273nnn/GSM273223/suppl/GSM273223.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE10822!Sample_data_row_count = 3032#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 ratio (mesenchymal cells/control)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE461k10	0.43991c	-1.916b677f7	0.61bA100A11	-0.167bA100C21	-0.498bA100C9	-0.021bA100E13	1.419bA100E6	0.741bA100N20	0.047bA100N21	-0.138bA100N3	-0.151bA100P11	0.083bA101A9	0.262bA101E7	-0.084bA101K10	-0.478bA101K2	0.456bA101N13	0.033bA1021H16	-0.269bA102A1	-0.163bA102E10	1.106!sample_table_end
