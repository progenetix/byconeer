Ninety normal  samples were downloaded from the Affymetrix website  (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=100k)  and analyzed at the same time.  One CEL file for each set (Xba and  Hind) with the median signal intensity across the set was selected as  the reference array.   The dChip-normalized signal intensities were converted to log2 ratio  and segmented as follows.  For each autosomal probe set, the log2  tumor/normal ratio of each tumor sample was calculated using the  average intensity for each probe set in the normal set.  The log2  ratios were centered to a median of zero. Data were then segmented  using  the GLAD algorithm (PMID:15381628).!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM979nnn/GSM979365/suppl/GSM979365_15082_NSCLC_HF-15519_SPR377_Map100kHind.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE39793!Sample_data_row_count = 57243#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented log2 ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1691633	0.0878663168241682SNP_A-1669946	0.298654143231407SNP_A-1691463	0.0878663168241682SNP_A-1647681	0.298654143231407SNP_A-1691255	0.0878663168241682SNP_A-1656886	0.0878663168241682SNP_A-1673751	0.298654143231407SNP_A-1641890	0.0878663168241682SNP_A-1656716	0.0878663168241682SNP_A-1664559	0.0878663168241682SNP_A-1747116	0.0878663168241682SNP_A-1657969	0.0878663168241682SNP_A-1716436	0.0878663168241682SNP_A-1664341	0.298654143231407SNP_A-1715866	0.0878663168241682SNP_A-1750090	0.298654143231407SNP_A-1655302	0.0878663168241682SNP_A-1655176	0.0878663168241682SNP_A-1647119	0.0878663168241682SNP_A-1749896	0.298654143231407!sample_table_end
