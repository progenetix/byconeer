Long-term storage was then at -80Â°C after access RNAlater was removed.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = As per QIAGEN tissue lyser protocol using ALLPREP Kit!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = The Infinium II assay was done using Illumina Sentrix HumanHap300 genotyping BeadChip arrays (317K, TagSNP Phase I, v1.1) according to the manufacturer's specifications (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The EAC biopsies used in this study were collected as part of the Australian Cancer Study. This squamous sample (192R) was used as a reference for all EACs in the series. !Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). This samples log_R_ratio values were generated against the Illumina reference panel.  This squamous sample (192R) was used as a reference for all EACs in the series. All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Derek,John,Nancarrow!Sample_contact_email = derek.nancarrow@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_phone = 61 7 3362 0323!Sample_contact_fax = 61 7 3845 3508!Sample_contact_laboratory = Oncogenomics!Sample_contact_department = Genetics & Population Health!Sample_contact_institute = Queensland Institute of Medical Research!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Road!Sample_contact_city = Herston!Sample_contact_state = Queensland!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM266nnn/GSM266078/suppl/GSM266078.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE10506!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9911527	1.453868	1	0.4490754142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9927076	0.8685052	1	0.819228684234	AB	0.8676848	0.5269399	1.436906	0.5170611	-0.2257606252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9706797	0.4835608	0.9837402	-0.638467622860	AB	0.8374901	0.5503041	0.7051626	0.4403358	0.393729398390	AB	0.8797263	0.4440358	1.934229	0.4338965	0.4305546138233	AB	0.2836002	0.5782253	1.829649	0.4011989	1.40993181607	AA	0.784545	0.09744916	0.2138964	0.02660515	-1.148775146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9566433	1.511004	1	0.09211348156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9925805	2.153994	1	0.32950976178	BB	0.8811052	0.9533194	1.169117	0.9835435	0.6924267260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9839581	1.770723	1	0.4462415128978	BB	0.850426	0.992554	1.085826	1	0.130499156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01145743	2.512476	0	0.87210151283	BB	0.8091115	0.9813233	1.596559	0.9715536	0.443986744671	AB	0.8078112	0.3390555	3.409954	0.4572708	0.4165024240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9522712	1.560193	0.9630844	0.5925656239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9715351	1.780184	0.9913667	0.8538502248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9939278	0.5927583	1	0.4179231278305	AB	0.6793055	0.7320915	1.210178	0.4785686	0.836171!sample_table_end
