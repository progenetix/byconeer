Long-term storage was then at -80Â°C after access RNAlater was removed.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = As per QIAGEN tissue lyser protocol using ALLPREP Kit!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = The Infinium II assay was done using Illumina Sentrix HumanHap300 genotyping BeadChip arrays (317K, TagSNP Phase I, v1.1) according to the manufacturer's specifications (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The EAC biopsies used in this study were collected as part of the Australian Cancer Study.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). EAC samples log_R_ratio values were generated using the squamous sample 192R as a reference. All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Derek,John,Nancarrow!Sample_contact_email = derek.nancarrow@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_phone = 61 7 3362 0323!Sample_contact_fax = 61 7 3845 3508!Sample_contact_laboratory = Oncogenomics!Sample_contact_department = Genetics & Population Health!Sample_contact_institute = Queensland Institute of Medical Research!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Road!Sample_contact_city = Herston!Sample_contact_state = Queensland!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM265nnn/GSM265809/suppl/GSM265809.txt.gz!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM700310!Sample_series_id = GSE10506!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_ratio175921	AB	0.7252559	0.7075923	1.606936	0.458866	0.8096671142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9739044	0.7612213	0.9922671	0.631905184234	BB	0.8676848	0.9909166	1.373732	0.9983012	0.06049069252381	AB	0.8262474	0.6358573	0.4559137	0.4898935	-0.771272122860	AA	0.8808271	0.004403112	0.7902796	0	0.72850698390	AA	0.8797263	0.01220856	2.517452	0	0.8162462138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9755839	1.533214	0.9842181	0.997578981607	AA	0.784545	0.09724017	0.2945803	0.02635437	-0.6871136146488	NC	0.01533522	0.4650072	2.32839	0.3838547	0.6088215156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9863428	2.400138	0.9940727	0.47773186178	BB	0.8811052	0.9680395	1.143948	1	0.6636994260311	AB	0.7870646	0.3886766	2.918934	0.4195793	0.6401052128978	BB	0.850426	0.953329	1.101567	0.9435111	0.1521671156724	NC	0.235338	0.4152368	2.992864	0.3445647	0.99872341283	AB	0.8091115	0.6449457	1.865896	0.4508862	0.769351344671	AA	0.8078112	0.002819235	4.059334	0	0.5479988240130	NC	0	0.3930175	2.276431	0.3255479	0.9143045239834	NC	0.04186913	0.1782447	4.203986	0.2405628	1.194199248222	NC	0.02518922	0.5288059	0.4319471	0.3542038	0.2530153278305	BB	0.6793055	0.9877924	1.258092	1	0.6145081!sample_table_end
