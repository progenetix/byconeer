Long-term storage was then at -80Â°C after access RNAlater was removed.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = As per QIAGEN tissue lyser protocol using ALLPREP Kit!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = The Infinium II assay was done using Illumina Sentrix HumanHap300 genotyping BeadChip arrays (317K, TagSNP Phase I, v1.1) according to the manufacturer's specifications (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The EAC biopsies used in this study were collected as part of the Australian Cancer Study.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). EAC samples log_R_ratio values were generated using the squamous sample 192R as a reference. All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Derek,John,Nancarrow!Sample_contact_email = derek.nancarrow@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_phone = 61 7 3362 0323!Sample_contact_fax = 61 7 3845 3508!Sample_contact_laboratory = Oncogenomics!Sample_contact_department = Genetics & Population Health!Sample_contact_institute = Queensland Institute of Medical Research!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Road!Sample_contact_city = Herston!Sample_contact_state = Queensland!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM265nnn/GSM265791/suppl/GSM265791.txt.gz!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM700315!Sample_series_id = GSE10506!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9979309	1.280156	1	0.2604606142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9923446	0.5725041	1	0.21803684234	BB	0.8676848	0.9904887	1.207896	0.9978573	-0.1254798252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9760368	0.4394123	0.9917378	-0.775728822860	AA	0.8808271	0.008282463	0.5538821	0	0.214437198390	AA	0.8797263	0.008547531	1.680623	0	0.2333248138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9849036	1.10487	1	0.521935981607	AA	0.784545	0.1006601	0.1833355	0.03045838	-1.369861146488	AA	0.8135715	0.02067121	1.393365	0	-0.05010265156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9928903	2.19021	1	0.35395716178	BB	0.8811052	0.9602341	0.7713615	0.9931801	0.09374033260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9793604	1.598163	0.9969577	0.2933163128978	AA	0.850426	0.04311916	0.7467597	0	-0.06438503156724	BB	0.9236776	0.9967552	1.685896	1	0.31991041283	BB	0.8091115	0.9944798	1.248909	0.9947188	0.0864654844671	AA	0.8078112	0.003381134	2.572311	0	-0.1099867240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9867268	1.243066	1	0.2802592239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9872692	1.419278	1	0.5469187248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9707829	0.29258	0.9661792	-0.5848674278305	BB	0.6793055	0.9906332	1.064258	1	0.3701181!sample_table_end
