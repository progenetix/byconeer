Long-term storage was then at -80Â°C after access RNAlater was removed.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = As per QIAGEN tissue lyser protocol using ALLPREP Kit!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = The Infinium II assay was done using Illumina Sentrix HumanHap300 genotyping BeadChip arrays (317K, TagSNP Phase I, v1.1) according to the manufacturer's specifications (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The EAC biopsies used in this study were collected as part of the Australian Cancer Study.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). EAC samples log_R_ratio values were generated using the squamous sample 192R as a reference. All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Derek,John,Nancarrow!Sample_contact_email = derek.nancarrow@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_phone = 61 7 3362 0323!Sample_contact_fax = 61 7 3845 3508!Sample_contact_laboratory = Oncogenomics!Sample_contact_department = Genetics & Population Health!Sample_contact_institute = Queensland Institute of Medical Research!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Road!Sample_contact_city = Herston!Sample_contact_state = Queensland!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM265nnn/GSM265501/suppl/GSM265501.txt.gz!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM700314!Sample_series_id = GSE10506!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9937674	1.309934	1	0.2967274142066	AB	0.9026175	0.5065728	0.5679102	0.4405523	0.289082384234	BB	0.8676848	0.9937905	1.099793	1	-0.2579127252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9708762	0.4788096	0.9840335	-0.652681322860	AA	0.8808271	0.009391681	0.4391544	0.0002363768	-0.120780698390	AA	0.8797263	0.01519238	1.615322	0	0.1760657138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9782872	1.004509	0.9890357	0.386650781607	AA	0.7622445	0.1314008	0.2360158	0.06734765	-0.9925708146488	BB	0.8135715	0.968272	1.390857	1	-0.02307133156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9911835	2.249816	0.9988338	0.39053376178	BB	0.8811052	0.9583521	0.8023854	0.9905573	0.1502873260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9773479	1.652142	0.9950562	0.3390555128978	BB	0.850426	0.991702	0.9093248	1	-0.1254063156724	AA	0.9236776	0.0134258	2.044908	0	0.57438671283	BB	0.8091115	1	1.303574	1	0.146918944671	AA	0.8078112	0.003148483	3.608748	0	0.3783669240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9826079	1.286942	1	0.3284394239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9900106	1.516232	1	0.6457538248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9854052	0.3392251	0.9921415	-0.3814719278305	BB	0.6793055	0.9892021	1.043212	1	0.3428125!sample_table_end
