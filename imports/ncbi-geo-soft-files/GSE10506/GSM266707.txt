Long-term storage was then at -80Â°C after access RNAlater was removed.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = As per QIAGEN tissue lyser protocol using ALLPREP Kit!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = The Infinium II assay was done using Illumina Sentrix HumanHap300 genotyping BeadChip arrays (317K, TagSNP Phase I, v1.1) according to the manufacturer's specifications (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The EAC biopsies used in this study were collected as part of the Australian Cancer Study.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). EAC samples log_R_ratio values were generated using the squamous sample 192R as a reference. All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Derek,John,Nancarrow!Sample_contact_email = derek.nancarrow@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_phone = 61 7 3362 0323!Sample_contact_fax = 61 7 3845 3508!Sample_contact_laboratory = Oncogenomics!Sample_contact_department = Genetics & Population Health!Sample_contact_institute = Queensland Institute of Medical Research!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Road!Sample_contact_city = Herston!Sample_contact_state = Queensland!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM266nnn/GSM266707/suppl/GSM266707.txt.gz!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM700312!Sample_series_id = GSE10506!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9862276	0.755676	1	-0.4913096142066	AB	0.8221796	0.4354478	0.3640665	0.3717401	-0.333777284234	BB	0.8676848	0.9946895	0.9531802	1	-0.4635527252381	AB	0.8262362	0.5818077	0.3962042	0.4392945	-0.957286422860	AA	0.8808271	0.01637785	0.3467295	0.005920494	-0.464007998390	AA	0.8797263	0.01714671	1.039417	0	-0.4600066138233	BB	0.8618885	0.987546	0.7008705	1	-0.135559681607	AA	0.784545	0.1015081	0.2310414	0.03147591	-1.035842146488	NC	0.1941214	0.6768782	0.8247474	0.6207887	-0.8822301156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9994783	1.791835	1	0.072698326178	BB	0.8811052	0.9650773	0.5002147	0.9999297	-0.5302404260311	BB	0.7870646	0.986869	1.403535	1	0.1141445128978	BB	0.850426	0.9563826	0.7119926	0.9485064	-0.4775259156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01304953	1.018407	0	-0.43121221283	BB	0.8091115	0.9992946	0.8834785	1	-0.414114544671	AA	0.8078112	0.002588372	2.422706	0	-0.1967041240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9833841	0.8945859	1	-0.1958641239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9846334	1.194404	1	0.2946931248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9824539	0.3549555	0.9869015	-0.3140606278305	BB	0.6793055	0.9784822	0.6761924	1	-0.2713461!sample_table_end
