Tumor and constitutional DNAs were mixed and hybridized with Human Cot I DNA (Invitrogen) at 65Â°C for 24 hours. The sandwiched slides were hybridized for 24 hours at 65Â°C with 15 rotations per minute and washed according to the Agilent protocol.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2565BA).!Sample_data_processing = Log ratios were determined with Agilent Feature Extraction software (v 9.1.3.1). Results were visualized and analyzed with Agilentâs CGH Analytics v3.5 software, and copy number aberrations were detected with the Aberration Detection Method 2 (ADM-2) algorithm using a threshold value of 6.0. This threshold value of the altered copy number was determined from the normal variation in the control hybridization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Eric,,Pasmant!Sample_contact_email = eric.pasmant@gmail.com!Sample_contact_department = EA7331!Sample_contact_institute = Paris Descartes University!Sample_contact_address = FacultÃ© de Pharmacie de Paris, 4 avenue de lâObservatoire!Sample_contact_city = Paris!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75006!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM599nnn/GSM599867/suppl/GSM599867_US84600241_251469373428_LUG15.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE24328!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio (Cy5/Cy3) representing tumor/constitutional!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	-2.094702992e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	-2.969645578e-0014	8.253425877e-0025	-9.747097175e-0026	-1.289808902e-0017	5.046385039e-0028	8.323411028e-0029	8.099034805e-00210	3.096244234e-00211	-9.491563500e-00312	-4.751602208e-00213	4.989833762e-00214	2.869927551e-00215	3.047038371e-00216	-4.380901543e-00217	3.034433737e-00218	-4.215908122e-00219	-7.020327647e-00220	2.758815608e-002!sample_table_end
