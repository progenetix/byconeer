Tumor and constitutional DNAs were mixed and hybridized with Human Cot I DNA (Invitrogen) at 65Â°C for 24 hours. The sandwiched slides were hybridized for 24 hours at 65Â°C with 15 rotations per minute and washed according to the Agilent protocol.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2565BA).!Sample_data_processing = Log ratios were determined with Agilent Feature Extraction software (v 9.1.3.1). Results were visualized and analyzed with Agilentâs CGH Analytics v3.5 software, and copy number aberrations were detected with the Aberration Detection Method 2 (ADM-2) algorithm using a threshold value of 6.0. This threshold value of the altered copy number was determined from the normal variation in the control hybridization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Eric,,Pasmant!Sample_contact_email = eric.pasmant@gmail.com!Sample_contact_department = EA7331!Sample_contact_institute = Paris Descartes University!Sample_contact_address = FacultÃ© de Pharmacie de Paris, 4 avenue de lâObservatoire!Sample_contact_city = Paris!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75006!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM599nnn/GSM599868/suppl/GSM599868_US84600241_251469373296_LUG16.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE24328!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio (Cy5/Cy3) representing tumor/constitutional!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	2.571177939e-0022	5.364694186e-0023	0.000000000e+0004	1.051083563e-0015	-2.094148809e-0026	-9.866095318e-0027	9.380921531e-0028	6.466713540e-0029	8.536233051e-00210	-7.061932887e-00211	1.183566124e-00312	6.290254582e-00213	5.868393289e-00214	1.293918830e-00115	4.429860477e-00216	-5.186248983e-00217	-2.300470894e-00218	1.426188079e-00219	-2.775237701e-00220	6.028669961e-002!sample_table_end
