Tumor and constitutional DNAs were mixed and hybridized with Human Cot I DNA (Invitrogen) at 65Â°C for 24 hours. The sandwiched slides were hybridized for 24 hours at 65Â°C with 15 rotations per minute and washed according to the Agilent protocol.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2565BA).!Sample_data_processing = Log ratios were determined with Agilent Feature Extraction software (v 9.1.3.1). Results were visualized and analyzed with Agilentâs CGH Analytics v3.5 software, and copy number aberrations were detected with the Aberration Detection Method 2 (ADM-2) algorithm using a threshold value of 6.0. This threshold value of the altered copy number was determined from the normal variation in the control hybridization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Eric,,Pasmant!Sample_contact_email = eric.pasmant@gmail.com!Sample_contact_department = EA7331!Sample_contact_institute = Paris Descartes University!Sample_contact_address = FacultÃ© de Pharmacie de Paris, 4 avenue de lâObservatoire!Sample_contact_city = Paris!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75006!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM599nnn/GSM599855/suppl/GSM599855_US84600241_251469312873_BOU3.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE24328!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio (Cy5/Cy3) representing tumor/constitutional!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	4.358944804e-0022	0.000000000e+0003	-3.398136370e-0014	4.473866148e-0025	-6.161135230e-0026	-1.022802047e-0017	-1.906518352e-0038	6.628679971e-0029	3.128863895e-00210	-7.382671809e-00211	1.758496988e-00212	-4.433348054e-00313	5.514112558e-00214	-4.840035831e-00215	2.691694075e-00216	-3.768691207e-00217	2.719826849e-00218	-6.153294735e-00119	-6.932039080e-00220	7.012452062e-002!sample_table_end
