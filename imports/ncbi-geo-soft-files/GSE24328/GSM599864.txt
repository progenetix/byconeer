Tumor and constitutional DNAs were mixed and hybridized with Human Cot I DNA (Invitrogen) at 65Â°C for 24 hours. The sandwiched slides were hybridized for 24 hours at 65Â°C with 15 rotations per minute and washed according to the Agilent protocol.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2565BA).!Sample_data_processing = Log ratios were determined with Agilent Feature Extraction software (v 9.1.3.1). Results were visualized and analyzed with Agilentâs CGH Analytics v3.5 software, and copy number aberrations were detected with the Aberration Detection Method 2 (ADM-2) algorithm using a threshold value of 6.0. This threshold value of the altered copy number was determined from the normal variation in the control hybridization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Eric,,Pasmant!Sample_contact_email = eric.pasmant@gmail.com!Sample_contact_department = EA7331!Sample_contact_institute = Paris Descartes University!Sample_contact_address = FacultÃ© de Pharmacie de Paris, 4 avenue de lâObservatoire!Sample_contact_city = Paris!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75006!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM599nnn/GSM599864/suppl/GSM599864_US84600241_251469373295_KET12.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE24328!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio (Cy5/Cy3) representing tumor/constitutional!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	1.312037793e-0012	0.000000000e+0003	-3.098720538e-0014	-3.538250075e-0035	6.451309994e-0026	-2.063570822e-0017	-1.106566331e-0018	-5.853047191e-0029	2.741438560e-00210	8.674125941e-00211	-3.894348426e-00212	-3.859049348e-00213	-1.039532011e-00114	-1.161953119e-00115	-1.154293039e-00116	6.157271991e-00317	-1.176799133e-00118	-7.660328089e-00119	-7.316430538e-00220	-6.036892450e-002!sample_table_end
