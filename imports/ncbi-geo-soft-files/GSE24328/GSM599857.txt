Tumor and constitutional DNAs were mixed and hybridized with Human Cot I DNA (Invitrogen) at 65Â°C for 24 hours. The sandwiched slides were hybridized for 24 hours at 65Â°C with 15 rotations per minute and washed according to the Agilent protocol.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2565BA).!Sample_data_processing = Log ratios were determined with Agilent Feature Extraction software (v 9.1.3.1). Results were visualized and analyzed with Agilentâs CGH Analytics v3.5 software, and copy number aberrations were detected with the Aberration Detection Method 2 (ADM-2) algorithm using a threshold value of 6.0. This threshold value of the altered copy number was determined from the normal variation in the control hybridization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Eric,,Pasmant!Sample_contact_email = eric.pasmant@gmail.com!Sample_contact_department = EA7331!Sample_contact_institute = Paris Descartes University!Sample_contact_address = FacultÃ© de Pharmacie de Paris, 4 avenue de lâObservatoire!Sample_contact_city = Paris!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 75006!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM599nnn/GSM599857/suppl/GSM599857_US84600241_251469312874_COL5.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE24328!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 ratio (Cy5/Cy3) representing tumor/constitutional!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	1.302339928e-0022	-3.476517463e-0013	-5.878307724e-0014	-3.162412623e-0025	-3.060418872e-0026	-9.885675625e-0027	5.022139628e-0028	6.588428698e-0039	5.748197676e-00210	-1.615911093e-00111	2.632270858e-00212	-9.128905387e-00413	2.358520568e-00214	8.564641079e-00215	3.033544701e-00216	-6.605652382e-00217	-1.764692180e-00218	3.867979371e-00319	-7.891714502e-00220	5.669077895e-002!sample_table_end
