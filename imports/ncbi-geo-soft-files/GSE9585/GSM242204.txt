A panel of chips (n = 12)  assayed with germline DNA served as a reference in order to calculate a test/reference ratio.  The ratios were then subject global normalization that assumed that the median copy number is  diploid (2n; log2 Ratio = 0).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Joel,,Greshock!Sample_contact_department = Translational Medicine, Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = GlaxoSmithKline!Sample_contact_address = 2301 Renaissance Blvd.!Sample_contact_city = King of Prussia!Sample_contact_state = PA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 19406!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM242nnn/GSM242204/suppl/GSM242204.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE9585!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2(estimated test/reference intensity ratio)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-4274945	0.323SNP_A-1938722	-0.115SNP_A-1966191	-0.452SNP_A-4268311	0.389SNP_A-1824912	0.319SNP_A-2137254	-0.945SNP_A-2150238	0.212SNP_A-4304307	0.627SNP_A-2179554	0.499SNP_A-2306754	0.224SNP_A-4254979	0.182SNP_A-2077195	0.235SNP_A-1835428	-0.045SNP_A-2205551	-0.555SNP_A-2056347	-0.170SNP_A-2130509	-0.167SNP_A-1958474	0.640SNP_A-1804786	-0.568SNP_A-4269169	0.448SNP_A-4258844	-0.186!sample_table_end
