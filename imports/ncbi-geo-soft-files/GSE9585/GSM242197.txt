A panel of chips (n = 12)  assayed with germline DNA served as a reference in order to calculate a test/reference ratio.  The ratios were then subject global normalization that assumed that the median copy number is  diploid (2n; log2 Ratio = 0).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Joel,,Greshock!Sample_contact_department = Translational Medicine, Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = GlaxoSmithKline!Sample_contact_address = 2301 Renaissance Blvd.!Sample_contact_city = King of Prussia!Sample_contact_state = PA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 19406!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM242nnn/GSM242197/suppl/GSM242197.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE9585!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2(estimated test/reference intensity ratio)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-4274945	0.338SNP_A-1938722	0.053SNP_A-1966191	0.622SNP_A-4268311	-0.124SNP_A-1824912	-0.224SNP_A-2137254	1.320SNP_A-2150238	-0.246SNP_A-4304307	0.733SNP_A-2179554	0.263SNP_A-2306754	0.280SNP_A-4254979	-0.242SNP_A-2077195	1.045SNP_A-1835428	0.153SNP_A-2205551	-0.552SNP_A-2056347	-0.120SNP_A-2130509	-1.200SNP_A-1958474	0.279SNP_A-1804786	-0.179SNP_A-4269169	0.483SNP_A-4258844	-0.244!sample_table_end
