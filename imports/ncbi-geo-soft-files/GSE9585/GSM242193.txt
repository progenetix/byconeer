A panel of chips (n = 12)  assayed with germline DNA served as a reference in order to calculate a test/reference ratio.  The ratios were then subject global normalization that assumed that the median copy number is  diploid (2n; log2 Ratio = 0).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Joel,,Greshock!Sample_contact_department = Translational Medicine, Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = GlaxoSmithKline!Sample_contact_address = 2301 Renaissance Blvd.!Sample_contact_city = King of Prussia!Sample_contact_state = PA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 19406!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM242nnn/GSM242193/suppl/GSM242193.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE9585!Sample_data_row_count = 262338#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2(estimated test/reference intensity ratio)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1794317	-0.216SNP_A-1786243	0.047SNP_A-1967971	0.387SNP_A-1791488	0.036SNP_A-1798049	0.180SNP_A-2138981	-0.548SNP_A-2308310	-0.055SNP_A-1976263	-0.419SNP_A-1784239	-0.163SNP_A-1898104	-0.163SNP_A-4212440	-0.187SNP_A-2094651	-0.299SNP_A-2107677	-0.175SNP_A-2071979	-0.130SNP_A-2029699	0.232SNP_A-2260858	-0.212SNP_A-4203142	-0.022SNP_A-2154361	-0.624SNP_A-2118532	0.012SNP_A-1980258	-1.350!sample_table_end
