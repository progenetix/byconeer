A panel of chips (n = 12)  assayed with germline DNA served as a reference in order to calculate a test/reference ratio.  The ratios were then subject global normalization that assumed that the median copy number is  diploid (2n; log2 Ratio = 0).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Joel,,Greshock!Sample_contact_department = Translational Medicine, Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = GlaxoSmithKline!Sample_contact_address = 2301 Renaissance Blvd.!Sample_contact_city = King of Prussia!Sample_contact_state = PA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 19406!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM242nnn/GSM242189/suppl/GSM242189.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE9585!Sample_data_row_count = 262338#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2(estimated test/reference intensity ratio)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1794317	-0.028SNP_A-1786243	0.284SNP_A-1967971	0.479SNP_A-1791488	-0.024SNP_A-1798049	0.853SNP_A-2138981	0.207SNP_A-2308310	0.018SNP_A-1976263	-0.291SNP_A-1784239	-0.016SNP_A-1898104	-0.420SNP_A-4212440	-0.186SNP_A-2094651	-0.369SNP_A-2107677	-0.130SNP_A-2071979	-0.091SNP_A-2029699	0.582SNP_A-2260858	-0.336SNP_A-4203142	-0.031SNP_A-2154361	-0.175SNP_A-2118532	-0.066SNP_A-1980258	0.185!sample_table_end
