KG) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. DNA quality and concentration were evaluated using spectrophotometer NANODROP 1000 ( Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc.).!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Agilent Genomic DNA Labelling kit, Direct Method, as described by the manufacturer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA).  1ug template!Sample_source_name_ch2 = reference control!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = gender: female!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = phenotype: normal pooled!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue: peripheral blood!Sample_biomaterial_provider_ch2 = Roswell Park Cancer Institute!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen FlexiGene DNA kit protocol (Cat# 51206).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Agilent Genomic DNA Labelling kit, Direct Method, as described by the manufacturer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA).  1ug template!Sample_hyb_protocol = 1Î¼g of reference and test sample genomic DNA were individually fluorescently labeled using the Agilent Genomic DNA Labeling kit, Direct Method, as described by the manufacturer (Agilent Technologies).  Initially, the DNA is denatured in the presence of the random primer at 95ËC for 3 minutes in a thermalcycler, and then quickly cooled to 4ËC.  The tubes are transferred to ice and labeling occurs with the addition of dUTP-cyanine 3 mix (or dUTP-cyanine 5) and Exo-Klenow fragment.  Incubation takes place for two hours at 37ËC in a thermalcycler.  After purification, the labeled DNA is combined and resuspended in 50Î¼g Cot-1 DNA, and 1x Agilent blocking agent and hybridization buffer.  The entire sample is heated to 95ËC for 3 minutes followed by a 37ËC incubation for 30 minutes.  Hybridization to the Agilent human 244K CGH array was performed for 40 hours at 65ËC using a rotating hybridization oven.  Arrays were washed according to the manufacturerâs recommendations; air dried, and scanned using an Agilent DNA microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies, Inc), and processed using Agilentâs Feature Extraction software.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned using an Agilent 2565AA DNA microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies, Inc) to generate high-resolution (5 Î¼m) images for both Cy3 (control) and Cy5 (test) channels.  !Sample_description = Image analysis was performed using the Feature Extraction version 9.5.1.1 (Agilent Technologies) and the Agilentâs CGH-v4_95_Feb07 protocol. !Sample_data_processing = Data was processed from Agilentâs Feature Extraction output by CGH Analytics version 3.4.27 (Agilent Technologies).  Aberration calls were made using Agilentâs ADM-1 algorithm with a threshold of 10, comparing the Kasumi-1 DNA sample versus the control DNA sample.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4091!Sample_contact_name = Jeffrey,,Conroy!Sample_contact_email = jeffrey.conroy@roswellpark.org!Sample_contact_institute = Roswell Park Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = Elm & Carlton Sts!Sample_contact_city = Buffalo!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14263!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM506nnn/GSM506744/suppl/GSM506744_US45102899_251469321026_S01_CGH_v4_95_Feb07.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20239!Sample_data_row_count = 243430#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log10 (test/control)#gProcessedSignal = green channel (control) processed signal#rProcessedSignal = red channel (test) processed signal#gMeanSignal = green channel (control) mean signal#rMeanSignal = red channel (test) mean signal!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	gProcessedSignal	rProcessedSignal	gMeanSignal	rMeanSignal1	-1.53E-02	2.08E+03	2.01E+03	1.48E+02	1.73E+022	-9.80E-01	3.64E+02	3.81E+01	9.26E+01	6.46E+013	-7.77E-01	2.50E+02	4.19E+01	8.89E+01	6.75E+014	6.35E-02	7.07E+02	8.18E+02	1.04E+02	1.10E+025	-6.65E-02	9.70E+02	8.32E+02	1.12E+02	1.10E+026	-4.53E-01	1.40E+03	4.93E+02	1.26E+02	9.20E+017	1.46E-01	1.58E+03	2.21E+03	1.32E+02	1.86E+028	-1.06E-02	1.03E+03	1.00E+03	1.14E+02	1.20E+029	1.03E-01	1.45E+03	1.84E+03	1.27E+02	1.66E+0210	-7.64E-01	5.66E+02	9.74E+01	9.91E+01	7.06E+0111	-5.68E-04	1.56E+03	1.56E+03	1.31E+02	1.51E+0212	-6.63E-03	1.01E+03	9.96E+02	1.13E+02	1.20E+0213	-6.69E-03	1.57E+03	1.54E+03	1.31E+02	1.50E+0214	1.39E-02	1.42E+03	1.46E+03	1.27E+02	1.46E+0215	-3.10E-02	1.68E+03	1.56E+03	1.35E+02	1.52E+0216	-1.31E-01	1.06E+03	7.86E+02	1.15E+02	1.09E+0217	2.40E-02	1.52E+03	1.60E+03	1.30E+02	1.54E+0218	-5.17E-01	3.30E+02	1.00E+02	9.16E+01	7.09E+0119	-9.44E-02	4.00E+02	3.22E+02	9.39E+01	8.33E+0120	-9.03E-02	7.45E+02	6.05E+02	1.05E+02	9.92E+01!sample_table_end
