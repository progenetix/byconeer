Copy number values for individual SNPs were extracted and converted from CEL files into signal intensities using GTYPE 4.0 and Copy Number Analyzer for Affymetrix GeneChip mapping (CNAGT 2.0) software. The inferred copy number states were derived from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based algorithm implemented in CNAG2.0. Regions of homozygosity (LCSH/LOH) were determined with a likelihood based algorithm implemented in CNAG2.0.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Rolph,,Pfundt!Sample_contact_email = Rolph.Pfundt@radboudumc.nl!Sample_contact_laboratory = Genome Diagnostics!Sample_contact_department = Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = RUNMC!Sample_contact_address = Geert Grooteplein Zuid 6!Sample_contact_city = Nijmegen!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 6525GA!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM992nnn/GSM992930/suppl/GSM992930_PN11-0204.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM992nnn/GSM992930/suppl/GSM992930_PN11-0204.CHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE40405!Sample_data_row_count = 262338#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotypes: AA, AB, BB, No Call#CONFIDENCE = #RAS1 = Relative allele signal for the data in the first probe group#RAS2 = Relative allele signal for the data in the second probe group#P-VALUE AA = #P-VALUE AB = #P-VALUE BB = #P-VALUE NO CALL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	RAS1	RAS2	P-VALUE AA	P-VALUE AB	P-VALUE BB	P-VALUE NO CALLAFFX-5Q-123	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-456	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-789	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-5Q-ABC	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeA	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeB	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeC	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeD	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeE	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeF	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeG	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeH	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeI	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeJ	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeK	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeL	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeM	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeN	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeO	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0AFFX-barcodeP	No Call	0	0	0	0	0	0	0!sample_table_end
