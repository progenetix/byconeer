Labeled DNA was purified using PureLink PCR Purification Kit (Invitrogen).!Sample_hyb_protocol = Prior to hybridization, sample DNA and reference DNA were pooled with 100 ug human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen). Following the Pronto Universal Hybridization System (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) BAC arrays were hybridized for 48 hrs at 37 degrees using the MAUIÂ® Hybridization System (BioMicro system Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA).!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were scanned with an Agilent Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies).!Sample_description = Analysis used male reference DNA to investigate the genomic alterations appearing in sporadic MMR procifient tumors!Sample_description = The dye information in the .gpr files represent the compound used to label the tumor sample.!Sample_data_processing = Images were processed using the GenePix Pro.4.1 software (Axon Instruments INC., Foster City, CA, USA). The output of GenePix were uploaded in the in-house develeoped web-based BioArray Software Environment (BASE, http://base.onk.lu.se). Median spot pixel values were used to calculate background corrected intensities and spots were considered missing if they were flagged or had a signal-to-noise ratio <3. Spots from dye-swap hybridization were merged using geometric mean of ratios and the log2 transformed and normalized (LOWESS) values were plotted against their genomic location.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Therkildsen!Sample_contact_laboratory = Clinical Research Centre!Sample_contact_department = Clinical Research Centre!Sample_contact_institute = Copenhagen University Hospital!Sample_contact_address = Kettegaard Alle 30!Sample_contact_city = Hvidovre!Sample_contact_state = Hvidovre!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 2650!Sample_contact_country = Denmark!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM941nnn/GSM941638/suppl/GSM941638_AS35_Cy3_13852549.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM941nnn/GSM941638/suppl/GSM941638_AS35_Cy5_13852550.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38405!Sample_data_row_count = 31811#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference male DNA).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE24210	0.0507645333690	1.11637573269	-0.1804287930616	-0.044202118378	-0.0740452268901	0.2195063725826	-0.8472463069	0.2264720218650	0.0646151621308	-0.4149142515476	0.12232058512896	0.2903361611475	-0.143984699644	0.181667451410	-0.7558738618734	0.01567893826813	0.5603391518245	-0.5569842515734	0.15392916982	-0.31949604!sample_table_end
