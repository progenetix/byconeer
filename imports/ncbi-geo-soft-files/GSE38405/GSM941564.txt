Labeled DNA was purified using PureLink PCR Purification Kit (Invitrogen).!Sample_hyb_protocol = Prior to hybridization, sample DNA and reference DNA were pooled with 100 ug human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen). Following the Pronto Universal Hybridization System (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) BAC arrays were hybridized for 48 hrs at 37 degrees using the MAUIÂ® Hybridization System (BioMicro system Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA).!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were scanned with an Agilent Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies).!Sample_description = Analysis used male reference DNA to investigate the genomic alterations appearing in Lynch syndrome tumors!Sample_description = The dye information in the .gpr files represent the compound used to label the tumor sample.!Sample_data_processing = Images were processed using the GenePix Pro.4.1 software (Axon Instruments INC., Foster City, CA, USA). The output of GenePix were uploaded in the in-house develeoped web-based BioArray Software Environment (BASE, http://base.onk.lu.se). Median spot pixel values were used to calculate background corrected intensities and spots were considered missing if they were flagged or had a signal-to-noise ratio <3. Spots from dye-swap hybridization were merged using geometric mean of ratios and the log2 transformed and normalized (LOWESS) values were plotted against their genomic location.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Therkildsen!Sample_contact_laboratory = Clinical Research Centre!Sample_contact_department = Clinical Research Centre!Sample_contact_institute = Copenhagen University Hospital!Sample_contact_address = Kettegaard Alle 30!Sample_contact_city = Hvidovre!Sample_contact_state = Hvidovre!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 2650!Sample_contact_country = Denmark!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM941nnn/GSM941564/suppl/GSM941564_AH77_Cy3_13886055.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM941nnn/GSM941564/suppl/GSM941564_AH77_Cy5_13885954.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38405!Sample_data_row_count = 31811#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference male DNA).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE24210	0.2667079333690	0.54856753269	0.1755204630616	-0.318062718378	-0.268902278901	0.4973614225826	-0.058297463069	0.4797293218650	1.096647321308	1.109931615476	1.748325712896	0.3961756811475	-3.79E-049644	1.30591991410	-0.2651348418734	0.454980126813	1.190377418245	-0.611949115734	0.277409736982	-0.5151346!sample_table_end
