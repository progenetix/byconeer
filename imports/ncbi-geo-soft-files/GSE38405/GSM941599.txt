Labeled DNA was purified using PureLink PCR Purification Kit (Invitrogen).!Sample_hyb_protocol = Prior to hybridization, sample DNA and reference DNA were pooled with 100 ug human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen). Following the Pronto Universal Hybridization System (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) BAC arrays were hybridized for 48 hrs at 37 degrees using the MAUIÂ® Hybridization System (BioMicro system Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA).!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were scanned with an Agilent Microarray Scanner (Agilent Technologies).!Sample_description = Analysis used male reference DNA to investigate the genomic alterations appearing in FCCTX tumors!Sample_description = The dye information in the .gpr files represent the compound used to label the tumor sample.!Sample_data_processing = Images were processed using the GenePix Pro.4.1 software (Axon Instruments INC., Foster City, CA, USA). The output of GenePix were uploaded in the in-house develeoped web-based BioArray Software Environment (BASE, http://base.onk.lu.se). Median spot pixel values were used to calculate background corrected intensities and spots were considered missing if they were flagged or had a signal-to-noise ratio <3. Spots from dye-swap hybridization were merged using geometric mean of ratios and the log2 transformed and normalized (LOWESS) values were plotted against their genomic location.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Christina,,Therkildsen!Sample_contact_laboratory = Clinical Research Centre!Sample_contact_department = Clinical Research Centre!Sample_contact_institute = Copenhagen University Hospital!Sample_contact_address = Kettegaard Alle 30!Sample_contact_city = Hvidovre!Sample_contact_state = Hvidovre!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 2650!Sample_contact_country = Denmark!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM941nnn/GSM941599/suppl/GSM941599_AA66_Cy3_13904104.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM941nnn/GSM941599/suppl/GSM941599_AA66_Cy5_13904105.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE38405!Sample_data_row_count = 31811#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference male DNA).!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE24210	-0.187613433690	1.05906163269	-0.0352818430616	-0.607688218378	-0.160122898901	0.826771925826	-0.56938683069	0.4834027618650	0.527505521308	1.053898215476	1.42299712896	0.2156320811475	0.842400139644	1.31666531410	-0.1891624618734	0.618213926813	1.746192918245	-0.9413028415734	-0.0115314816982	-0.69337505!sample_table_end
