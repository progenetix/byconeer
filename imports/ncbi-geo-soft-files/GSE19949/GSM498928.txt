Probes are mapped by their position in genome build 36 / HG18. Probes are ordered according to their linear position on the Golden Path.!Sample_data_processing = CEL files were processed with R using the aroma.affymetrix package. Background correction was done using the CRMAv2 method (Bengtstroem et al.). Segmentation was done using the circular binary segmentation (CBS) method. Post-segmentation thresholding & visualization were done using tools implemented through the Progenetix project (www.progenetix.net). For detection of small regional CNAs, adaptive thresholding was used, with a 100-300kb size filter and +/-0.13-0.15 thresholds on the segmentation data.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Michael,,Baudis!Sample_contact_email = mbaudis@gmail.com!Sample_contact_department = Institute of Molecular Life Sciences!Sample_contact_institute = University of Zurich!Sample_contact_address = Winterthurerstrasse 190!Sample_contact_city = Zurich!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8057!Sample_contact_country = Switzerland!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM498nnn/GSM498928/suppl/GSM498928_UZHRCC191,GenomeWideSNP_6,CN,raw.csv.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM498nnn/GSM498928/suppl/GSM498928_UZHRCC191,GenomeWideSNP_6,segments.csv.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM498nnn/GSM498928/suppl/GSM498928_UZHRCC191,GenomeWideSNP_6.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19949!Sample_data_row_count = 0
