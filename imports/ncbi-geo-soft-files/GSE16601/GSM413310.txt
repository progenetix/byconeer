Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413310/suppl/GSM413310_NN516.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413310/suppl/GSM413310_NN517.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16601!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2706.1616064598588	3646.0743831831846	3345.2297064355143	2858.9627516407832	1.314242500555534	1.248831722264216	1.0523775758776559	-0.1858	0.879144088234554592	4303.0044165400986	4841.1099616327019	5034.2626058584374	3831.7323382806803	2.1805019058024966	1.8248606183499283	1.1948868225202567	0.2067	1.15407817012484263	1267.3916007050223	1211.5547211865005	1668.8967532472889	992.12010110288486	0.74479888631998326	0.47337200469672785	1.5733902278339182	0.3172	1.2458703072864334	13394.654095010465	16226.461303688895	13547.021356980757	12727.70834641972	5.4748270612813004	5.2553112647389719	1.0417702749626256	-0.1261	0.916293931946812525	11556.051827842935	19705.253035349258	11946.667808836533	15364.176431470614	5.8969500805446042	7.498963310837425	0.78636870672808767	-0.3786	0.769162086456211986	3991.0105778261513	7622.6179937809666	4710.2562768014332	6098.6208126701904	1.9371143200893597	2.7731171801072434	0.69853316476675076	-0.2161	0.860899067522893917	1052.1224160049344	1837.8307695634794	1390.0161985148104	1450.1925339840627	0.56307404621050883	0.58572191458116263	0.96133341128810434	0.1588	1.11637469994904638	1069.1428017295234	2591.2697769281917	1421.4603880935754	2016.2643684031614	0.56951158832327586	0.88996467643240651	0.63992605931987301	-0.2968	0.814080190275131019	2180.5298605673488	4338.8889918009409	2752.0120451429921	3416.3401344482186	1.226878645070953	1.5346758955398085	0.79943827138785506	-0.4821	0.7159135978657127410	6342.0233081000624	11287.36345788733	7090.8767632507715	9017.6115748057127	2.8421293492025179	3.8502672349901412	0.7381641781573105	-0.3903	0.7629491911042857211	6437.0530422171087	11224.696406766248	7183.3123540293645	8954.6513399585092	3.4323306734098731	3.7084141554603147	0.92555214426524279	0.0322	1.022575132277730612	8170.8877471945634	7288.1531150436113	8841.20508969408	5827.8919835205825	4.0894877932133227	2.3975339062552909	1.7057059266372154	0.2827	1.216449877094879113	1520.408190395495	2524.2025131999512	1977.1500844402897	1966.5403395618414	1.1451552771186375	1.1180415550222991	1.0242510861734451	-0.1491	0.9017986135798933314	7485.5531213088734	11938.57341744382	8181.048545206153	9519.0861865355182	3.4266255105956738	4.069971875898224	0.84192854768546321	-0.0517	0.9648157775358510215	2036.0815978919272	2590.8671490138458	2589.1331493146008	2019.3890302763348	0.95512359239542233	0.82820046473679898	1.153251698185124	0.0259	1.018116801242284516	1300.6044511707714	1925.4014379253879	1703.6879551699828	1515.9940943491376	0.75794694636021376	0.68944976868878294	1.0993504977189286	0.1787	1.131824614631850917	330.38188505644405	318.90875405508035	329.26584475830475	337.94748719883273	0.2002216289441443	0.20811250329434811	0.96208361234767703	0.0051	1.003508569201449218	2097.8718914616065	3822.3090315825616	2652.7811068872152	2997.6187759585946	1.230284384885493	1.4038149056434199	0.87638646657737851	-0.0642	0.9564644325078572919	1634.2597129006581	1906.534600507943	2117.05523621165	1501.6030207700044	0.83705479587770037	0.61162121519825507	1.3685836512495266	0.1406	1.102394386308131820	1552.0677782548464	2227.643320262795	2017.6889893087293	1744.8600257130788	0.89899599541469022	0.74771657487943566	1.2023218765207224	-0.1034	0.93086060716124608!sample_table_end
