Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413309/suppl/GSM413309_NN514.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413309/suppl/GSM413309_NN515.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16601!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3276.5145037628836	2921.3469393062919	3255.9141006731966	2829.1807530075939	1.7328508610062487	1.6177725806460697	1.0711337809386172	-0.1108	0.926090681789581762	2506.9175774862347	2167.8983347844082	2516.8315506154627	2120.3588454015116	1.5597485865498875	1.3194589931311651	1.1821122101328052	0.1010	1.07252326033576483	1979.269057173796	1710.5646700977206	2004.9580465498809	1687.5272058492042	1.2362384939063396	1.0677208729083136	1.1578292841077544	0.1324	1.09609530128164484	4752.5317297069296	5315.2252709332388	4653.9540885366559	5050.8089405006403	2.4115710726618316	2.7436830914408965	0.8789539433999829	-0.2158	0.861070266656287055	6936.442735789492	9108.2672370198288	6736.0690049962368	8551.4438511994285	4.2255149225386441	5.3713973560121469	0.78666958381119778	-0.3722	0.772602956064278766	3672.0869350335092	3521.4570643172628	3633.3892047435229	3388.6336077659698	2.1790244496702393	2.0695723122653917	1.0528863556765693	0.0401	1.02818355389171267	1203.6169520350675	1047.3479118584005	1232.6799049504739	1055.6520831759692	0.57070511499130794	0.54419806156991946	1.0487084671799822	0.3254	1.25304752746045368	965.42308738589259	1111.9251648614227	991.8490634470038	1116.9269687071203	0.57885853886906657	0.67466572366760624	0.85799310467750733	-0.1355	0.910365633069122229	2408.3018391089531	3132.9411832495066	2422.9317432467524	3027.4457551013434	1.3427603322932939	1.7405003599512296	0.77147949129462934	-0.1792	0.8832022469677658410	4880.3016406249135	6730.1270688804407	4774.6901287572118	6345.5111679249985	2.5567931904377845	3.5292867860478969	0.7244503905280214	-0.1744	0.8861598260895141611	18067.513858574468	18958.274383319265	18554.711993292909	17575.974750789788	9.8508586441224022	9.4797626943313364	1.0391461222982898	-0.0546	0.9628712258426893612	4823.7353734531007	3572.2648119051028	4721.0641776882139	3434.7692839746464	2.4693453509490109	1.9073532498237999	1.2946450014841917	0.2692	1.205107454746133613	2236.2441827389353	2557.7995617066372	2259.7483847102185	2488.9116873013209	1.1758779539426811	1.3815884500027991	0.85110580791284041	-0.0845	0.9431306889818420514	6170.5654682001377	6855.4704091563053	5996.1795961371818	6459.9721107180221	3.0336713203388537	3.4723155909611267	0.87367384699590112	-0.1121	0.9252364251726691315	2522.9321937570571	3213.0662051107292	2533.5689096594306	3102.3578788610666	1.3181069770781404	1.7492509201698918	0.75352653063067843	-0.1471	0.903068038911700416	1699.9422550477011	2159.4995940080144	1727.8800324326573	2113.0495862142448	0.90918124206946971	1.1555797538981931	0.78677498372783761	0.0328	1.022978702399551417	682.04105096530452	728.46928802471564	692.62433444196552	749.79608499016399	0.59015477421939255	0.60605391629583028	0.97376612600144141	-0.0183	0.9873932901628177418	2711.7968730541097	3020.26144662768	2709.5882982818857	2921.5344087479079	1.6474921567490199	1.8124252852601637	0.9089986606054945	0.0049	1.003385480008698319	2260.8557429472698	2171.9384392639085	2283.5883938259162	2125.184585163885	1.1839410578193477	1.1839671684101531	0.99997794652461458	0.0529	1.037367116044686720	1219.9903829111859	1209.967561293741	1249.0880874305105	1210.7614588344463	0.70212238075880773	0.69234556347588128	1.0141212969342108	-0.2020	0.86937192783914674!sample_table_end
