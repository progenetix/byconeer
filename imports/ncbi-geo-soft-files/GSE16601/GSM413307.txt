Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413307/suppl/GSM413307_NN510.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413307/suppl/GSM413307_NN511.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16601!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2491.9104239254498	3143.6017651413677	2819.6236750810922	2666.8967302504134	1.5334232158493768	1.5262497944361488	1.0047000310430036	-0.0640	0.956609362202296982	2359.5197176578558	3328.2674571194475	2678.3210647670785	2826.7221509796623	1.3265427001137864	1.6096707169993965	0.8241081148488606	-0.0217	0.985078661578120413	1750.4528698971458	1773.5941919201455	2023.7186189435017	1508.5058779996539	1.0774226130842099	0.88965588941516194	1.2110554495317074	0.2175	1.16273475390511144	4142.5663423545375	5638.2369941840188	4559.1396291396995	4776.8512531336828	2.6894549943739228	2.5407145936237012	1.058542742708491	-0.0341	0.976611354319715695	9057.7093731390487	10829.13069201018	9827.7567669230739	9090.0126917669804	5.7923386742423153	5.7963878032424132	0.99930143925190185	-0.0033	0.997688584715052846	4837.824546298335	6079.0518734282959	5299.2621159380469	5142.8624233173095	2.8066566681327978	2.967328995319702	0.9458528773046978	0.0484	1.03409131310462997	908.8692235869745	1439.6399691600113	1102.7641605793856	1229.029575624641	0.64274937890928718	0.68672217022994431	0.93596713019191868	0.0647	1.04588548395270998	1146.3868341785676	1542.636397301153	1368.3831253264968	1314.8310798801408	0.73570533754665568	0.76069394406516178	0.96715024917252979	-0.0575	0.960941189428773169	1892.3698572947428	3624.1355092618428	2177.8993697181013	3074.8659574307208	1.4192157796138225	1.9852259220200021	0.71488880125529775	-0.2586	0.8358720359782140210	4564.0529958383722	7975.070730628624	4987.1806354406535	6715.3177364033645	2.7857308647193255	3.7053715863658017	0.75180877269357693	-0.1054	0.9295498981297701811	7516.1809591375322	14049.23599546681	8193.1057462074896	11737.579197626639	6.5601822621323551	7.7118580073524425	0.85066170252070483	-0.0456	0.9688740821844189512	3944.8572446514831	3545.8395637492886	4346.9529431916044	3008.6616998143122	2.8423102109436935	1.655114990720338	1.7172886638569234	0.3010	1.232036767974650913	1924.7051870824164	2877.6786817302586	2214.7877496239703	2443.5261282887659	1.1312342335594197	1.3462663601609999	0.84027519890204749	-0.0495	0.966256322163795214	5079.0183294123726	6744.3745738272619	5535.0233604777413	5697.1307661538995	2.9794541977628861	2.8850037576580094	1.0327384114679801	0.0162	1.011310765683413315	1999.6985431215053	2617.4724185089876	2293.0853264640086	2222.5660367869905	1.1917530927953504	1.2158475009080918	0.98018303438980148	-0.0050	0.9965390392115043316	1192.7085458403267	2021.8887621215531	1420.4626703478837	1717.5472006025125	0.89457816449923733	1.0463114853244584	0.85498264813735758	-0.0594	0.9596527014403303217	447.75367683534529	586.02864690986701	564.01285700592246	515.48452990802423	0.37929123920593744	0.36967657971756496	1.0260083002707883	0.0576	1.040757756107375118	2226.887722075342	3095.835743784321	2536.2387057770879	2629.5725109719006	1.5188520245564026	1.494884320441364	1.0160331497141946	-0.0671	0.954555829503428119	1592.2593346487338	2147.5447959542112	1857.6994117599859	1824.6909022906937	0.97566705354631411	1.0236810012464774	0.95309676780002794	-0.0230	0.9841848925342460120	947.99018596878227	1212.9139792693957	1147.5200555877313	1037.144953673072	0.75542301870436157	0.71861877357023252	1.0512152569453184	-0.1302	0.9136765762204091!sample_table_end
