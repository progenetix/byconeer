Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413308/suppl/GSM413308_NN512.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413308/suppl/GSM413308_NN513.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16601!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3031.5249537325408	3173.7773604338699	3262.5805399710666	2892.0223275763501	1.8535907109576044	1.7460488943331485	1.0615915264306091	-0.0451	0.969235776394993812	1960.5859740305889	2319.3692723509689	2108.786033989843	2138.8410886108782	1.3615734191610191	1.4436111017753501	0.94317189545477931	-0.0725	0.950984453983368733	1805.7314287463182	1548.3789359501986	1944.1872293979827	1449.9178593657434	1.1067100717416722	0.87541101925517328	1.264217661645721	0.1920	1.14234125225773724	6006.684084931152	5527.0394572429886	6524.2456155909595	4921.3914676795894	2.9425277481213161	2.306978252691771	1.2754900245323029	0.1965	1.14588340341465265	8700.8195852836579	8581.7667390693987	9550.9445308344966	7539.5729263398989	6.5795333496647501	5.1032565674883532	1.289281317263453	0.2110	1.15749974664100466	4408.5463817272293	5728.0292747966132	4760.9549393582402	5097.5131561287062	2.7619323691812014	3.0274342654214181	0.91230135059488759	-0.0550	0.962604391894638987	989.76023839161599	1187.6273987573848	1065.9633984895715	1124.7170745363953	0.44672285158076935	0.55649729454489005	0.80274038339414466	0.0909	1.06501124801538178	879.75245226015966	1173.9661891244032	946.44952200834246	1111.7563186641482	0.56663402878324731	0.68385817771651947	0.82858412350248278	-0.1443	0.904832812211081699	3069.6958471942721	3925.0949255276041	3303.0223221678084	3546.8562236840971	1.8643289970422754	2.064974591190833	0.90283386778485797	-0.0153	0.9894474004130405810	7241.4382510586711	10874.175914337682	7904.4683061979986	9492.0921973596687	3.672889911411406	4.6426182646814986	0.79112468482553144	-0.0776	0.9476050185906826911	13672.241382229786	21447.668443371302	15198.706677781365	18625.361337688741	7.8864531387999914	9.4721089466910833	0.83259738493136604	-0.2129	0.8628117991724035812	4370.8376500521044	3863.0036643819103	4712.4668841919092	3494.3232973851113	2.1817008005519316	1.5823246880272805	1.3787946412388385	0.2756	1.210493849175566613	2502.2519445150697	3385.8676166457153	2691.2902586391087	3077.8937052808428	1.2252285033247681	1.4948430787720728	0.8196368707351025	-0.1060	0.9291738263430906514	7095.8382974115111	7679.6235570696736	7740.373912936996	6756.04835787298	3.6732675793261738	3.2431928150828351	1.1326084475283822	0.0332	1.023269103142576215	2774.1030549152374	2941.2203978081675	2984.3756446909279	2686.6906499054016	1.5953434735445111	1.5518501740952815	1.0280267387762392	0.2160	1.161540906026059116	1544.3996541032004	2326.1040988063319	1662.8297476237126	2143.8865068592836	0.92552092463141455	1.2154316499692086	0.76147508965630561	-0.1212	0.9194360318055565517	438.46569180233814	526.27707158713019	460.67840883638786	518.11250188963493	0.39217446457105221	0.40916750547213632	0.95846923161340492	-0.0330	0.9773799197212956818	2636.2606808692904	3516.088037310662	2835.8286171874115	3191.1600812016195	1.6209618531860577	1.7715955460753687	0.91497286543589962	-0.0610	0.9586173155662903719	2066.1130289776365	2444.0984668380065	2224.5174586791709	2247.9568450301854	1.257681993564014	1.3009311005595159	0.96675526707225234	-0.0367	0.9748950701716446720	905.5749485405305	1063.634130394564	975.53840202724393	1011.2542021867965	0.62707972269096635	0.64919370264283183	0.96593623773329795	-0.1791	0.88325041658621595!sample_table_end
