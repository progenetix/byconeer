Spots were excluded with quality flag < 1 or confidence value < 0.85. Triplicates of the spot ratios (Cy3/Cy5 intensity signals) were fused within BlueFuse in a confidence weighted fashion. The resulting log2 transformed ratios were normalized to their mode value.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2843!Sample_contact_name = Philip,C,De Witt Hamer!Sample_contact_email = P.C.DeWittHamer@amc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 5663542!Sample_contact_fax = +31 20 5669590!Sample_contact_department = Neurosurgery!Sample_contact_institute = Academic Medical Center Amsterdam!Sample_contact_address = PO Box 22660!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1100 DD!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM140nnn/GSM140162/suppl/GSM140162.xls.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE6042!Sample_data_row_count = 19200
