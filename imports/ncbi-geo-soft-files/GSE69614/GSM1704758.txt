Subsequent data analysis was performed using PartekÂ® Genomics SuiteÂ® software v. 6.6 (Partek, St. Louis, MI, USA) starting from CEL files. Considering the use of FFPE specimens and to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, probe sets from fragments longer than 700Â bp were removed from further analysis (as recommended by PartekÂ®). CN values were generated from the allele intensities using the PartekÂ® 380-sample HapMap reference (run by Affymetrix) for unpaired samples. Starting with CN estimates for each marker, a list of regions was identified using genomic segmentation. This algorithm identified breakpoints, which represented changes in CN between adjacent regions. For the identification of different regions, a minimum of 50 genomic markers had to be included within a region and a t-test p-value threshold of 0.001 was applied. After genomic segmentation, the dataset was separated into different groups: (i) MUMs only, (ii) matched PUM-MUM pairs, and (iii) PUMs only, whereby the final dataset of (iii) functioned as a reference for comparisons to the MUMs. These individual worksheets were filtered further to identify regions, which showed either only amplifications or only deletions within the samples for individual regions. This step was included not only to minimize the output amount, but mainly because we hypothesized that only non-contradicting alterations would lead to meaningful data. Genes overlapping the regions were identified and annotated with the NCBI Reference Sequence (RefSeq, released 02.02.2015) database. Venn diagrams were used to identify genes with common aberrations as well as genes specifically amplified or deleted in both primary and metastatic tumors. For the AsCN analysis, the AsCN workflow was used. In brief, the intensity (CEL) and genotype (CHP) files were uploaded and the AsCN was created using the unpaired analysis. AI was calculated and overlapped with the CN regions determined using the CN analysis workflow. Finally, the overlapping genes were identified and annotated with the NCBI RefSeq.!Sample_data_processing = Genotype Call (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; 'Signal' = Summarized signal!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sarah,E,Coupland!Sample_contact_email = s.e.coupland@liverpool.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Liverpool Ocular Oncology Research Group!Sample_contact_department = Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine!Sample_contact_institute = University of Liverpool!Sample_contact_address = 6th Floor Duncan Building, Daulby Street!Sample_contact_city = Liverpool!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = L69 3GA!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1704nnn/GSM1704758/suppl/GSM1704758_PUM09.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1704nnn/GSM1704758/suppl/GSM1704758_PUM09.chp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE69614!Sample_data_row_count = 909622
