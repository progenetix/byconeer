Cases were selected based upon the availability of frozen material with a fraction of neoplastic cells in the specimen representing >70% of overall cellularity as determined by morphologic and/or immunophenotypic studies. Genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = 08-803.CEL!Sample_description = Hybridized to 250K_Nsp!Sample_data_processing = Data acquisition was performed using the GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS) v1.4 and Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) v4.1. Genotype calls were calculated using the BRLMM algorithm. Mapping data for probes were derived from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Human Genome Build 36, as provided by Affymetrix, which was used for all subsequent analyses. The modified Bayesian Piecewise Regression (mBPCR) method was used to estimate the copy number (CN) starting from raw CN values obtained with Affymetrix CNAT 4.01 using a Gaussian bandwidth of 0 Kb and 46 Caucasian normal female samples of the HapMap Project as reference samples.!Sample_data_processing = signal = log2ratio; loh = 0 or 1!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Francesco,,Bertoni!Sample_contact_email = francesco.bertoni@ior.usi.ch!Sample_contact_phone = +41 91 820 0367!Sample_contact_department = Lymphoma & Genomics Research Program!Sample_contact_institute = IOR!Sample_contact_address = Via V.
