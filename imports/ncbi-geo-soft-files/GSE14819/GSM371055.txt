To identify regions of similar genomic status within the array-CGH data, we applied the segmentation software GLAD. Imbalances with log2 ratios of less than -1.0 were scored as putative homozygous deletions, because this threshold corresponds to an average copy number of less than 1, suggesting the presence of at least one subpopulation of cells with homozygous deletions. Gains with log2 ratios higher than 1.0 were scored as amplifications. Chromosomal mapping information was based on Ensembl (v49) and position of candidate genes was verified using Ensembl v52. All data are available at the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8175!Sample_contact_name = Aurelie,,Ernst!Sample_contact_institute = DKFZ!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM371nnn/GSM371055/suppl/GSM371055_153355.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14819!Sample_series_id = GSE14824!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (glioblastoma/reference DNA)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEG007563	0.199938952G007109	0.086214317G007107	0.631699227G007641	0.137430394G000001	0.146249778G003128	0.19841587G007091	0.479085648G003295	0.186067039G007108	-0.178379794G007087	-0.057522734G007105	0.081859334G004205	0.174118711G008027	0.049851244G006935	0.092254781G003545	0.089886994G004383	0.123082529G007635	0.060746997G007004	0.065749909G004055	0.077710692G004626	0.164673874!sample_table_end
