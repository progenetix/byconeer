To identify regions of similar genomic status within the array-CGH data, we applied the segmentation software GLAD. Imbalances with log2 ratios of less than -1.0 were scored as putative homozygous deletions, because this threshold corresponds to an average copy number of less than 1, suggesting the presence of at least one subpopulation of cells with homozygous deletions. Gains with log2 ratios higher than 1.0 were scored as amplifications. Chromosomal mapping information was based on Ensembl (v49) and position of candidate genes was verified using Ensembl v52. All data are available at the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8175!Sample_contact_name = Aurelie,,Ernst!Sample_contact_institute = DKFZ!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM371nnn/GSM371053/suppl/GSM371053_156151.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14819!Sample_series_id = GSE14824!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (glioblastoma/reference DNA)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEG007563	-0.088370291G007109	-0.031917331G007107	0.354009507G007641	-0.185862402G000001	-0.637186716G003128	-0.166153801G007091	0.00374508G003295	-0.611286425G007108	-0.129167454G007087	-0.028616733G007105	-0.596321735G004205	-0.481357327G008027	-0.567609281G006935	-0.212517838G003545	-0.718597731G004383	-0.65071753G007635	-0.021862443G007004	-0.410821158G004055	-0.495755178G004626	-0.609212003!sample_table_end
