To identify regions of similar genomic status within the array-CGH data, we applied the segmentation software GLAD. Imbalances with log2 ratios of less than -1.0 were scored as putative homozygous deletions, because this threshold corresponds to an average copy number of less than 1, suggesting the presence of at least one subpopulation of cells with homozygous deletions. Gains with log2 ratios higher than 1.0 were scored as amplifications. Chromosomal mapping information was based on Ensembl (v49) and position of candidate genes was verified using Ensembl v52. All data are available at the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8175!Sample_contact_name = Aurelie,,Ernst!Sample_contact_institute = DKFZ!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM371nnn/GSM371041/suppl/GSM371041_153367.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14819!Sample_series_id = GSE14824!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (glioblastoma/reference DNA)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEG007563	-0.017701849G007109	0.103990797G007107	0.704701278G007641	-0.05499129G000001	0.145382693G003128	0.209307527G007091	0.074549761G003295	0.096504838G007108	-0.127217287G007087	-0.005849622G007105	0.008498203G004205	0.022498851G008027	0.098127548G006935	-0.022422894G003545	0.045959105G004383	0.074169757G007635	0.024719475G007004	0.078006504G004055	0.075860837G004626	0.051851874!sample_table_end
