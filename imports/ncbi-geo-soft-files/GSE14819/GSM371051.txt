To identify regions of similar genomic status within the array-CGH data, we applied the segmentation software GLAD. Imbalances with log2 ratios of less than -1.0 were scored as putative homozygous deletions, because this threshold corresponds to an average copy number of less than 1, suggesting the presence of at least one subpopulation of cells with homozygous deletions. Gains with log2 ratios higher than 1.0 were scored as amplifications. Chromosomal mapping information was based on Ensembl (v49) and position of candidate genes was verified using Ensembl v52. All data are available at the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8175!Sample_contact_name = Aurelie,,Ernst!Sample_contact_institute = DKFZ!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM371nnn/GSM371051/suppl/GSM371051_156719.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14819!Sample_series_id = GSE14824!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (glioblastoma/reference DNA)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEG007563	-0.016062721G007109	-0.097697393G007107	0.359574708G007641	-0.047389205G000001	0.158546272G003128	0.242354587G007091	0.00502383G003295	0.144199303G007108	0.022729236G007087	0.02893369G007105	0.175814402G004205	0.026500905G008027	0.050089251G006935	0.067499582G003545	0.015042554G004383	0.091469393G007635	0.032053487G007004	0.032689674G004055	-0.022864621G004626	0.146474046!sample_table_end
