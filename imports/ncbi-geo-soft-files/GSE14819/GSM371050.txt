To identify regions of similar genomic status within the array-CGH data, we applied the segmentation software GLAD. Imbalances with log2 ratios of less than -1.0 were scored as putative homozygous deletions, because this threshold corresponds to an average copy number of less than 1, suggesting the presence of at least one subpopulation of cells with homozygous deletions. Gains with log2 ratios higher than 1.0 were scored as amplifications. Chromosomal mapping information was based on Ensembl (v49) and position of candidate genes was verified using Ensembl v52. All data are available at the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8175!Sample_contact_name = Aurelie,,Ernst!Sample_contact_institute = DKFZ!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM371nnn/GSM371050/suppl/GSM371050_146842.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14819!Sample_series_id = GSE14824!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (glioblastoma/reference DNA)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEG007563	0.072612774G007109	-0.137634574G007107	-0.011592312G007641	0.035403883G000001	0.02327769G003128	0.065892141G007091	0.008231418G003295	0.040338296G007108	-0.081502173G007087	0.03241613G007105	0.005551626G004205	0.027734461G008027	0.043949195G006935	0.001308433G003545	-0.03074256G004383	0.010103101G007635	0.064714216G007004	-0.026273644G004055	-0.041243289G004626	0.038625913!sample_table_end
