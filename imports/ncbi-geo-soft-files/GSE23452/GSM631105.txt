Cell suspensions were run through Miltenyi MACS LS separation columns (#130-042-401) in order to negatively enrich for AML blasts.  AML blast DNA used for SNP 6.0 profiling was extracted from samples that were further purified as follows:  post-Miltenyi column samples were washed and stained with FITC-conjugated anti-CD33, PE-conjugated anti-CD13, and APC-conjugated anti-CD45 (all antibodies: eBioscience, San Diego, CA).  After final washing, propidium iodide (PI) was added to a concentration of 1 Î¼g/ml to discriminate dead cells.  Sorting of cells was done on a FACS-ARIA high-speed flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA).  Live cells (PI-negative) were gated for blasts by identifying those cells with intermediate-intensity staining for CD45 and low- to moderate-intensity side scatter(20).  CD33 and CD13 were then used in order to further discriminate blasts versus erythroid lineage and mature myeloid lineage cells.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Highly pure blast cells or buccal swabs were digested overnight in 100 mM Tris pH 8.0, 50 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5% SDS and 100 Î¼g/ml of Proteinase K (Invitrogen) at 56C. DNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform and precipitated using ammonium acetate, ethanol and glycogen.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Biotinylated, fragmented DNA was prepared from genomic DNA according to the standard Affymetrix protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The DNA was prepared for hybridization to SNP 6.0 arrays according to the manufacturersâ recommendations.!Sample_scan_protocol = SNP 6.0 arrays were scanned using the Affymetrix 3000 7G GeneChip Scanner with Autoloader.!Sample_description = Primary AML!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix CEL files for each blast and buccal sample were analyzed using Genotyping Console software for initial quality control, followed by use of the Affymetrix âBirdseedâ algorithm to generate tab-delimited SNP call files in text format. Sample copy number heatmap displays were obtained from CEL files through use of the freely available software dChip adapted to operate in a 64-bit environment.!Sample_data_processing = dChip SNP software (www.dchip.org), build date Feb 25, 2009, compatible with 64-bit OS, analyzed the CEL files.  CEL files were normalized using the invariant set method, followed by model-based expression index calculations, and finally inferred copy number data were generated using a median-smoothing algorithm.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Sami,N,Malek!Sample_contact_email = smalek@med.umich.edu, pouillet@med.umich.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 734-763-1222!Sample_contact_department = Internal Medicine, Hematology-Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Michigan!Sample_contact_address = 4410 Cancer Center; 1500 E Medical Center Dr!Sample_contact_city = Ann Arbor!Sample_contact_state = MI!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 48109!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM631nnn/GSM631105/suppl/GSM631105.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE23452!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = SNP call!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-2131660	BBSNP_A-1967418	BBSNP_A-1969580	BBSNP_A-4263484	BBSNP_A-1978185	AASNP_A-4264431	ABSNP_A-1980898	ABSNP_A-1983139	AASNP_A-4265735	AASNP_A-1995832	ABSNP_A-1995893	ABSNP_A-1997689	BBSNP_A-1997709	AASNP_A-1997896	AASNP_A-1997922	ABSNP_A-2000230	AASNP_A-2000332	AASNP_A-2000337	AASNP_A-2000342	AASNP_A-4268173	AB!sample_table_end
