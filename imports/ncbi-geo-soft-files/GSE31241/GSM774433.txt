Image data acquisition was performed in feature extraction software v9.5.1 (Agilent Technologies) using the Agilent CGH-v4_95 protocol with default settings!Sample_description = Pooled DNA from 5 normal cervical FFPE biopsies was used as reference in the aCGH experiments; across array CGH comparisons were made as described by Buffart et al, Genes, Chromosomes & Cancer 2008, 47(11): 994-1004!Sample_data_processing = Median Signal intensity minus median Background intensity; excluding negative values. To overcome potential wave bias due to differences in GC-content of the different chromosomal regions, a smoothing algorithm was applied on our dataset as described by van de Wiel et al, Bioinformatics 2009; 25(9):1099-1104.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8693!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM774nnn/GSM774433/suppl/GSM774433_MAF_251901510361_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07_1_1_e_Cy3.txt.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM774nnn/GSM774433/suppl/GSM774433_MAF_251901510361_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07_1_2_Cy5.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31241!Sample_data_row_count = 98639#ID_REF = #VALUE = wavecorrected&normalized log2 ratio (test/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE4	0.0344259485	-0.1463161236	-0.2536292017	-0.5570488738	0.0741174079	0.55497150510	0.15671110311	0.13272159912	-0.38839394713	0.27035452214	0.48148189915	0.29478148816	-0.00895534717	0.33043531918	0.25931442220	0.04872628122	0.13448142923	-0.31476915624	0.24037664325	0.353495622!sample_table_end
