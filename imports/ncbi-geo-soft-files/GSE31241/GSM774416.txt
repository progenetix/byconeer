Image data acquisition was performed in feature extraction software v9.5.1 (Agilent Technologies) using the Agilent CGH-v4_95 protocol with default settings!Sample_description = Pooled DNA from 5 normal cervical FFPE biopsies was used as reference in the aCGH experiments; across array CGH comparisons were made as described by Buffart et al, Genes, Chromosomes & Cancer 2008, 47(11): 994-1004!Sample_data_processing = Median Signal intensity minus median Background intensity; excluding negative values. To overcome potential wave bias due to differences in GC-content of the different chromosomal regions, a smoothing algorithm was applied on our dataset as described by van de Wiel et al, Bioinformatics 2009; 25(9):1099-1104.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8693!Sample_contact_name = Daoud,,Sie!Sample_contact_email = d.sie@vumc.nl!Sample_contact_phone = +31 20 4442428!Sample_contact_laboratory = Microarray Core Facility!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Vrije Universiteit Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = De Boelelaan 1117!Sample_contact_city = Amsterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1081 HV!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM774nnn/GSM774416/suppl/GSM774416_MAF_251901510361_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07_1_1_Cy5.txt.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM774nnn/GSM774416/suppl/GSM774416_MAF_251901510361_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07_1_1_c_Cy3.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE31241!Sample_data_row_count = 98639#ID_REF = #VALUE = wavecorrected&normalized log2 ratio (test/reference)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE4	0.2332391545	0.209863576	-0.1962856897	-0.4474072148	0.282142929	-0.07454409910	0.29123772411	-0.00863201112	0.10614924113	-0.24447286314	-0.04925404215	-0.4213580416	-0.37707957417	0.27042286518	-0.02466510820	0.26645173122	-0.13639002623	-0.42235628424	0.12466371525	-0.26062136!sample_table_end
