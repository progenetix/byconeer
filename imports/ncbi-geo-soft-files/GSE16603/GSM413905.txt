Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413905/suppl/GSM413905_NN834.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413905/suppl/GSM413905_NN835.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16603!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3218.8638144587999	4038.9744385173058	3415.8082949683671	3801.7182263804116	1.0596483491193947	1.2162982491530041	0.87120765803724876	-0.3534	0.782744097105704472	3716.8333345133738	3534.5220796285107	3907.9758804686871	3332.7686893552168	1.3895112603458706	1.2194470486675	1.1394601035479166	0.0538	1.03801896713879633	2166.9550811685463	3915.3652054614099	2354.9111217276472	3687.5138550762472	0.74961323213291509	1.1972000745036948	0.62613864474045478	-0.4586	0.727698408721358384	10257.867453881347	16761.363483389508	9824.0459658987857	15551.627228033421	3.0767110506198003	4.6490344580518563	0.66179570798644338	-0.4193	0.747794774202130255	7733.7704803644647	10398.100672536473	7638.9995088820469	9696.9956542655127	2.7770941210613413	3.6186714079181606	0.76743473170420251	-0.6037	0.658054227196358646	8682.8639117365765	18296.015209915291	8476.5169939511688	16917.268488162594	2.9754866560931887	6.1129896143692806	0.48674819422218013	-0.9844	0.505424988457620187	2085.2249055675379	3229.4972904306624	2271.0548341597073	3048.4384740138776	0.61283412302576412	0.84874047507337025	0.72205125244296509	-0.2845	0.821053425035367828	2097.0512699557034	3217.1724194657459	2282.7952680858057	3035.9586930006649	0.72541571574965302	1.0068367704147771	0.72048989177343037	-0.4852	0.714381998956626359	2657.703252746348	4190.1587690543474	2851.9257594224609	3941.334703152917	0.82907695229887934	1.1909326482721265	0.69615771597306675	-0.5712	0.6730392509436322610	11854.47780423676	14565.278728066438	11142.083723233096	13564.49001193165	3.3246636851833462	3.982699067048705	0.83477652446561013	-0.3258	0.797840632759859511	5915.2379022713731	10923.772302858608	5999.7718284930052	10184.412203692529	1.6803264631425443	2.7603188849781475	0.60874360288117457	-0.5838	0.6671886380080382912	10481.578021624844	19745.996887588612	10009.933959563592	18171.579526212681	3.3710102076753508	5.8234690066134753	0.57886634304175599	-0.6402	0.6416378771115135413	3073.4219052914791	4203.6279963410552	3271.5701823416357	3955.9484969059495	0.98395648924891355	1.2463628946853273	0.78946227735489172	-0.1891	0.8771780532141931814	5103.1017234418759	8970.8391565598704	5230.2825132259741	8366.5665710188659	1.5911417968138371	2.5027524695201024	0.6357567582857826	-0.6209	0.6502530036530725915	1377.1556594128976	1647.6184868890741	1538.0566081836184	1589.677985466931	0.48416592745742004	0.52219504457283106	0.92717449636750215	-0.1590	0.8956599620699995416	2289.1195961961735	4080.9532487820406	2478.804954563941	3841.0028835246235	0.7301433022879843	1.164793238910925	0.6268436988616658	-0.3857	0.7654123272489411517	296.51724959924525	314.12591499864499	307.06651062481905	317.91227934878924	0.11802817615978629	0.12291102403009238	0.96027331226928336	0.1287	1.093325056769192318	4528.5118148396014	7046.7650212610106	4692.037033933525	6596.4063717892104	1.5307630687770892	2.1957628829433697	0.69714406809041995	-0.3293	0.7959332499362745719	1345.6934808358587	1686.5651284241267	1505.1154419216527	1625.4624748032811	0.46113165391800526	0.51018695420902505	0.90384838364384801	-0.0201	0.9861974111436796520	2243.9391931245859	3967.2814191403236	2433.1880033586581	3734.309001750461	0.73835141267896176	1.1715770364812614	0.63022011330688221	-0.4195	0.74768816547796368!sample_table_end
