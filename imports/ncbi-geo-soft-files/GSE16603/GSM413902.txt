Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413902/suppl/GSM413902_NN822.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413902/suppl/GSM413902_NN823.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16603!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3189.426116408893	5789.1756558563065	3280.7993024112666	5398.5190132180178	1.209241332660393	1.9625338306346516	0.61616330571450273	-0.6030	0.658395360341078152	1822.1217809601148	2190.7423427287067	1905.9269656885149	2163.9651027819718	0.69444958865796524	0.77818002191218105	0.8924022322643681	-0.3312	0.794847821728649543	2402.9144194256528	2999.363461437983	2488.3800551897348	2911.8628619427382	0.86133470446409499	1.0217639440280055	0.8429879616504522	-0.2178	0.859884529176694	4814.9691576408968	9666.5044630273514	4905.8445330555433	8826.087468864258	1.5451132279003148	2.8545529602405155	0.54128028080800739	-0.7460	0.596255276894869125	5490.4298701609387	8497.1643859139258	5574.1414966297571	7773.0110099622934	2.0103938352095296	2.795191380158303	0.71923298328705942	-0.5997	0.659880040705889246	9879.7032986704216	11008.309315674249	9954.6261866470431	10008.40906757083	3.5602422535476039	3.527885538207169	1.0091717021399957	0.0527	1.03723177484845597	1734.5660826845365	2359.3042581994637	1817.934867433323	2323.2578984067286	0.57881652267653372	0.77126238652888623	0.75047938650493906	-0.2577	0.836436359261664498	1941.337091673541	1934.7452981331944	2025.4379858467373	1925.2973327375992	0.72635913244391048	0.70117314844274869	1.0359197782417908	0.0718	1.05104849922309559	4595.6555066124083	5961.8963160076901	4688.0339082737746	5545.201288331592	1.564721933425067	1.8404281341643216	0.85019453048926374	-0.1459	0.9038173530049087310	11060.339996790501	11031.891749263676	11131.226670550832	10032.021987483535	3.9173532443856161	3.7036280680742806	1.0577069760739939	0.0328	1.023003336306141911	10409.57574721028	13885.679670968508	10480.10875226463	12616.279734499178	3.3062199245512374	4.0668637921535167	0.81296549221298164	-0.2338	0.8504085095545976812	9380.5846748617478	18070.719821546983	9459.2348003188399	16601.153484587347	2.9779237792988891	5.2585144916347044	0.56630513884409739	-0.6791	0.6245425680396694513	3947.5329671219943	4859.0312532313701	4043.4465919424492	4582.4162730493299	1.5059011991439724	1.6290554900508614	0.92440141440299006	-0.1598	0.8951647883888800314	4411.7484959913627	6379.8674583114498	4506.103006803799	5926.4166559624673	1.7255604210255713	2.1726746506549697	0.79421022402290564	-0.4012	0.75722108521969315	2454.3336886028778	3145.9757997340789	2542.8498785642328	3046.9089346640899	0.9082888871423791	1.1106953966428257	0.81776595985520595	-0.2451	0.8437645765157828516	3472.4340942300814	5034.1866048442143	3566.9779232044834	4735.2216403871907	1.1319785138807559	1.5478810047162712	0.73130848587953923	-0.3396	0.7902545265620188917	1123.9391976982895	1185.7103658260414	1197.4230915444414	1212.1232938857511	0.33155760466972606	0.35525501104517204	0.93329465978332748	-0.0396	0.9729387287624083918	5110.3997036231458	5965.832807103835	5199.9391699829721	5553.3512783564011	1.7117193871531893	1.7769109362873179	0.9633118645381632	-0.0272	0.9813116069541366619	2147.1144073280716	2925.563693315039	2232.5193979112228	2845.845658708487	0.82203488748811115	1.0273458296005371	0.80015401221587001	-0.1827	0.8810397465680441820	1629.4500637007764	2317.7977815502854	1711.9738201135783	2283.3243508906967	0.61437690678849044	0.83553996036158618	0.73530523485987942	-0.3080	0.80777857412798437!sample_table_end
