Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413903/suppl/GSM413903_NN826.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413903/suppl/GSM413903_NN827.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16603!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3424.7826070385672	5421.5716946975554	3575.3291642138279	5092.6674621324764	1.3470911422802307	1.9109005345753785	0.70495094742310493	-0.4469	0.73364173888115982	1626.0884063627939	2250.0356887082007	1704.9181419317106	2175.1454437100165	0.62632269884027525	0.8172028422240768	0.76642256546207377	-0.5687	0.67420089606621073	3240.3730867394006	4699.4071158596116	3381.534246382017	4433.2226416889471	1.2042875863977518	1.6309110275094887	0.73841403122816596	-0.3730	0.772174618901869454	6204.4290760343292	13421.78449139946	6418.225541787112	12300.6281026911	2.2640691560339401	4.3755420516607577	0.51743741216579153	-0.7346	0.600995023481572855	7168.4412020282125	13605.940460225453	7369.4066844566005	12468.436481586583	2.9389437725852177	5.0729806633891066	0.5793327370228526	-0.6630	0.631544960420678656	7256.485551991922	13004.98715652019	7453.4257866576309	11927.573788383448	2.8854043445720676	4.5325875359641579	0.63659098068765574	-0.6344	0.644208921032398357	2198.5925021041935	3852.6771381339818	2293.061544522011	3657.4036208006291	0.83775058431055616	1.3572957600048781	0.6172203649317709	-0.6709	0.62809749582044358	1279.9263226794274	1662.8808542080208	1351.6852131547216	1622.2080719895355	0.48913527077053093	0.58841678582404178	0.83127348259707945	-0.2266	0.854657339659219869	2526.2400356624294	3528.0491843496143	2634.361350810841	3360.8472776835324	0.94179490007387212	1.2666283446322131	0.74354478491268738	-0.2833	0.8217247943635219710	8733.7374257856809	12409.497891118781	8900.3454309348854	11365.591333842842	3.0062768955416561	3.9369286093479108	0.76360970539407313	-0.4618	0.726103727578546811	12066.788399653646	16066.81421123381	12065.850515074066	14808.018572974008	4.6799319784337419	5.5996789110958503	0.83575005866146779	-0.3534	0.782722729323157912	14728.387131853258	32370.112961403822	14589.373445920017	31424.874013635206	5.6433698949592195	11.909625004761828	0.47384950346487231	-0.8113	0.5698489180377308613	3948.4643003912556	5124.6895474844096	4117.3298530537095	4821.8176804999357	1.5517695183902094	1.8157097455541105	0.85463523131371821	-0.2485	0.8417559334630038114	7118.0813714939004	12358.965093165085	7318.1355376951533	11326.907630794365	2.569229364467605	3.845088355303536	0.6681847403906499	-0.7894	0.5785652091342439215	3039.9045632569855	3177.0353921340297	3172.1410267954952	3035.8121211749676	1.155820976203912	1.0999023306366997	1.0508396464028245	0.0948	1.067943273965279416	3236.9670149239332	4462.4157915515116	3377.9605477875643	4212.9380439720817	1.2481232908813065	1.5480361593125935	0.80626236239567972	-0.3315	0.7947143729880479217	756.00748731446561	733.16204082812362	817.75537092663762	725.51665000599394	0.3211447938473771	0.27971836352511842	1.14810050294942	0.2620	1.199106896572464718	3670.2714950058071	5774.2169756872045	3828.6635622636468	5409.8290714371788	1.4382773553237962	2.0510543679104614	0.70123804508851717	-0.3681	0.7748018699737935219	1880.1865892167057	2542.6095591930671	1964.7309050044707	2448.1118509497569	0.78534504977636554	0.99895686711174414	0.78616512447330344	-0.2890	0.8184648939639552820	1312.574589213659	2128.0848471325348	1384.664713880092	2061.6488386170863	0.6167564471986815	0.93083783146043608	0.66258205925195668	-0.5142	0.70016985828102618!sample_table_end
