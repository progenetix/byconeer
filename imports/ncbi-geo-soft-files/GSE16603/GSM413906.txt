Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413906/suppl/GSM413906_NN836.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413906/suppl/GSM413906_NN837.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16603!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	4250.6626400738996	5250.3874105106397	4433.7056999327106	4996.4458806535104	1.3735779038684381	1.5643032361555782	0.87807649573373925	-0.1206	0.91979708778776272	2987.41629329121	2753.1713040229401	3152.3678782158631	2614.0553431789167	0.94903938169138935	0.82340962035797638	1.1525726178409181	-0.0186	0.987169849747845163	4141.750160363039	5350.0652400432473	4324.2511374907981	5091.8139605236984	1.209284693188788	1.4658601252552748	0.82496595163075004	-0.0029	0.998016538946339134	11070.381545053695	13205.431386244223	11234.190588651321	12380.202141893578	3.4483885213478565	3.7241880675736745	0.92594371142875664	-0.0576	0.960842048820985675	10854.639222181771	10521.056001223429	11014.327872500771	9903.016271619721	3.2700550634092731	3.0804459842886507	1.0615524765205089	0.0558	1.03940939088663336	10486.497626606753	12494.498964331131	10653.202573898063	11722.371049674794	3.2534899833013444	3.7280634016983956	0.87270242824173849	-0.0358	0.975515050078976547	2875.9830646686191	3809.1597459824025	3036.8295841243539	3619.8776610435611	0.88086336949371025	1.0901734926237805	0.8080029238040709	-0.2627	0.833553161393837628	2148.4816518886705	2416.279579302045	2293.3953343378657	2291.7757734491738	0.69900061332900953	0.70777953063725496	0.98759653687590943	-0.1336	0.91152671189860299	3008.2647298191646	3978.9592899346221	3174.5246367141808	3782.9234961011784	0.89540993931999069	1.0973072983573482	0.81600654680817797	-0.0989	0.9337280245605009710	12470.89794840415	16730.396482098375	12663.016470575736	15677.184227324411	3.6751498301017023	4.7477123839508506	0.77408855737031701	-0.1766	0.8847989807356814211	12706.308630872762	13753.526195339327	12863.564671473108	12889.284946202786	3.5352688966295989	3.5628778406874537	0.99225094283543358	-0.0654	0.9556567179390513812	21041.529806954302	27018.431617622788	21488.39123065758	25608.774282497707	6.5676096268801283	7.7094702391165821	0.85188857641049798	-0.1974	0.8721307657697817713	4199.3485956362629	4184.6441637833505	4382.7368817235292	3978.3895984182554	1.3349304006020353	1.2162538364994875	1.0975754900343107	0.1158	1.083588693102204514	7357.6587671328252	8924.9363778157385	7539.2331924584341	8437.3767790493039	2.2771352720883224	2.5590400726160931	0.88983963027996638	-0.1023	0.931516321438434115	3208.0629204032016	3244.5454211182273	3377.4173703741058	3078.9583054806162	0.98317595220351628	0.95734230668630727	1.0269847528274689	0.0943	1.067539081509342216	3806.7210806280145	5520.7281666736699	3985.5597643517012	5255.1128533252022	1.1267574591777594	1.5655406821278677	0.71972416433553255	-0.2104	0.8643132983939767517	668.02855333431876	745.55641596129124	733.02051615758933	728.05145667407317	0.22349740270118154	0.22502427666366173	0.99321462561676277	0.1669	1.122646250357238318	5546.7176734483237	5782.7939989983297	5739.6842174526219	5501.6389261288705	1.872126958210222	1.8517043961275217	1.0110290617257323	0.1806	1.1333162371103819	2638.7612130172629	2917.9952921448689	2795.0463712807482	2766.2378438229039	0.87129964126502613	0.85934751306958501	1.013908375847564	0.0482	1.033946908528047720	2736.9404224352588	3028.2729793341796	2895.1592380150773	2871.6010969529975	0.80887229796411642	0.8181056389539676	0.98871375461773248	0.1434	1.1045380830737943!sample_table_end
