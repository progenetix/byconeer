Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413904/suppl/GSM413904_NN830.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM413nnn/GSM413904/suppl/GSM413904_NN831.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16603!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Mean of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3487.1867632342687	7704.9560417181328	3845.5358528469105	7274.9406448837162	1.1163157828039043	2.0847921529614695	0.53545663111699926	-0.8640	0.549409722684727212	2134.0986871539999	1973.7402496503789	2471.5708415263721	1734.0276857877868	0.75702125870914416	0.53121053402605267	1.4250870610032307	0.2172	1.162459648019473	2480.4096232129577	4578.2466833445496	2829.8597481683055	4168.2430739469455	0.81461411493121894	1.1424000317202951	0.71307255979722239	-0.4626	0.725699569515378514	10232.246753782694	14586.4204975225	9859.2494425833502	13980.942747950796	2.900097062831557	4.2073238523781091	0.68929732166739022	-0.4735	0.720218201297693655	9768.8912714055368	12355.60727908789	9487.261727303834	11836.987610692675	2.726265996638094	3.4454814443145496	0.79125835988371207	-0.3369	0.791754289256719096	7736.4209539219273	13555.293206485692	7791.5078350996209	12995.212407496274	2.3128536099930637	3.8067388318841222	0.60756823941303351	-0.6266	0.647715166349982167	2250.4723857571789	3811.2333137443079	2592.5162958364554	3424.1872487887695	0.68975556397162996	0.93555276929032072	0.73727061328123245	-0.3112	0.805962526341195588	1202.9790143600335	2646.729577841927	1475.2509856745728	2330.7921573141989	0.42876561367874788	0.68367529737017541	0.62714802674315895	-0.6317	0.645436785623919379	1723.5823764913828	3560.6265985225814	2039.4194355796928	3185.7961647259058	0.53640072117045989	0.86214637716415865	0.62216896733340399	-0.4634	0.7252768744049951110	9603.8526383698827	13389.674433839822	9339.6053058025154	12840.577255524244	2.6525677767883904	3.7986643496017862	0.69828959146297276	-0.4523	0.7308550703592626711	8999.3285052514639	13973.040942216796	8847.2631826887209	13400.559754795793	2.3336779205603269	3.5149857309892396	0.66392244497207331	-0.5561	0.6801205804970341712	15243.569514600573	24024.218024760783	13967.522594124837	22789.528316943841	4.3152735019313893	7.1453635015031818	0.60392637841637864	-0.4883	0.7128438617116877913	3200.5126884386127	5055.3200066409154	3559.3585318454152	4631.0708857844411	1.0448575724856637	1.3826230794630756	0.7557067345436046	-0.2252	0.8554927305718588214	7446.531155144633	9154.3824252072936	7541.0974234213018	8710.8404760102676	2.2993991268259713	2.7497436799935038	0.83622307910219573	-0.1179	0.9215469836606499115	2912.3196277616007	4116.6784059744032	3268.7902629839177	3719.8793506848283	0.94788401931351796	1.08057057103714	0.87720695410363769	-0.2184	0.859513792855862616	3018.3100228274616	5776.8718897116241	3377.4193834723296	5345.5433222631627	0.8695695728412941	1.3958879972197313	0.62295082024722959	-0.4531	0.730477830616177117	509.00580415348827	538.53224487669593	650.30876380875486	469.28776387993923	0.17014437389879791	0.12093357464648757	1.4069242093948107	0.3938	1.313838771841376918	4080.0059965856767	7541.9617714949063	4434.2110119205508	7102.4685061026094	1.356380753161478	2.1287803124105769	0.63716333021961624	-0.5178	0.6984245771865901219	1630.0976282578997	2564.2223121804086	1939.1279004793305	2253.6593882071224	0.58744493446751811	0.70441099370730631	0.83395196797795945	-0.1610	0.8944014832336547620	1465.241579778326	3419.3789539647646	1760.8251311691276	3053.899480034419	0.46755831509296741	0.8239197217706371	0.56748042647670272	-0.5962	0.66148184668501231!sample_table_end
