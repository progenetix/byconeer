The reference and test samples with similar efficiencies were combined. Was added to each reaction Human Cot DNA, 2X and 10X Blocking Agent Hi-RPM Hybridization Solution. The reaction was denatured at 95 Â° C for 3 min and incubated at 37 Â° C for 30min. The samples were applied onto the 4x44 k (Agilent) slides and kept at 65 Â° C at 20rpm for 24 hours.!Sample_scan_protocol = The array images were acquired with a DNA microarray scanner using SureScan High-Resolution Technology and the Scan Control (version 8.1) software program (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).!Sample_scan_protocol = Images were quantified using Agilent Feature Extraction Software (version v.10.1.1.1).!Sample_description = Tumor sample Cy5-labeled mixed with reference sample Cy3-labeled!Sample_data_processing = The data were analyzed using the Nexus Copy Number (version 6.0, Biodiscovery Inc., El Segundo, CA, USA) software program [20].!Sample_platform_id = GPL8841!Sample_contact_name = Fabio,Albuquerque,Marchi!Sample_contact_email = biomarchi@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = Hospital AC Camargo!Sample_contact_address = Rua Tagua!Sample_contact_city = Sao Paulo!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 01509-010!Sample_contact_country = Brazil!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1109nnn/GSM1109930/suppl/GSM1109930_LMS4.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE45573!Sample_data_row_count = 42494
