The 200-400 mg of tissue was homogenized using the PRO250 laboratory homogenizer (PRO Scientific Inc., Oxford, CT) for 30-60 seconds and processed using the Gentra Puregene Tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturerâs protocol.  Genomic DNA, used as the referent, was isolated from blood clots using Clotspin and Puregene DNA purification kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturerâs protocols.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to 250K_Sty!Sample_data_processing = SNP data was imported into PartekÂ® Genomics Suiteâ¢ 6.5 (Partek, Inc, St Louis, MO) as CEL files using default Partek parameters.  The rest of the rows are individual markers from the microarray with the log2 normalized intensities associated with each marker (marker labels are the row headers).  See Partek Intensity data.txt, linked as a supplementary file on the Series record.!Sample_data_processing = Copy number alterations were identified using Partek Genomics Suite.  Copy number was calculated as a paired analysis, using the genomic DNA from each patient as the referent sample.  Deletions and amplifications were detected using a Hidden Markov Model using a minimum of five consecutive altered markers.
