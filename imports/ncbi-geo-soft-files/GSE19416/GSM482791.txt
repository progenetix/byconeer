For samples with < 80% overall tumor cells, needle dissection of serial tumor sections was performed to enrich for the epithelial fraction prior to DNA extraction. Needle-dissected samples were stained with cresyl-violet to facilitate  morphological distinction between tumor and stromal elements.!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = NA (Fresh-frozen (LN2) tissue collected at surgery)!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted using a DNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturerâs protocol!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = The mapping array assays were performed according to the manufacturerâs 'cytogenetics copy number assay' protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was Sty/Nsp restriction digested, adapter ligated, PCR amplified, fragmented, labelled and hybridized to a SNP 6.0 array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were washed using an Affymetrix fluidics stations and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = none!Sample_data_processing = Data files (CEL) were generated using the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Command Console (AGCC) v1.0 and normalized using the R package Aroma.Affymetrix (Bengtsson et al., 2008).!Sample_data_processing = primary_data: log2 tumor copy number ratio at each marker was then estimated by normalization to the mean signal obtained from normal reference samples profiled at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Dariush,,Etemadmoghadam!Sample_contact_email = dariush.etemadmoghadam@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = 61396561149!Sample_contact_institute = Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = St Andrew's Place!Sample_contact_city = East Melbourne!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 3002!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM482nnn/GSM482791/suppl/GSM482791.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19416!Sample_data_row_count = 1878194#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-SNP_10000979	-0.255528127055562AFFX-SNP_10009702	-0.0775877329359602AFFX-SNP_10015773	-0.181045018653251AFFX-SNP_10021569	0.255179558458488AFFX-SNP_10026879	-0.203319909454585AFFX-SNP_10029725	-0.316993222054505AFFX-SNP_10034687	-0.0991877313121083AFFX-SNP_10036267	-0.250861247271546AFFX-SNP_10037362	0.0195235131197382AFFX-SNP_10037636	0.0757124320766795AFFX-SNP_10039349	0.500691665343734AFFX-SNP_10039442	0.118361135756713AFFX-SNP_10039933	-0.227740965932034AFFX-SNP_10046830	0.894041383582724AFFX-SNP_10047363	0.180022902327623AFFX-SNP_10047841	-0.784282382365575AFFX-SNP_10049334	-0.286878591299326AFFX-SNP_10052664	0.598009103858857AFFX-SNP_10057887	-0.317431879442857AFFX-SNP_10064911	1.49818077837907!sample_table_end
