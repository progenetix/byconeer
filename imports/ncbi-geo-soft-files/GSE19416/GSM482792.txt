For samples with < 80% overall tumor cells, needle dissection of serial tumor sections was performed to enrich for the epithelial fraction prior to DNA extraction. Needle-dissected samples were stained with cresyl-violet to facilitate  morphological distinction between tumor and stromal elements.!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = NA (Fresh-frozen (LN2) tissue collected at surgery)!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Genomic DNA was extracted using a DNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturerâs protocol!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = The mapping array assays were performed according to the manufacturerâs 'cytogenetics copy number assay' protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was Sty/Nsp restriction digested, adapter ligated, PCR amplified, fragmented, labelled and hybridized to a SNP 6.0 array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were washed using an Affymetrix fluidics stations and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = none!Sample_data_processing = Data files (CEL) were generated using the Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Command Console (AGCC) v1.0 and normalized using the R package Aroma.Affymetrix (Bengtsson et al., 2008).!Sample_data_processing = primary_data: log2 tumor copy number ratio at each marker was then estimated by normalization to the mean signal obtained from normal reference samples profiled at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Dariush,,Etemadmoghadam!Sample_contact_email = dariush.etemadmoghadam@petermac.org!Sample_contact_phone = 61396561149!Sample_contact_institute = Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = St Andrew's Place!Sample_contact_city = East Melbourne!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 3002!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM482nnn/GSM482792/suppl/GSM482792.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19416!Sample_data_row_count = 1878194#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEAFFX-SNP_10000979	0.094684817313988AFFX-SNP_10009702	-0.97064080111184AFFX-SNP_10015773	0.220047162478085AFFX-SNP_10021569	-0.152964958436371AFFX-SNP_10026879	-0.256904504419063AFFX-SNP_10029725	0.5584148469653AFFX-SNP_10034687	-0.408608319198148AFFX-SNP_10036267	0.365134292440542AFFX-SNP_10037362	0.203366180104391AFFX-SNP_10037636	0.00532572493081318AFFX-SNP_10039349	0.0116630640124988AFFX-SNP_10039442	0.286924907192736AFFX-SNP_10039933	0.126196805013796AFFX-SNP_10046830	-0.105421968333429AFFX-SNP_10047363	-0.0978933733817033AFFX-SNP_10047841	0.627236975775638AFFX-SNP_10049334	0.0723630407186295AFFX-SNP_10052664	0.313897453337905AFFX-SNP_10057887	-0.354302024162838AFFX-SNP_10064911	1.29888807250732!sample_table_end
