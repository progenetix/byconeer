The log2ratio of Cy5 (tumor) to Cy3 (Control) was normalized by the Centralization Algorithm in DNA Analytics. Aberrant regions were determined by the ADM-2 algorithm at a threshold of 12.0 in DNA Analytics. To detect gains and losses, we set the values of parameters for aberration filters as: minimum number of probes in region 2, minimum absolute average log2ratio for region 0.263034, maximum number of aberrant regions 10000, and percentage penetrance per feature 0. We set the value of the minimum absolute average log2ratio at 0.263034 to detect regions showing a change in the averaged copy number equal to or more than 1.2-fold (log2(1.2)=0.263034).!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = A summary of the aberrations in the gastric CISs as determined by the ADM-2 algorithm is available in the 'GSE19566_aberrations.txt' file, which is linked to the Series GSE19566 record as a supplementary file.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Yoshiyuki,,Tsukamoto!Sample_contact_email = tuka@oita-u.ac.jp!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Oita university, Faculty of Medicine!Sample_contact_address = hasamacho idaigaoka 1-1!Sample_contact_city = Yufu-city!Sample_contact_state = Oita!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 879-5593!Sample_contact_country = Japan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM487nnn/GSM487665/suppl/GSM487665.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19566!Sample_series_id = GSE19575!Sample_data_row_count = 235829#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 Cy5/Cy3 representing tumor/control!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_14_P112718	0.11299353A_16_P15000916	-0.14225653A_16_P15001074	-0.25548247A_16_P00000012	0.12085376A_16_P00000014	-0.73596483A_16_P00000017	0.056132637A_16_P00000021	0.57987595A_16_P00000023	0.12494094A_16_P00000027	0.3388901A_16_P00000033	0.13038033A_16_P35001586	0.065197624A_16_P15001533	0.028199606A_16_P00000060	-0.03181439A_16_P15001594	0.32064316A_16_P00000082	0.15298864A_16_P00000090	0.4423025A_16_P00000099	-0.23152977A_16_P15001666	0.1318343A_16_P00000112	-0.43714252A_16_P00000114	-0.03732664!sample_table_end
