The log2ratio of Cy5 (tumor) to Cy3 (Control) was normalized by the Centralization Algorithm in DNA Analytics. Aberrant regions were determined by the ADM-2 algorithm at a threshold of 12.0 in DNA Analytics. To detect gains and losses, we set the values of parameters for aberration filters as: minimum number of probes in region 2, minimum absolute average log2ratio for region 0.263034, maximum number of aberrant regions 10000, and percentage penetrance per feature 0. We set the value of the minimum absolute average log2ratio at 0.263034 to detect regions showing a change in the averaged copy number equal to or more than 1.2-fold (log2(1.2)=0.263034).!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = A summary of the aberrations in the gastric CISs as determined by the ADM-2 algorithm is available in the 'GSE19566_aberrations.txt' file, which is linked to the Series GSE19566 record as a supplementary file.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Yoshiyuki,,Tsukamoto!Sample_contact_email = tuka@oita-u.ac.jp!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Oita university, Faculty of Medicine!Sample_contact_address = hasamacho idaigaoka 1-1!Sample_contact_city = Yufu-city!Sample_contact_state = Oita!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 879-5593!Sample_contact_country = Japan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM487nnn/GSM487682/suppl/GSM487682.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19566!Sample_series_id = GSE19575!Sample_data_row_count = 235829#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 Cy5/Cy3 representing tumor/control!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_14_P112718	0.053231403A_16_P15000916	0.1548878A_16_P15001074	-0.17505917A_16_P00000012	-0.04378598A_16_P00000014	-0.05837719A_16_P00000017	0.09114675A_16_P00000021	0.4143149A_16_P00000023	0.11071934A_16_P00000027	0.32646698A_16_P00000033	0.31003052A_16_P35001586	0.21470565A_16_P15001533	-0.23993915A_16_P00000060	0.32818833A_16_P15001594	0.46786284A_16_P00000082	0.22034645A_16_P00000090	0.46395782A_16_P00000099	0.09593497A_16_P15001666	0.47997937A_16_P00000112	0.66721964A_16_P00000114	0.18011375!sample_table_end
