The log2ratio of Cy5 (tumor) to Cy3 (Control) was normalized by the Centralization Algorithm in DNA Analytics. Aberrant regions were determined by the ADM-2 algorithm at a threshold of 12.0 in DNA Analytics. To detect gains and losses, we set the values of parameters for aberration filters as: minimum number of probes in region 2, minimum absolute average log2ratio for region 0.263034, maximum number of aberrant regions 10000, and percentage penetrance per feature 0. We set the value of the minimum absolute average log2ratio at 0.263034 to detect regions showing a change in the averaged copy number equal to or more than 1.2-fold (log2(1.2)=0.263034).!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = A summary of the aberrations in the gastric CISs as determined by the ADM-2 algorithm is available in the 'GSE19566_aberrations.txt' file, which is linked to the Series GSE19566 record as a supplementary file.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Yoshiyuki,,Tsukamoto!Sample_contact_email = tuka@oita-u.ac.jp!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Oita university, Faculty of Medicine!Sample_contact_address = hasamacho idaigaoka 1-1!Sample_contact_city = Yufu-city!Sample_contact_state = Oita!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 879-5593!Sample_contact_country = Japan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM487nnn/GSM487669/suppl/GSM487669.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19566!Sample_series_id = GSE19575!Sample_data_row_count = 235829#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 Cy5/Cy3 representing tumor/control!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_14_P112718	-0.31609342A_16_P15000916	-1.2743527A_16_P15001074	0.40674698A_16_P00000012	-0.35470662A_16_P00000014	-0.5870924A_16_P00000017	-0.3377434A_16_P00000021	0.2948362A_16_P00000023	0.18726057A_16_P00000027	-0.013094336A_16_P00000033	-0.054663416A_16_P35001586	-0.30664414A_16_P15001533	0.13596599A_16_P00000060	0.51025623A_16_P15001594	0.14467971A_16_P00000082	-0.13723263A_16_P00000090	0.15780419A_16_P00000099	-0.091244966A_16_P15001666	-0.058444325A_16_P00000112	0.62295556A_16_P00000114	-0.2021964!sample_table_end
