The log2ratio of Cy5 (tumor) to Cy3 (Control) was normalized by the Centralization Algorithm in DNA Analytics. Aberrant regions were determined by the ADM-2 algorithm at a threshold of 12.0 in DNA Analytics. To detect gains and losses, we set the values of parameters for aberration filters as: minimum number of probes in region 2, minimum absolute average log2ratio for region 0.263034, maximum number of aberrant regions 10000, and percentage penetrance per feature 0. We set the value of the minimum absolute average log2ratio at 0.263034 to detect regions showing a change in the averaged copy number equal to or more than 1.2-fold (log2(1.2)=0.263034).!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = A summary of the aberrations in the gastric CISs as determined by the ADM-2 algorithm is available in the 'GSE19566_aberrations.txt' file, which is linked to the Series GSE19566 record as a supplementary file.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9128!Sample_contact_name = Yoshiyuki,,Tsukamoto!Sample_contact_email = tuka@oita-u.ac.jp!Sample_contact_department = Molecular Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Oita university, Faculty of Medicine!Sample_contact_address = hasamacho idaigaoka 1-1!Sample_contact_city = Yufu-city!Sample_contact_state = Oita!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 879-5593!Sample_contact_country = Japan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM487nnn/GSM487668/suppl/GSM487668.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19566!Sample_series_id = GSE19575!Sample_data_row_count = 235829#ID_REF = #VALUE = log2 Cy5/Cy3 representing tumor/control!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_14_P112718	0.16384178A_16_P15000916	-0.535544A_16_P15001074	0.6805075A_16_P00000012	0.2433459A_16_P00000014	0.25066376A_16_P00000017	-0.02470152A_16_P00000021	0.3393593A_16_P00000023	0.21839948A_16_P00000027	0.56389916A_16_P00000033	-0.2533378A_16_P35001586	-0.22315057A_16_P15001533	0.2845688A_16_P00000060	0.023363337A_16_P15001594	0.10773371A_16_P00000082	0.1916851A_16_P00000090	0.4385967A_16_P00000099	0.0932776A_16_P15001666	-0.059006378A_16_P00000112	0.06792252A_16_P00000114	0.12338609!sample_table_end
