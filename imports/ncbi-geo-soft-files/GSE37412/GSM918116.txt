Microarray TIFF (.tif)!Sample_description = comparison between MBL and normal genomic DNA!Sample_data_processing = Images were processed and analyzed with Agilent CytoGenomics v1.5 software. Copy number aberration calls were made with a minimum regional absolute average log base 2 ratio of 0.25 and minimum contiguous probe count of 5.  All array data were also manually reviewed for subtle copy number changes not detected by the software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL11365!Sample_contact_name = Matija,,Snuderl!Sample_contact_email = MSnuderl@partners.org!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = MAssachusetts General Hospital!Sample_contact_address = 55 Fruit St.!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02114!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM918nnn/GSM918116/suppl/GSM918116_US45102802_253058710385_S01_CytoCGH_0105_May11_1_1_D283.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE37412!Sample_data_row_count = 0
