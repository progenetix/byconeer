Cells were fed every day and passaged once a week. For passaging, human ES cells were detached by treatment with 1 mg/ml collagenase IV (Invitrogen) for 3 min at 37 ËC, centrifuged, resuspended with human ES media supplemented with 10 Âµm Y 27632 (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany), and then seeded onto irradiated MEFs. The iPS-like lines were passaged mechanically with needles every 5-7 days. PanC-1 and MIAPaCa-2 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines were infected with the Tet0-mouse four transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) and the pWPTrtTA expressing lentivirus, followed by splitting onto irradiated MEFs 48 h post-infection. By the time of splitting, infected cells reached a confluence of 60-80%. Culture media was switched to huES media supplemented with 4 ng/ml Fgf2, 10 uM Y27632, 0.5 ug/ml doxcycycline at 24 h post plating and cells were fed every day. HuES like clones were picked by manually at day 27, 28, 29 post-induction with dox and characterized by immunostaining for SSEA4 and AP and teratoma assays.!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Human pancreatic ductal carcinoma cell lines PanC-1 and MIAPaCa-2 were maintained in 90% Dulbecco's Modified Essential Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and fed every other day. H1 and iPS-like clones were generally maintained in 80% DMEM /F12 supplemented with 20% KNOCKOUT serum replacement, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 0.1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, and 10 ng/ml human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Total genomic DNA was isolated from epithelial cells and iPS-like clones by proteinase K/phenol-chloroform.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = We amplified and labeled genomic DNA by using the Agilent Oligonucleotide Array-Based CGH for Genomic DNA Analysis enzymatic labeling kit (Agilent, Santa Clara CA), according to the manufacturer (briefly: 1 - add 5ml random primers to 24ul digested gDNA; 2 - incubate 95 deg 3 min; 3 - cool on ice 5 min; 4 - add digestion master mix (Agilent) to a final volume of 50 mL; 5 - incubate 37 deg 2 hrs; 6 - incubate 65 deg 10 min, then cool to 4 deg).!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Tumor-adjacent pancreas!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = tissue derivation: normal pancreas from margin of tumor!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell type: epithelial cells!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = experiment: 10!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch2 = Human ES/iPS-like clones were grown onto irradiated MEFs in 0.1% gelatinized tissue culture dishes.
