No virus particles.!Sample_description = HT-29 cells express urokinase receptors, but do not have detectable plasminogen activator activity.  There is a G -> A mutation in codon 273 of the p53 gene resulting in an Arg -> His substitution.  The p53 antigen is overproduced. The cells are negative for CD4, but there is cell surface expression of galactose ceramide (a possible alternative receptor for HIV).  The line is positive for expression of c-myc, K-ras, H-ras, N-ras. Myb, sis and fos oncogenes.  N-myc oncogene expression was not detected.!Sample_description = The stemline chromosome number is hypertriploid with the 2S component occurring at 2.4%.  Seventeen marker chromosomes are found in most metaphases, generally in single copy per chromosome. The marker designations are: M1p-(=t(3p-;?) with a deleted short arm), t(7q;?), t(10q;?), i(13q), 19q+a; M6, ?t(8q;9q-), ?Xp, M9, 6q+, t(13;?)a, t(13;?)b, 19q+b, M14, M15, 15p+, and Xq-. Chromosome 13 is nullisomic and chromosomes 8 and 14 are generally monosomic. No Y chromosome was detected by QM band analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL28!Sample_contact_name = Donna,G,Albertson!Sample_contact_email = albertson@cc.ucsf.edu!Sample_contact_phone = 415 502-8463!Sample_contact_department = Comprehensive Cancer Center!Sample_contact_institute = University of California San Francisco!Sample_contact_address =  !Sample_contact_city = San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94143!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE16!Sample_data_row_count = 2463#ID_REF = Unique row identifier, genome position order#VALUE = aka LOG2RATIO, mean of log base 2 of LINEAR_RATIO#LINEAR_RATIO = Mean of replicate Cy3/Cy5 ratios#LOG2STDDEV = Standard deviation of VALUE#NO_REPLICATES = Number of replicate spot measurements!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	LINEAR_RATIO	LOG2STDDEV	NO_REPLICATES1	-0.099883	0.933109	0.00242	32				03	0.004903	1.003404	0.024685	34	-0.094614	0.936523	0.008288	35	-0.106179	0.929045	0.026862	36	-0.044523	0.96961	0.013688	37	-0.067207	0.954484	0.003905	38	-0.03902	0.973316	0.01545	39	0.02934	1.020545	0.013603	310	-0.046171	0.968504	0.010091	311	-0.115178	0.923268	0.013619	312	0.04937	1.034813	0.053334	313	-0.089779	0.939666	0.040349	314	-0.062461	0.957629	0.006307	315	-0.081237	0.945247	0.020758	316	0.036252	1.025447	0.011829	317	-0.059232	0.959775	0.018794	318	-0.005299	0.996334	0.02633	319	0.041142	1.028928	0.045128	320	-0.083998	0.94344	0.024795	3!sample_table_end
