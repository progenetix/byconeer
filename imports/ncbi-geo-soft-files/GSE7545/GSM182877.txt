STAGING IS FOR INITIAL PRIMARY;  AT TIME OF RECURRENCE, ONE RESIDUAL AXILLARY NODE PRESENT, NEGATIVE FOR TUMOR.  INITIAL PRIMARY WAS ER+ PR+ HER2/NEU WEAK+; RECURRENCE (REPORTED IN CLINICAL DATA FOR THIS SAMPLE) IS ER- PR- HER2/NEU MODERATE+., 75-90!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = A small piece of frozen tissue was removed from a sample of frozen tissue and incubated in a proteinase K digestion solution followed by cleanup using the Qiagen M48 robotics protocol.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Following restriction enzyme digestion, biotin labeled DNA was prepared according to the Affymetrix protocol from 500ng of starting DNA (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005). The fluidics station model FS450 was used.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were hybridized according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using an Affymetrix model 640 hybridization oven.!Sample_scan_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were scanned according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using a GS3000 scanner.!Sample_description = NA!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix 500K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by dChip 2005 (Build date Nov 30, 2005) using the PM/MM difference model and invariant set normalization.  Forty-eight normal samples were downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=500k) and analyzed at the same time.  One CEL file for each set (Sty and Nsp) with the median signal intensity across the set was selected as the reference array.   The dChip-normalized signal intensities were converted to log2 ratios and segmented as follows.  For each autosomal probe set, the log2 tumor/normal ratio of each tumor sample was calculated using the average intensity for each probe set in the normal set.  For Chromosome X, the average of the 20 normal female samples was used.   Each probe set was mapped to the genome, NCBI assembly version 35, using annotation provided by the Affymetrix web site.  The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and segmented using the GLAD package for the R statistical environment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM182nnn/GSM182877/suppl/GSM182877.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM182nnn/GSM182877/suppl/GSM182877.exp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE7545!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780520	2.24752426147461SNP_A-1780618	1.69058001041412SNP_A-1780632	1.71362495422363SNP_A-1780654	1.74919176101685SNP_A-4192495	2.22740459442139SNP_A-4192498	2.25250244140625SNP_A-1780732	1.73503673076630SNP_A-1780848	2.02916622161865SNP_A-1780985	1.98802053928375SNP_A-1781022	2.05168104171753SNP_A-1781076	1.71362495422363SNP_A-1781249	2.06629037857056SNP_A-1781276	2.23176646232605SNP_A-1781302	1.70003771781921SNP_A-1781510	2.45545482635498SNP_A-4192564	2.19845819473267SNP_A-1781614	1.70003771781921SNP_A-1781633	2.01374220848083SNP_A-1781764	1.97516632080078SNP_A-1781829	2.22740459442139!sample_table_end
