The fluidics station model FS450 was used.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were hybridized according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using an Affymetrix model 640 hybridization oven.!Sample_scan_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were scanned according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using a GS3000 scanner.!Sample_description = NA!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix 500K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by dChip 2005 (Build date Nov 30, 2005) using the PM/MM difference model and invariant set normalization.  Forty-eight normal samples were downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=500k) and analyzed at the same time.  One CEL file for each set (Sty and Nsp) with the median signal intensity across the set was selected as the reference array.   The dChip-normalized signal intensities were converted to log2 ratios and segmented as follows.  For each autosomal probe set, the log2 tumor/normal ratio of each tumor sample was calculated using the average intensity for each probe set in the normal set.  For Chromosome X, the average of the 20 normal female samples was used.   Each probe set was mapped to the genome, NCBI assembly version 35, using annotation provided by the Affymetrix web site.  The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and segmented using the GLAD package for the R statistical environment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM182nnn/GSM182834/suppl/GSM182834.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM182nnn/GSM182834/suppl/GSM182834.exp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE7545!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780520	2.17881298065186SNP_A-1780618	1.75699985027313SNP_A-1780632	2.27786850929260SNP_A-1780654	1.80134928226471SNP_A-4192495	1.75979900360107SNP_A-4192498	1.73573744297028SNP_A-1780732	1.75039601325989SNP_A-1780848	1.83949911594391SNP_A-1780985	2.20238208770752SNP_A-1781022	2.2443368434906SNP_A-1781076	2.14277601242065SNP_A-1781249	1.74831914901733SNP_A-1781276	2.24785661697388SNP_A-1781302	1.65265941619873SNP_A-1781510	2.22562527656555SNP_A-4192564	3.35503959655762SNP_A-1781614	1.92673027515411SNP_A-1781633	1.69483542442322SNP_A-1781764	2.34962058067322SNP_A-1781829	2.23116207122803!sample_table_end
