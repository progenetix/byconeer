INCOMPLETE INFORMATION FOR BLOOM-RICHARDSON GRADING, AND NO REPORT ON NODAL STATUS.  TUMOR ARISES IN FIBROCYSTIC BACKGROUND., 75-90!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = A small piece of frozen tissue was removed from a sample of frozen tissue and incubated in a proteinase K digestion solution followed by cleanup using the Qiagen M48 robotics protocol.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Following restriction enzyme digestion, biotin labeled DNA was prepared according to the Affymetrix protocol from 500ng of starting DNA (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005). The fluidics station model FS450 was used.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were hybridized according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using an Affymetrix model 640 hybridization oven.!Sample_scan_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were scanned according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using a GS3000 scanner.!Sample_description = NA!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix 500K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by dChip 2005 (Build date Nov 30, 2005) using the PM/MM difference model and invariant set normalization.  Forty-eight normal samples were downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=500k) and analyzed at the same time.  One CEL file for each set (Sty and Nsp) with the median signal intensity across the set was selected as the reference array.   The dChip-normalized signal intensities were converted to log2 ratios and segmented as follows.  For each autosomal probe set, the log2 tumor/normal ratio of each tumor sample was calculated using the average intensity for each probe set in the normal set.  For Chromosome X, the average of the 20 normal female samples was used.   Each probe set was mapped to the genome, NCBI assembly version 35, using annotation provided by the Affymetrix web site.  The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and segmented using the GLAD package for the R statistical environment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM182nnn/GSM182876/suppl/GSM182876.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM182nnn/GSM182876/suppl/GSM182876.exp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE7545!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780520	2.68329524993896SNP_A-1780618	2.07591342926025SNP_A-1780632	2.66301536560059SNP_A-1780654	2.08645629882812SNP_A-4192495	1.42670953273773SNP_A-4192498	2.12297940254211SNP_A-1780732	2.09064221382141SNP_A-1780848	2.11467075347900SNP_A-1780985	2.11498904228210SNP_A-1781022	1.42772662639618SNP_A-1781076	1.41980338096619SNP_A-1781249	2.13500452041626SNP_A-1781276	2.08340930938721SNP_A-1781302	2.06960511207581SNP_A-1781510	1.42670953273773SNP_A-4192564	2.04735612869263SNP_A-1781614	2.11096024513245SNP_A-1781633	2.07133531570435SNP_A-1781764	2.11498904228210SNP_A-1781829	2.68465828895569!sample_table_end
