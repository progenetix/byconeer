RECEPTOR STATUS OF PRIMARY TUMOR NOT STATED., 75-90!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = A small piece of frozen tissue was removed from a sample of frozen tissue and incubated in a proteinase K digestion solution followed by cleanup using the Qiagen M48 robotics protocol.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Following restriction enzyme digestion, biotin labeled DNA was prepared according to the Affymetrix protocol from 500ng of starting DNA (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005). The fluidics station model FS450 was used.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were hybridized according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using an Affymetrix model 640 hybridization oven.!Sample_scan_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were scanned according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using a GS3000 scanner.!Sample_description = NA!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix 500K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by dChip 2005 (Build date Nov 30, 2005) using the PM/MM difference model and invariant set normalization.  Forty-eight normal samples were downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=500k) and analyzed at the same time.  One CEL file for each set (Sty and Nsp) with the median signal intensity across the set was selected as the reference array.   The dChip-normalized signal intensities were converted to log2 ratios and segmented as follows.  For each autosomal probe set, the log2 tumor/normal ratio of each tumor sample was calculated using the average intensity for each probe set in the normal set.  For Chromosome X, the average of the 20 normal female samples was used.   Each probe set was mapped to the genome, NCBI assembly version 35, using annotation provided by the Affymetrix web site.  The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and segmented using the GLAD package for the R statistical environment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM182nnn/GSM182881/suppl/GSM182881.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM182nnn/GSM182881/suppl/GSM182881.exp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE7545!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780520	2.05390834808350SNP_A-1780618	1.90270209312439SNP_A-1780632	1.88975608348846SNP_A-1780654	1.93594133853912SNP_A-4192495	1.9144127368927SNP_A-4192498	2.04318976402283SNP_A-1780732	2.05181694030762SNP_A-1780848	2.04031491279602SNP_A-1780985	1.89446544647217SNP_A-1781022	1.91963911056519SNP_A-1781076	1.88975608348846SNP_A-1781249	2.08142423629761SNP_A-1781276	1.90270209312439SNP_A-1781302	2.07078576087952SNP_A-1781510	1.9144127368927SNP_A-4192564	2.03943657875061SNP_A-1781614	2.07078576087952SNP_A-1781633	1.91963911056519SNP_A-1781764	1.89446544647217SNP_A-1781829	2.04510021209717!sample_table_end
