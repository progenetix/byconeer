The fluidics station model FS450 was used.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were hybridized according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using an Affymetrix model 640 hybridization oven.!Sample_scan_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were scanned according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using a GS3000 scanner.!Sample_description = NA!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix 500K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by dChip 2005 (Build date Nov 30, 2005) using the PM/MM difference model and invariant set normalization.  Forty-eight normal samples were downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=500k) and analyzed at the same time.  One CEL file for each set (Sty and Nsp) with the median signal intensity across the set was selected as the reference array.   The dChip-normalized signal intensities were converted to log2 ratios and segmented as follows.  For each autosomal probe set, the log2 tumor/normal ratio of each tumor sample was calculated using the average intensity for each probe set in the normal set.  For Chromosome X, the average of the 20 normal female samples was used.   Each probe set was mapped to the genome, NCBI assembly version 35, using annotation provided by the Affymetrix web site.  The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and segmented using the GLAD package for the R statistical environment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM182nnn/GSM182836/suppl/GSM182836.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM182nnn/GSM182836/suppl/GSM182836.exp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE7545!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780520	2.02245473861694SNP_A-1780618	1.89568603038788SNP_A-1780632	1.92878592014313SNP_A-1780654	1.96234285831451SNP_A-4192495	1.92526400089264SNP_A-4192498	1.97018909454346SNP_A-1780732	2.03525447845459SNP_A-1780848	1.94935953617096SNP_A-1780985	1.86936783790588SNP_A-1781022	3.95140552520752SNP_A-1781076	1.92878592014313SNP_A-1781249	2.07497382164001SNP_A-1781276	1.89568603038788SNP_A-1781302	2.02950811386108SNP_A-1781510	1.88028573989868SNP_A-4192564	2.00892996788025SNP_A-1781614	2.02950811386108SNP_A-1781633	1.95303666591644SNP_A-1781764	1.86936783790588SNP_A-1781829	2.11654114723206!sample_table_end
