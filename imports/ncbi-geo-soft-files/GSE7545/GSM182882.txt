SEPARATE FOCUS OF INVASIVE AND IN SITU DUCTAL CARCINOMA IS IDENTIFIED.  NOTE:  STAGE IS THAT AT TIME OF INITIAL DIAGNOSIS 2 YRS PRIOR.  TUMOR STAGING IS ACCORDING TO THE 6TH EDITION OF THE AJCC CANCER STAGING MANUAL.  INITIAL PRIMARY DIAGNOSED AS INFILTRATING DUCTAL CARCINOMA.  DONOR PREVIOUSLY TREATED WITH CHEMOTHERAPY., >90!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = A small piece of frozen tissue was removed from a sample of frozen tissue and incubated in a proteinase K digestion solution followed by cleanup using the Qiagen M48 robotics protocol.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Following restriction enzyme digestion, biotin labeled DNA was prepared according to the Affymetrix protocol from 500ng of starting DNA (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005). The fluidics station model FS450 was used.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were hybridized according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using an Affymetrix model 640 hybridization oven.!Sample_scan_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were scanned according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using a GS3000 scanner.!Sample_description = NA!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix 500K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by dChip 2005 (Build date Nov 30, 2005) using the PM/MM difference model and invariant set normalization.  Forty-eight normal samples were downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=500k) and analyzed at the same time.  One CEL file for each set (Sty and Nsp) with the median signal intensity across the set was selected as the reference array.   The dChip-normalized signal intensities were converted to log2 ratios and segmented as follows.  For each autosomal probe set, the log2 tumor/normal ratio of each tumor sample was calculated using the average intensity for each probe set in the normal set.  For Chromosome X, the average of the 20 normal female samples was used.   Each probe set was mapped to the genome, NCBI assembly version 35, using annotation provided by the Affymetrix web site.  The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and segmented using the GLAD package for the R statistical environment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM182nnn/GSM182882/suppl/GSM182882.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM182nnn/GSM182882/suppl/GSM182882.exp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE7545!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780520	1.71029019355774SNP_A-1780618	1.96849656105042SNP_A-1780632	1.88654065132141SNP_A-1780654	2.24072670936584SNP_A-4192495	1.81388032436371SNP_A-4192498	1.90191447734833SNP_A-1780732	1.67343771457672SNP_A-1780848	1.9161616563797SNP_A-1780985	2.07886385917664SNP_A-1781022	1.70351099967957SNP_A-1781076	1.88654065132141SNP_A-1781249	1.87376689910889SNP_A-1781276	1.96849656105042SNP_A-1781302	1.61490404605865SNP_A-1781510	1.81388032436371SNP_A-4192564	1.6293203830719SNP_A-1781614	3.29025030136108SNP_A-1781633	1.88276433944702SNP_A-1781764	1.51791727542877SNP_A-1781829	1.81388032436371!sample_table_end
