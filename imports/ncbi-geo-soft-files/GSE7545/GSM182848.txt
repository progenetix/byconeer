The fluidics station model FS450 was used.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were hybridized according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using an Affymetrix model 640 hybridization oven.!Sample_scan_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were scanned according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using a GS3000 scanner.!Sample_description = NA!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix 500K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by dChip 2005 (Build date Nov 30, 2005) using the PM/MM difference model and invariant set normalization.  Forty-eight normal samples were downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=500k) and analyzed at the same time.  One CEL file for each set (Sty and Nsp) with the median signal intensity across the set was selected as the reference array.   The dChip-normalized signal intensities were converted to log2 ratios and segmented as follows.  For each autosomal probe set, the log2 tumor/normal ratio of each tumor sample was calculated using the average intensity for each probe set in the normal set.  For Chromosome X, the average of the 20 normal female samples was used.   Each probe set was mapped to the genome, NCBI assembly version 35, using annotation provided by the Affymetrix web site.  The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and segmented using the GLAD package for the R statistical environment.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM182nnn/GSM182848/suppl/GSM182848.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM182nnn/GSM182848/suppl/GSM182848.exp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE7545!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780520	2.12287926673889SNP_A-1780618	1.86266994476318SNP_A-1780632	1.71064114570618SNP_A-1780654	1.72667467594147SNP_A-4192495	1.74420440196991SNP_A-4192498	2.10451936721802SNP_A-1780732	2.12558031082153SNP_A-1780848	1.73710966110229SNP_A-1780985	2.18696093559265SNP_A-1781022	2.23755383491516SNP_A-1781076	1.73135066032410SNP_A-1781249	2.20421028137207SNP_A-1781276	1.86266994476318SNP_A-1781302	2.10176157951355SNP_A-1781510	1.71088790893555SNP_A-4192564	2.00403976440430SNP_A-1781614	2.10176157951355SNP_A-1781633	2.08395266532898SNP_A-1781764	2.15928697586060SNP_A-1781829	1.71757829189301!sample_table_end
