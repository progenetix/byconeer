DNA was eluted in water and diluted to 100 nanograms/microliter.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA with was random-prime labeled using the Klenow DNA polymerase, random primers, and cyanine-labeled nucleotides. Test DNA with was labeled with cyanine-3 (Cy3) and the reference DNA was labeled with cyanine-5 (Cy5).!Sample_hyb_protocol = 150 microliters of labeled target were added to 50 microliters Cot-1 DNA, 50 microliters blocking agent.  250 microliters of 2X Hybridization Buffer was then added followed by a quick spin. The hybridization mix was denatured by placing in 98 Â°C heat block for 3 min. Then samples were transfered to 37 Â°C heat block and incubated for 30 min, followed by centrifugation for 1 min at ~18,000 g. The hybridization chambers and gasket were assembled and the entire 500 microliters were transferred for hybridization to a slide-size array. The slide was then placed at 65 Â°C in a rotating hybridization oven for 40 h at 20 rpm.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were scanned using the Agilent scanner and feature extraction software.!Sample_description = none!Sample_data_processing = The raw data were log-transformed and mode-centered.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2879!Sample_contact_name = Bianca,Durando,Lemos!Sample_contact_email = bcdl@u.washington.edu!Sample_contact_department = Medicine/Dermatology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Washington!Sample_contact_address = 815 Mercer St.!Sample_contact_city = Seattle!Sample_contact_state = WA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 98109!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM334nnn/GSM334222/suppl/gsm334222.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE13239!Sample_data_row_count = 36441#ID_REF = #VALUE = log transformed mode centered raw data!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE3334	-0.245619295	-0.198724093	-0.058329874	-0.010835829	-0.03345078	-0.211828861	-0.12427194	0.1823302	0.088728229	0.432635500	-0.228718175	0.039521988	-0.008238652	-0.089736299	0.660324397	0.0297885	0.046810801	0.0992589	0.361937296	-0.0075!sample_table_end
