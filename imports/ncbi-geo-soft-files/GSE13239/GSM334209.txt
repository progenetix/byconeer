DNA was eluted in water and diluted to 100 nanograms/microliter.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = DNA with was random-prime labeled using the Klenow DNA polymerase, random primers, and cyanine-labeled nucleotides. Test DNA with was labeled with cyanine-3 (Cy3) and the reference DNA was labeled with cyanine-5 (Cy5).!Sample_hyb_protocol = 150 microliters of labeled target were added to 50 microliters Cot-1 DNA, 50 microliters blocking agent.  250 microliters of 2X Hybridization Buffer was then added followed by a quick spin. The hybridization mix was denatured by placing in 98 Â°C heat block for 3 min. Then samples were transfered to 37 Â°C heat block and incubated for 30 min, followed by centrifugation for 1 min at ~18,000 g. The hybridization chambers and gasket were assembled and the entire 500 microliters were transferred for hybridization to a slide-size array. The slide was then placed at 65 Â°C in a rotating hybridization oven for 40 h at 20 rpm.!Sample_scan_protocol = The arrays were scanned using the Agilent scanner and feature extraction software.!Sample_description = none!Sample_data_processing = The raw data were log-transformed and mode-centered.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2879!Sample_contact_name = Bianca,Durando,Lemos!Sample_contact_email = bcdl@u.washington.edu!Sample_contact_department = Medicine/Dermatology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Washington!Sample_contact_address = 815 Mercer St.!Sample_contact_city = Seattle!Sample_contact_state = WA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 98109!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM334nnn/GSM334209/suppl/gsm334209.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE13239!Sample_data_row_count = 36441#ID_REF = #VALUE = log transformed mode centered raw data!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE3334	19295	0.712324093	0.908929874	0.816135829	0.50975078	0.918828861	0.624127194	0.9555302	1.048628229	1.368835500	0.492218175	21988	1.06238652	1.086436299	0.951324397	0.8589885	1.195510801	1.09122589	0.893537296	0.7517!sample_table_end
