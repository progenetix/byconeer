CHP files for SNP genotyping were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the Birdseed algorithm, CNVCHP files for copy number polymorphism analysis were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the Canary algorithm,  and CN5.CNCHP files were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the BRLMM-P+ algorithm. Normalization was performed using the HAPMAP270 reference provided in Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software. The array data were also processed using Birdsuite software and PICNIC software.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description - CHP file: Genotype Call Codes (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; Confidence; Signal A: signal intensity of allele A; Signal B: signal intensity of allele B!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Yan,,Shea (Xie)!Sample_contact_email = clintonrlee@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital!Sample_contact_address = Donghu Road 169#!Sample_contact_city = Whan!Sample_contact_state = Hubei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 430071!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697006/suppl/GSM697006_XY-2010-gW_1_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697006/suppl/GSM697006_XY-2010-gW_1_.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697006/suppl/GSM697006_XY-2010-gW_1_.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697006/suppl/GSM697006_XY-2010-gW_1_.canary-v1.cnvchp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28132!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.009747	AA	491.835052	195.864258SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.003909	BB	169.795471	208.556885SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001157	BB	337.100220	939.486389SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.000866	BB	215.933990	454.768402SNP_A-1978185	NC	0.102603	AA	283.908081	186.628220SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.004555	AA	482.514221	184.945999SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.005293	BB	122.032242	220.620956SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.009962	AA	546.092407	290.077057SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.009558	AB	158.447906	225.795792SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.004187	BB	233.609558	382.904785SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.003317	BB	185.027466	682.580444SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.003833	BB	297.109161	1127.091431SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.003206	AA	295.948883	141.684982SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.005546	AA	387.535217	235.359543SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.001938	BB	213.852676	304.030792SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.000393	AA	935.894409	622.295044SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.007778	AA	1733.726196	394.863007SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.006895	AA	662.634583	140.308716SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.004433	AA	1616.834839	545.945007SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.003061	AA	370.464172	102.882988!sample_table_end
