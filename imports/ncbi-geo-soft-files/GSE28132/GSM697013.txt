CHP files for SNP genotyping were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the Birdseed algorithm, CNVCHP files for copy number polymorphism analysis were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the Canary algorithm,  and CN5.CNCHP files were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the BRLMM-P+ algorithm. Normalization was performed using the HAPMAP270 reference provided in Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software. The array data were also processed using Birdsuite software and PICNIC software.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description - CHP file: Genotype Call Codes (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; Confidence; Signal A: signal intensity of allele A; Signal B: signal intensity of allele B!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Yan,,Shea (Xie)!Sample_contact_email = clintonrlee@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital!Sample_contact_address = Donghu Road 169#!Sample_contact_city = Whan!Sample_contact_state = Hubei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 430071!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697013/suppl/GSM697013_XY-2010-10C-mW.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697013/suppl/GSM697013_XY-2010-10C-mW.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697013/suppl/GSM697013_XY-2010-10C-mW.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697013/suppl/GSM697013_XY-2010-10C-mW.canary-v1.cnvchp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28132!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.001614	AA	577.451050	268.142548SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.002593	BB	166.462952	224.019287SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.010722	BB	601.105591	1953.796875SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.003383	BB	177.813263	479.267548SNP_A-1978185	NC	0.161479	AA	283.717804	191.030212SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.002252	AA	511.265076	158.273056SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.001734	BB	150.694580	338.056671SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.006051	AA	735.364075	209.727005SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.008094	AB	228.253113	251.548157SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.002915	BB	258.065430	431.498230SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.006900	BB	171.356461	412.567017SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.009583	BB	256.112518	672.372742SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.003901	AA	234.050262	110.476746SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.001489	AA	456.194153	278.435364SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.001399	BB	253.941772	349.081665SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.000109	AA	931.004150	628.459595SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.003452	AA	1680.966797	488.935730SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.003417	AA	739.538818	185.595245SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.001470	AA	1060.273926	429.709412SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.000790	AA	538.873718	155.142212!sample_table_end
