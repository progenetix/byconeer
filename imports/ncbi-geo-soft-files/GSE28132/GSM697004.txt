CHP files for SNP genotyping were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the Birdseed algorithm, CNVCHP files for copy number polymorphism analysis were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the Canary algorithm,  and CN5.CNCHP files were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the BRLMM-P+ algorithm. Normalization was performed using the HAPMAP270 reference provided in Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software. The array data were also processed using Birdsuite software and PICNIC software.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description - CHP file: Genotype Call Codes (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; Confidence; Signal A: signal intensity of allele A; Signal B: signal intensity of allele B!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Yan,,Shea (Xie)!Sample_contact_email = clintonrlee@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital!Sample_contact_address = Donghu Road 169#!Sample_contact_city = Whan!Sample_contact_state = Hubei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 430071!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697004/suppl/GSM697004_XY-2010-g2.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697004/suppl/GSM697004_XY-2010-g2.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697004/suppl/GSM697004_XY-2010-g2.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697004/suppl/GSM697004_XY-2010-g2.canary-v1.cnvchp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28132!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.005039	AA	717.895813	220.798477SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.005469	BB	161.571335	301.955017SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004502	BB	560.719238	2355.882812SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.003084	BB	194.350510	510.388916SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.001223	AA	363.615753	184.068542SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.000805	AA	537.516235	172.166000SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.002367	BB	138.977341	349.729401SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.005686	AA	681.153625	196.887268SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.004771	AB	198.515854	310.361176SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.002651	BB	304.656708	623.942322SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.001385	BB	234.406555	697.937195SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.001518	BB	376.606781	1011.665955SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.006751	AA	321.175720	109.464851SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.005326	AA	619.228882	363.663574SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.004387	BB	194.969299	335.709900SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.007906	AA	605.519958	443.510315SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.002598	AA	1647.710205	505.870972SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.000999	AA	589.674622	191.366211SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.002590	AA	1330.982300	426.031067SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.003849	AA	407.789795	160.501022!sample_table_end
