CHP files for SNP genotyping were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the Birdseed algorithm, CNVCHP files for copy number polymorphism analysis were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the Canary algorithm,  and CN5.CNCHP files were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the BRLMM-P+ algorithm. Normalization was performed using the HAPMAP270 reference provided in Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software. The array data were also processed using Birdsuite software and PICNIC software.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description - CHP file: Genotype Call Codes (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; Confidence; Signal A: signal intensity of allele A; Signal B: signal intensity of allele B!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Yan,,Shea (Xie)!Sample_contact_email = clintonrlee@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital!Sample_contact_address = Donghu Road 169#!Sample_contact_city = Whan!Sample_contact_state = Hubei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 430071!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697005/suppl/GSM697005_XY-2010-g3.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697005/suppl/GSM697005_XY-2010-g3.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697005/suppl/GSM697005_XY-2010-g3.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697005/suppl/GSM697005_XY-2010-g3.canary-v1.cnvchp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28132!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.008032	AA	871.034729	282.530060SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.010164	BB	147.476990	332.056366SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.001476	BB	441.951569	1725.181396SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.009780	BB	244.909592	754.765076SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.011036	AA	572.326721	192.851074SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.010860	AA	705.475708	200.266479SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.011601	BB	156.868469	463.730988SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.007921	AA	700.798706	271.255890SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.073426	AB	221.668610	403.631866SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.001410	BB	299.491943	466.033051SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.014027	BB	229.814606	1069.538574SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.017622	BB	357.954346	1917.341431SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.027036	AA	607.361084	177.473862SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.009611	AA	706.536011	290.075684SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.006692	BB	309.900452	439.890778SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.014326	AB	748.220581	824.902649SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.024495	AA	967.904724	490.117126SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.001704	AA	470.069916	201.135727SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.005350	AA	1265.668213	365.870117SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.002413	AA	497.651367	164.130371!sample_table_end
