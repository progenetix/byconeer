CHP files for SNP genotyping were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the Birdseed algorithm, CNVCHP files for copy number polymorphism analysis were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the Canary algorithm,  and CN5.CNCHP files were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the BRLMM-P+ algorithm. Normalization was performed using the HAPMAP270 reference provided in Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software. The array data were also processed using Birdsuite software and PICNIC software.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description - CHP file: Genotype Call Codes (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; Confidence; Signal A: signal intensity of allele A; Signal B: signal intensity of allele B!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Yan,,Shea (Xie)!Sample_contact_email = clintonrlee@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital!Sample_contact_address = Donghu Road 169#!Sample_contact_city = Whan!Sample_contact_state = Hubei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 430071!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697011/suppl/GSM697011_XY-2010-1C-mW.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697011/suppl/GSM697011_XY-2010-1C-mW.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697011/suppl/GSM697011_XY-2010-1C-mW.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697011/suppl/GSM697011_XY-2010-1C-mW.canary-v1.cnvchp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28132!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.012638	AA	517.347717	354.446625SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.001696	BB	170.067383	227.573029SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.008349	BB	137.959824	129.088074SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.002316	BB	226.494171	317.179993SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.019075	AB	286.530731	287.385193SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.006258	AB	213.946930	164.941177SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.003331	BB	131.902893	231.101776SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.004934	AA	185.996155	207.339951SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.001242	AB	228.745529	296.365265SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.006032	BB	404.058197	441.611023SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.007402	BB	183.934280	359.002167SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.004151	BB	411.688202	693.926086SNP_A-1997709	AB	0.000000	AB	192.254852	254.054794SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.007299	AA	286.415009	292.341125SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.006974	BB	189.743179	223.003876SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.009787	AA	1439.394409	794.995728SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.003863	AA	1559.345703	698.493103SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.006111	AA	905.060608	214.336838SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.010513	AA	1635.474854	658.565369SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.008509	AA	927.114258	250.616531!sample_table_end
