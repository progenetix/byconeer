CHP files for SNP genotyping were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the Birdseed algorithm, CNVCHP files for copy number polymorphism analysis were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the Canary algorithm,  and CN5.CNCHP files were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the BRLMM-P+ algorithm. Normalization was performed using the HAPMAP270 reference provided in Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software. The array data were also processed using Birdsuite software and PICNIC software.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description - CHP file: Genotype Call Codes (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; Confidence; Signal A: signal intensity of allele A; Signal B: signal intensity of allele B!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Yan,,Shea (Xie)!Sample_contact_email = clintonrlee@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital!Sample_contact_address = Donghu Road 169#!Sample_contact_city = Whan!Sample_contact_state = Hubei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 430071!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697012/suppl/GSM697012_XY-2010-5C-mW.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697012/suppl/GSM697012_XY-2010-5C-mW.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697012/suppl/GSM697012_XY-2010-5C-mW.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697012/suppl/GSM697012_XY-2010-5C-mW.canary-v1.cnvchp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28132!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.001583	AA	659.521729	247.135651SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.001774	BB	185.012100	248.142609SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.006671	BB	421.658234	2049.217285SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.003106	BB	155.861649	329.778839SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.025131	AB	171.393646	208.289963SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.008248	AA	518.440552	230.178619SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.004348	BB	163.705872	361.238678SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.001102	AA	523.080078	219.583038SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.002462	AB	262.879883	302.712555SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.000376	BB	339.292786	508.579773SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.002046	BB	205.649246	558.035217SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.003978	BB	587.954590	1058.767090SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.005399	AA	223.784500	135.797943SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.003399	AA	385.762024	264.867859SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.007117	BB	266.585022	441.238800SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.004904	AA	1122.881592	756.885864SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.002168	AA	1500.395386	664.925354SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.008608	AA	577.850220	293.423950SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.001135	AA	1303.034058	461.556519SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.007661	AA	447.765900	85.409592!sample_table_end
