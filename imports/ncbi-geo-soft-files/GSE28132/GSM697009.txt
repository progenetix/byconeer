CHP files for SNP genotyping were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the Birdseed algorithm, CNVCHP files for copy number polymorphism analysis were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the Canary algorithm,  and CN5.CNCHP files were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the BRLMM-P+ algorithm. Normalization was performed using the HAPMAP270 reference provided in Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software. The array data were also processed using Birdsuite software and PICNIC software.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description - CHP file: Genotype Call Codes (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; Confidence; Signal A: signal intensity of allele A; Signal B: signal intensity of allele B!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Yan,,Shea (Xie)!Sample_contact_email = clintonrlee@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital!Sample_contact_address = Donghu Road 169#!Sample_contact_city = Whan!Sample_contact_state = Hubei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 430071!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697009/suppl/GSM697009_XY-2010-1C_2_-W.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697009/suppl/GSM697009_XY-2010-1C_2_-W.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697009/suppl/GSM697009_XY-2010-1C_2_-W.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697009/suppl/GSM697009_XY-2010-1C_2_-W.canary-v1.cnvchp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28132!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.005421	AA	784.869690	312.478180SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.012398	BB	230.801208	185.127151SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.005844	BB	178.121658	192.996964SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.007696	BB	217.143921	156.725677SNP_A-1978185	NC	0.111603	AB	297.589783	326.960419SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.003515	AB	317.505707	390.868835SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.003712	BB	137.991058	217.143921SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.005264	AA	213.470352	245.845474SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.004475	AB	303.319275	346.667572SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.017708	BB	440.949524	413.039093SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.002858	BB	290.883270	519.176453SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.004932	BB	614.680481	953.538696SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.002584	AA	264.021515	115.540039SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.003530	AA	573.325073	352.937469SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.045999	BB	324.568329	317.979767SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.018275	AB	426.140686	894.943481SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.002402	AB	958.310852	1198.944336SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.007230	AA	242.238007	195.732803SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.008541	AA	499.618317	437.210785SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.002865	AA	197.915543	101.246552!sample_table_end
