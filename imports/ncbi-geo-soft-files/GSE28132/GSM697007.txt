CHP files for SNP genotyping were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the Birdseed algorithm, CNVCHP files for copy number polymorphism analysis were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the Canary algorithm,  and CN5.CNCHP files were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the BRLMM-P+ algorithm. Normalization was performed using the HAPMAP270 reference provided in Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software. The array data were also processed using Birdsuite software and PICNIC software.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description - CHP file: Genotype Call Codes (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; Confidence; Signal A: signal intensity of allele A; Signal B: signal intensity of allele B!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Yan,,Shea (Xie)!Sample_contact_email = clintonrlee@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital!Sample_contact_address = Donghu Road 169#!Sample_contact_city = Whan!Sample_contact_state = Hubei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 430071!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697007/suppl/GSM697007_XY-2010-gW_2_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697007/suppl/GSM697007_XY-2010-gW_2_.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697007/suppl/GSM697007_XY-2010-gW_2_.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697007/suppl/GSM697007_XY-2010-gW_2_.canary-v1.cnvchp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28132!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.002996	AA	548.187134	246.296173SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.008436	BB	144.117813	222.984177SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004668	BB	481.218292	2200.396729SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.001289	BB	197.332245	365.570801SNP_A-1978185	NC	0.348343	AB	209.179520	191.360596SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.002343	AA	524.308777	153.086319SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.001618	BB	132.533890	282.976776SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.003756	AA	525.702148	189.950516SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.008459	AB	157.965363	244.247910SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.004750	BB	220.389847	447.740295SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.000074	BB	241.316589	611.667480SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.001588	BB	374.913727	1004.318665SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.000853	AA	285.381836	123.995911SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.008303	AA	486.580200	214.493484SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.001888	BB	229.184830	341.052429SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.005416	AA	720.415039	632.493713SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.001271	AA	1433.799805	584.401611SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.001910	AA	706.337463	200.350967SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.002312	AA	1061.138428	406.297638SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.005204	AA	546.005127	108.816940!sample_table_end
