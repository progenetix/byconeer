CHP files for SNP genotyping were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the Birdseed algorithm, CNVCHP files for copy number polymorphism analysis were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the Canary algorithm,  and CN5.CNCHP files were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the BRLMM-P+ algorithm. Normalization was performed using the HAPMAP270 reference provided in Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software. The array data were also processed using Birdsuite software and PICNIC software.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description - CHP file: Genotype Call Codes (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; Confidence; Signal A: signal intensity of allele A; Signal B: signal intensity of allele B!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Yan,,Shea (Xie)!Sample_contact_email = clintonrlee@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital!Sample_contact_address = Donghu Road 169#!Sample_contact_city = Whan!Sample_contact_state = Hubei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 430071!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697008/suppl/GSM697008_XY-2010-1C_1_-W.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697008/suppl/GSM697008_XY-2010-1C_1_-W.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697008/suppl/GSM697008_XY-2010-1C_1_-W.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697008/suppl/GSM697008_XY-2010-1C_1_-W.canary-v1.cnvchp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28132!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.004006	AA	506.009399	268.718384SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.003314	BB	153.544724	244.237350SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.004027	BB	281.398651	405.050079SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.021099	BB	474.655151	749.875916SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.006393	AB	250.932571	248.184967SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.003969	AB	215.632874	218.813416SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.003178	BB	125.374901	262.819916SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.005800	AA	161.572052	234.718491SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.013578	AB	341.659119	325.351349SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.020515	BB	518.497314	1081.810547SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.005082	BB	323.628235	607.123047SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.003134	BB	568.527588	976.786560SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.006071	AA	237.925095	140.442657SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.009392	AA	361.509308	370.138367SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.017402	BB	155.611603	159.297882SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.006861	AB	1104.470215	1047.801270SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.013728	AA	1473.856201	858.689758SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.010973	AA	815.374023	312.740967SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.005006	AA	1629.755615	563.146057SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.019465	AA	1996.485107	329.632355!sample_table_end
