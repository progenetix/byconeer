CHP files for SNP genotyping were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the Birdseed algorithm, CNVCHP files for copy number polymorphism analysis were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the Canary algorithm,  and CN5.CNCHP files were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the BRLMM-P+ algorithm. Normalization was performed using the HAPMAP270 reference provided in Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software. The array data were also processed using Birdsuite software and PICNIC software.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description - CHP file: Genotype Call Codes (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; Confidence; Signal A: signal intensity of allele A; Signal B: signal intensity of allele B!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Yan,,Shea (Xie)!Sample_contact_email = clintonrlee@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital!Sample_contact_address = Donghu Road 169#!Sample_contact_city = Whan!Sample_contact_state = Hubei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 430071!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697003/suppl/GSM697003_XY-2010-g1.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697003/suppl/GSM697003_XY-2010-g1.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697003/suppl/GSM697003_XY-2010-g1.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697003/suppl/GSM697003_XY-2010-g1.canary-v1.cnvchp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28132!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.004423	AA	788.839172	256.390442SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.004356	BB	179.443680	279.844971SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.002880	BB	504.812958	2075.524414SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.000765	BB	221.811554	462.901672SNP_A-1978185	AA	0.006711	AA	368.347412	156.330200SNP_A-4264431	AA	0.004273	AA	620.406799	169.909790SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.003420	BB	127.061836	333.685486SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.007539	AA	331.919678	165.478638SNP_A-4265735	NC	0.163659	AB	191.372894	388.605286SNP_A-1995832	BB	0.003326	BB	275.581085	597.363098SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.002176	BB	223.619431	733.396057SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.001973	BB	368.825836	1179.568604SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.007394	AA	337.315765	110.296249SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.003217	AA	565.418091	350.261139SNP_A-1997922	BB	0.001693	BB	218.567123	305.150696SNP_A-2000230	AA	0.004205	AA	689.058044	503.709839SNP_A-2000332	AA	0.002813	AA	1693.771729	562.507812SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.001056	AA	647.119080	199.057510SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.004685	AA	1079.195679	360.617737SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.000932	AA	676.890320	156.385239!sample_table_end
