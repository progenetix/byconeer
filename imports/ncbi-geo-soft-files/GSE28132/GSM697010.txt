CHP files for SNP genotyping were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the Birdseed algorithm, CNVCHP files for copy number polymorphism analysis were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the Canary algorithm,  and CN5.CNCHP files were generated by Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software using the BRLMM-P+ algorithm. Normalization was performed using the HAPMAP270 reference provided in Affymetrix Genotyping Consle software. The array data were also processed using Birdsuite software and PICNIC software.!Sample_data_processing = primary data description - CHP file: Genotype Call Codes (SNP call): AA, AB, BB, NC, and NoCall; Confidence; Signal A: signal intensity of allele A; Signal B: signal intensity of allele B!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Yan,,Shea (Xie)!Sample_contact_email = clintonrlee@gmail.com!Sample_contact_institute = Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital!Sample_contact_address = Donghu Road 169#!Sample_contact_city = Whan!Sample_contact_state = Hubei!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 430071!Sample_contact_country = China!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697010/suppl/GSM697010_XY-2010-1C_3_-W.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697010/suppl/GSM697010_XY-2010-1C_3_-W.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697010/suppl/GSM697010_XY-2010-1C_3_-W.birdseed.chp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM697nnn/GSM697010/suppl/GSM697010_XY-2010-1C_3_-W.canary-v1.cnvchp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE28132!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = PROBE SET NAME#VALUE = CALL#CONFIDENCE = #FORCED CALL = #SIGNAL A = #SIGNAL B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CONFIDENCE	FORCED CALL	SIGNAL A	SIGNAL BSNP_A-2131660	AA	0.003775	AA	656.968140	317.156219SNP_A-1967418	BB	0.006305	BB	213.179291	194.140808SNP_A-1969580	BB	0.010585	BB	327.991028	290.737244SNP_A-4263484	BB	0.005320	BB	223.815659	219.405823SNP_A-1978185	AB	0.026435	AB	264.783783	282.825775SNP_A-4264431	AB	0.007117	AB	378.201538	417.011627SNP_A-1980898	BB	0.019012	BB	194.039032	215.304749SNP_A-1983139	AA	0.002205	AA	303.975555	228.211655SNP_A-4265735	AB	0.004538	AB	290.272583	371.822784SNP_A-1995832	NC	0.131115	BB	460.441956	254.073517SNP_A-1995893	BB	0.013144	BB	376.725311	422.846771SNP_A-1997689	BB	0.007914	BB	665.240845	830.074219SNP_A-1997709	AA	0.002976	AA	235.725723	129.600952SNP_A-1997896	AA	0.002174	AA	546.571533	338.022034SNP_A-1997922	NC	0.486410	BB	344.972260	288.380707SNP_A-2000230	AB	0.010992	AB	532.224976	931.620483SNP_A-2000332	AB	0.002475	AB	1077.697388	1090.950073SNP_A-2000337	AA	0.009295	AA	183.041245	161.738998SNP_A-2000342	AA	0.013052	AA	567.591309	557.962891SNP_A-4268173	AA	0.004203	AA	222.861633	130.809952!sample_table_end
