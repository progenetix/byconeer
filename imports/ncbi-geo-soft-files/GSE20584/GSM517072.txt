These data were normalized using a method first described for  Illumina genotyping arrays. Specifically, we followed an adaptation of the Illumina  method adapted for Affymetrix arrays normalization protocol implemented in the  PennCNV package  (http://www.openbioinformatics.org/penncnv/penncnv_tutorial_affy_gw6.html) to obtain  normalized B-allele Frequency (BAF) and LogR Ratio (LRR) values for each probeset.  BAF represents the raw proportion of signal coming from allele B (Theta) normalized  using Theta values from a pool of normal samples with pre-determined AA, AB, or BB  genotypes at that probe position. LRR represents the log of the ration of the total signal  from A and B alleles for a sample divided by expected total signal from a pool of normal  samples given the same value of Theta. In brief, the raw intensity values (CEL files) were processed to obtain normalized allele-specific values for each probe using the Affymetrix Power Tools version 1.10  (http://www.affymetrix.com/partners_programs/programs/developer/tools/powertools.affx#1_1) tools apt-probeset-genotype and apt-probeset-summarize. A reference probe-intensity distribution obtained from the HapMap project samples was used for the  quantile normalization step. BAF and LRR values were calculated with the script  ânormalize_affy_geno_cluster.plâ from the PennCVN-Affy package. This script  additionally implements a correction for GC-content bias in the LRR values. Data from  the HapMap project were used for the reference clusters of AA, AB, and BB genotype  signal intensity values. LRR values for somatic CNVs were calculated as the difference of the Tumor and Normal LRR values.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM517nnn/GSM517072/suppl/GSM517072.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE20584!Sample_series_id = GSE20585!Sample_data_row_count = 1851567#ID_REF = #VALUE = B-Allele Frequency (BAF)#LRR = Log-R Ratio (LRR) values!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	LRRCN_473963	2	-0.3773CN_473964	2	-0.2376CN_473965	2	-0.2129CN_477984	2	-0.4394CN_473981	2	0.4107CN_473982	2	-0.1682CN_497980	2	-0.2327CN_497981	2	0.0113CN_513369	2	-0.2716CN_513370	2	0.0641CN_517762	2	-0.2496CN_517763	2	0.1692CN_502615	2	-0.4286CN_502613	2	0.3107CN_502614	2	-0.0639CN_502616	2	-0.817CN_502842	2	0.4992CN_502843	2	0.1075CN_466171	2	0.4914CN_466172	2	0.2078!sample_table_end
