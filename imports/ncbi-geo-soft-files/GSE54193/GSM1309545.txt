Copy number estimates were calculated in Partek against a reference baseline consisting of 90 female CEPH samples. Copy number segmentation was performed by Parteks Genomic segmentation tool with a minumum number of markers of 20. Threshold for calling gains and losses set to -0.25 < 2 > +25. Signal to noise 0.45.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Marcel,,Smid!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Erasmus MC!Sample_contact_address = Dr. Molewaterplein 50!Sample_contact_city = Rotterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 2040, 3000CA!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1309nnn/GSM1309545/suppl/GSM1309545_EA06018_0214-04C_Nsp250_VER839_PCRN.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE54193!Sample_series_id = GSE54219!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Copy number estimates per SNP!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	4.13375SNP_A-1780272	1.70755SNP_A-1780285	1.96274SNP_A-1780286	1.0915SNP_A-1780287	2.32839SNP_A-1780289	1.72523SNP_A-1780292	2.37188SNP_A-1780294	2.19139SNP_A-1780295	1.51748SNP_A-1780300	1.79535SNP_A-1780302	3.43094SNP_A-1780303	1.46104SNP_A-1780304	1.9036SNP_A-1780305	2.07526SNP_A-1780311	2.23491SNP_A-1780312	2.28769SNP_A-1780313	1.4492SNP_A-1780316	1.58864SNP_A-1780318	1.69333SNP_A-1780320	3.16002!sample_table_end
