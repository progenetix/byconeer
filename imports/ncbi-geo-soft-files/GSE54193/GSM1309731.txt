Copy number estimates were calculated in Partek against a reference baseline consisting of 90 female CEPH samples. Copy number segmentation was performed by Parteks Genomic segmentation tool with a minumum number of markers of 20. Threshold for calling gains and losses set to -0.25 < 2 > +25. Signal to noise 0.45.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Marcel,,Smid!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Erasmus MC!Sample_contact_address = Dr. Molewaterplein 50!Sample_contact_city = Rotterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 2040, 3000CA!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1309nnn/GSM1309731/suppl/GSM1309731_EA06018_0251-03D_Sty250_2883_PCRS.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE54193!Sample_series_id = GSE54219!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #VALUE = Copy number estimates per SNP!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780271	0.953806SNP_A-1780274	1.742SNP_A-1780277	1.29345SNP_A-1780278	0.889876SNP_A-1780283	0.901529SNP_A-1780290	2.28418SNP_A-1780293	4.57908SNP_A-1780299	2.64492SNP_A-1780301	2.11391SNP_A-1780310	1.59773SNP_A-1780315	1.35194SNP_A-1780317	4.26543SNP_A-1780319	1.86832SNP_A-1780324	1.78077SNP_A-1780325	2.91005SNP_A-1780328	2.83183SNP_A-1780333	1.51633SNP_A-1780335	1.52622SNP_A-1780339	2.34218SNP_A-1780340	1.7574!sample_table_end
