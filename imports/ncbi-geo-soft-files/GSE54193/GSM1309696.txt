Copy number estimates were calculated in Partek against a reference baseline consisting of 90 female CEPH samples. Copy number segmentation was performed by Parteks Genomic segmentation tool with a minumum number of markers of 20. Threshold for calling gains and losses set to -0.25 < 2 > +25. Signal to noise 0.45.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Marcel,,Smid!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Erasmus MC!Sample_contact_address = Dr. Molewaterplein 50!Sample_contact_city = Rotterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 2040, 3000CA!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1309nnn/GSM1309696/suppl/GSM1309696_EA06018_0251-06A_Sty250_1642_PCRS.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE54193!Sample_series_id = GSE54219!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #VALUE = Copy number estimates per SNP!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780271	1.20277SNP_A-1780274	1.52644SNP_A-1780277	1.6515SNP_A-1780278	0.90386SNP_A-1780283	0.999256SNP_A-1780290	2.28679SNP_A-1780293	5.22158SNP_A-1780299	2.63706SNP_A-1780301	2.05967SNP_A-1780310	1.42528SNP_A-1780315	1.78068SNP_A-1780317	4.17638SNP_A-1780319	2.22452SNP_A-1780324	2.68265SNP_A-1780325	2.67091SNP_A-1780328	1.90343SNP_A-1780333	2.30376SNP_A-1780335	1.31747SNP_A-1780339	3.45623SNP_A-1780340	1.59726!sample_table_end
