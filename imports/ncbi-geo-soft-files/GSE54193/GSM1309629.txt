Copy number estimates were calculated in Partek against a reference baseline consisting of 90 female CEPH samples. Copy number segmentation was performed by Parteks Genomic segmentation tool with a minumum number of markers of 20. Threshold for calling gains and losses set to -0.25 < 2 > +25. Signal to noise 0.45.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Marcel,,Smid!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Erasmus MC!Sample_contact_address = Dr. Molewaterplein 50!Sample_contact_city = Rotterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 2040, 3000CA!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1309nnn/GSM1309629/suppl/GSM1309629_EA06018_0214-12E_Nsp250_VER4110_PCRN.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE54193!Sample_series_id = GSE54219!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Copy number estimates per SNP!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	2.6769SNP_A-1780272	1.61543SNP_A-1780285	1.31964SNP_A-1780286	0.959258SNP_A-1780287	1.9592SNP_A-1780289	2.21716SNP_A-1780292	1.96624SNP_A-1780294	1.8647SNP_A-1780295	1.31465SNP_A-1780300	1.51441SNP_A-1780302	3.3854SNP_A-1780303	1.56871SNP_A-1780304	1.55427SNP_A-1780305	1.91008SNP_A-1780311	2.36068SNP_A-1780312	1.74273SNP_A-1780313	1.88383SNP_A-1780316	1.87451SNP_A-1780318	1.45115SNP_A-1780320	2.59696!sample_table_end
