Copy number estimates were calculated in Partek against a reference baseline consisting of 90 female CEPH samples. Copy number segmentation was performed by Parteks Genomic segmentation tool with a minumum number of markers of 20. Threshold for calling gains and losses set to -0.25 < 2 > +25. Signal to noise 0.45.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Marcel,,Smid!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Erasmus MC!Sample_contact_address = Dr. Molewaterplein 50!Sample_contact_city = Rotterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 2040, 3000CA!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1309nnn/GSM1309541/suppl/GSM1309541_EA06018_0214-03H_Nsp250_VER255_PCRN.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE54193!Sample_series_id = GSE54219!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Copy number estimates per SNP!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	2.31788SNP_A-1780272	1.45648SNP_A-1780285	2.45491SNP_A-1780286	0.915549SNP_A-1780287	2.22032SNP_A-1780289	1.83397SNP_A-1780292	2.34293SNP_A-1780294	1.97593SNP_A-1780295	1.91784SNP_A-1780300	2.24563SNP_A-1780302	5.77606SNP_A-1780303	1.50817SNP_A-1780304	1.72122SNP_A-1780305	1.72546SNP_A-1780311	1.95814SNP_A-1780312	1.22836SNP_A-1780313	2.37774SNP_A-1780316	1.75859SNP_A-1780318	1.78983SNP_A-1780320	3.03571!sample_table_end
