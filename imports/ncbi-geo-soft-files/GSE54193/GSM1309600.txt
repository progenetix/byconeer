Copy number estimates were calculated in Partek against a reference baseline consisting of 90 female CEPH samples. Copy number segmentation was performed by Parteks Genomic segmentation tool with a minumum number of markers of 20. Threshold for calling gains and losses set to -0.25 < 2 > +25. Signal to noise 0.45.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Marcel,,Smid!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Erasmus MC!Sample_contact_address = Dr. Molewaterplein 50!Sample_contact_city = Rotterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 2040, 3000CA!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1309nnn/GSM1309600/suppl/GSM1309600_EA06018_0214-07A_Nsp250_VER2268_PCRN.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE54193!Sample_series_id = GSE54219!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Copy number estimates per SNP!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	3.71814SNP_A-1780272	2.4316SNP_A-1780285	2.28289SNP_A-1780286	1.83995SNP_A-1780287	2.65536SNP_A-1780289	1.96353SNP_A-1780292	1.77058SNP_A-1780294	2.28431SNP_A-1780295	2.01143SNP_A-1780300	1.77573SNP_A-1780302	2.81285SNP_A-1780303	1.41624SNP_A-1780304	2.52476SNP_A-1780305	1.77942SNP_A-1780311	2.32678SNP_A-1780312	1.78894SNP_A-1780313	1.73094SNP_A-1780316	1.95897SNP_A-1780318	1.51834SNP_A-1780320	2.88307!sample_table_end
