Copy number estimates were calculated in Partek against a reference baseline consisting of 90 female CEPH samples. Copy number segmentation was performed by Parteks Genomic segmentation tool with a minumum number of markers of 20. Threshold for calling gains and losses set to -0.25 < 2 > +25. Signal to noise 0.45.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Marcel,,Smid!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Erasmus MC!Sample_contact_address = Dr. Molewaterplein 50!Sample_contact_city = Rotterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 2040, 3000CA!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1309nnn/GSM1309608/suppl/GSM1309608_EA06018_0214-09C_Nsp250_VER2878_PCRN_2.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE54193!Sample_series_id = GSE54219!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Copy number estimates per SNP!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	3.64066SNP_A-1780272	2.55555SNP_A-1780285	2.67359SNP_A-1780286	1.79424SNP_A-1780287	1.8881SNP_A-1780289	2.21817SNP_A-1780292	2.34092SNP_A-1780294	1.83205SNP_A-1780295	1.52578SNP_A-1780300	2.53571SNP_A-1780302	4.47152SNP_A-1780303	1.6663SNP_A-1780304	2.26738SNP_A-1780305	2.12365SNP_A-1780311	2.63264SNP_A-1780312	2.06953SNP_A-1780313	2.39584SNP_A-1780316	1.72691SNP_A-1780318	1.93051SNP_A-1780320	2.24549!sample_table_end
