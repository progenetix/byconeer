Copy number estimates were calculated in Partek against a reference baseline consisting of 90 female CEPH samples. Copy number segmentation was performed by Parteks Genomic segmentation tool with a minumum number of markers of 20. Threshold for calling gains and losses set to -0.25 < 2 > +25. Signal to noise 0.45.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Marcel,,Smid!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Erasmus MC!Sample_contact_address = Dr. Molewaterplein 50!Sample_contact_city = Rotterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 2040, 3000CA!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1309nnn/GSM1309758/suppl/GSM1309758_EA06018_0253-01E_Sty250_4126_PCRS.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE54193!Sample_series_id = GSE54219!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #VALUE = Copy number estimates per SNP!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780271	1.25693SNP_A-1780274	1.31899SNP_A-1780277	1.55955SNP_A-1780278	0.801854SNP_A-1780283	0.947294SNP_A-1780290	2.1021SNP_A-1780293	4.36791SNP_A-1780299	2.94654SNP_A-1780301	1.71624SNP_A-1780310	1.58485SNP_A-1780315	1.69595SNP_A-1780317	4.14202SNP_A-1780319	2.41716SNP_A-1780324	2.28631SNP_A-1780325	4.02008SNP_A-1780328	1.85142SNP_A-1780333	2.09845SNP_A-1780335	1.10671SNP_A-1780339	3.5946SNP_A-1780340	1.57925!sample_table_end
