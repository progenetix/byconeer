Copy number estimates were calculated in Partek against a reference baseline consisting of 90 female CEPH samples. Copy number segmentation was performed by Parteks Genomic segmentation tool with a minumum number of markers of 20. Threshold for calling gains and losses set to -0.25 < 2 > +25. Signal to noise 0.45.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Marcel,,Smid!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Erasmus MC!Sample_contact_address = Dr. Molewaterplein 50!Sample_contact_city = Rotterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 2040, 3000CA!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1309nnn/GSM1309604/suppl/GSM1309604_EA06018_0216-05E_Nsp250_VER2676_PCRN.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE54193!Sample_series_id = GSE54219!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Copy number estimates per SNP!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	2.63018SNP_A-1780272	2.53963SNP_A-1780285	1.9098SNP_A-1780286	1.36995SNP_A-1780287	2.68743SNP_A-1780289	1.8981SNP_A-1780292	2.24661SNP_A-1780294	2.80886SNP_A-1780295	1.91529SNP_A-1780300	1.8876SNP_A-1780302	3.59145SNP_A-1780303	1.52514SNP_A-1780304	3.74942SNP_A-1780305	1.80146SNP_A-1780311	1.96287SNP_A-1780312	2.14274SNP_A-1780313	2.06422SNP_A-1780316	2.42037SNP_A-1780318	1.93442SNP_A-1780320	3.34628!sample_table_end
