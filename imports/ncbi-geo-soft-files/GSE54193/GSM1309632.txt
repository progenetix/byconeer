Copy number estimates were calculated in Partek against a reference baseline consisting of 90 female CEPH samples. Copy number segmentation was performed by Parteks Genomic segmentation tool with a minumum number of markers of 20. Threshold for calling gains and losses set to -0.25 < 2 > +25. Signal to noise 0.45.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Marcel,,Smid!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Erasmus MC!Sample_contact_address = Dr. Molewaterplein 50!Sample_contact_city = Rotterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 2040, 3000CA!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1309nnn/GSM1309632/suppl/GSM1309632_EA06018_0216-01B_Nsp250_VER4116_PCRN.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE54193!Sample_series_id = GSE54219!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Copy number estimates per SNP!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	3.04351SNP_A-1780272	2.47392SNP_A-1780285	2.07444SNP_A-1780286	1.2902SNP_A-1780287	2.45217SNP_A-1780289	2.28741SNP_A-1780292	2.46354SNP_A-1780294	2.03021SNP_A-1780295	2.46933SNP_A-1780300	2.81155SNP_A-1780302	1.50165SNP_A-1780303	1.939SNP_A-1780304	2.6871SNP_A-1780305	1.6677SNP_A-1780311	2.06909SNP_A-1780312	1.84706SNP_A-1780313	2.08109SNP_A-1780316	2.67265SNP_A-1780318	1.56144SNP_A-1780320	2.5362!sample_table_end
