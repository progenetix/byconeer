Copy number estimates were calculated in Partek against a reference baseline consisting of 90 female CEPH samples. Copy number segmentation was performed by Parteks Genomic segmentation tool with a minumum number of markers of 20. Threshold for calling gains and losses set to -0.25 < 2 > +25. Signal to noise 0.45.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Marcel,,Smid!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Erasmus MC!Sample_contact_address = Dr. Molewaterplein 50!Sample_contact_city = Rotterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 2040, 3000CA!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1309nnn/GSM1309772/suppl/GSM1309772_EA06018_0253-07D_Sty250_4161_PCRS.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE54193!Sample_series_id = GSE54219!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #VALUE = Copy number estimates per SNP!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780271	1.44198SNP_A-1780274	1.7573SNP_A-1780277	2.21628SNP_A-1780278	1.11781SNP_A-1780283	1.12111SNP_A-1780290	2.87172SNP_A-1780293	5.53228SNP_A-1780299	3.10365SNP_A-1780301	1.54489SNP_A-1780310	0.904585SNP_A-1780315	1.40363SNP_A-1780317	3.11015SNP_A-1780319	2.13302SNP_A-1780324	2.81438SNP_A-1780325	2.19106SNP_A-1780328	1.63722SNP_A-1780333	1.88481SNP_A-1780335	1.49115SNP_A-1780339	3.17569SNP_A-1780340	1.36577!sample_table_end
