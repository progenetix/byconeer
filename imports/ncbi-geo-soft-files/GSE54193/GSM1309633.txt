Copy number estimates were calculated in Partek against a reference baseline consisting of 90 female CEPH samples. Copy number segmentation was performed by Parteks Genomic segmentation tool with a minumum number of markers of 20. Threshold for calling gains and losses set to -0.25 < 2 > +25. Signal to noise 0.45.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Marcel,,Smid!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Erasmus MC!Sample_contact_address = Dr. Molewaterplein 50!Sample_contact_city = Rotterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 2040, 3000CA!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1309nnn/GSM1309633/suppl/GSM1309633_EA06018_0216-01C_Nsp250_VER4118_PCRN.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE54193!Sample_series_id = GSE54219!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Copy number estimates per SNP!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	2.33049SNP_A-1780272	1.82988SNP_A-1780285	1.94862SNP_A-1780286	0.921071SNP_A-1780287	1.43138SNP_A-1780289	2.37324SNP_A-1780292	2.88899SNP_A-1780294	1.29818SNP_A-1780295	2.50843SNP_A-1780300	1.59088SNP_A-1780302	2.14581SNP_A-1780303	1.53368SNP_A-1780304	2.70988SNP_A-1780305	1.75238SNP_A-1780311	1.95208SNP_A-1780312	2.06451SNP_A-1780313	1.71333SNP_A-1780316	2.7927SNP_A-1780318	1.38655SNP_A-1780320	3.86266!sample_table_end
