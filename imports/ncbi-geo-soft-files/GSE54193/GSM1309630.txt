Copy number estimates were calculated in Partek against a reference baseline consisting of 90 female CEPH samples. Copy number segmentation was performed by Parteks Genomic segmentation tool with a minumum number of markers of 20. Threshold for calling gains and losses set to -0.25 < 2 > +25. Signal to noise 0.45.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Marcel,,Smid!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Erasmus MC!Sample_contact_address = Dr. Molewaterplein 50!Sample_contact_city = Rotterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 2040, 3000CA!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1309nnn/GSM1309630/suppl/GSM1309630_EA06018_0214-12F_Nsp250_VER4113_PCRN.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE54193!Sample_series_id = GSE54219!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Copy number estimates per SNP!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	3.65479SNP_A-1780272	1.3049SNP_A-1780285	1.49524SNP_A-1780286	1.0838SNP_A-1780287	3.09407SNP_A-1780289	1.38518SNP_A-1780292	2.25887SNP_A-1780294	1.70462SNP_A-1780295	1.52894SNP_A-1780300	1.93214SNP_A-1780302	2.21802SNP_A-1780303	2.3719SNP_A-1780304	1.71533SNP_A-1780305	1.84418SNP_A-1780311	2.0102SNP_A-1780312	2.3014SNP_A-1780313	2.0648SNP_A-1780316	1.20848SNP_A-1780318	1.43927SNP_A-1780320	6.312!sample_table_end
