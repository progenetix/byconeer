Copy number estimates were calculated in Partek against a reference baseline consisting of 90 female CEPH samples. Copy number segmentation was performed by Parteks Genomic segmentation tool with a minumum number of markers of 20. Threshold for calling gains and losses set to -0.25 < 2 > +25. Signal to noise 0.45.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Marcel,,Smid!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Erasmus MC!Sample_contact_address = Dr. Molewaterplein 50!Sample_contact_city = Rotterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 2040, 3000CA!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1309nnn/GSM1309635/suppl/GSM1309635_EA06018_0216-01E_Nsp250_VER4122_PCRN.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE54193!Sample_series_id = GSE54219!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Copy number estimates per SNP!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	2.50132SNP_A-1780272	1.8513SNP_A-1780285	1.6836SNP_A-1780286	1.06669SNP_A-1780287	2.24165SNP_A-1780289	2.12002SNP_A-1780292	1.50803SNP_A-1780294	2.39323SNP_A-1780295	2.42568SNP_A-1780300	1.83729SNP_A-1780302	1.31285SNP_A-1780303	1.95256SNP_A-1780304	1.79288SNP_A-1780305	2.24872SNP_A-1780311	2.66606SNP_A-1780312	2.91954SNP_A-1780313	1.57003SNP_A-1780316	1.80201SNP_A-1780318	1.74773SNP_A-1780320	2.38431!sample_table_end
