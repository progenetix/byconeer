Copy number estimates were calculated in Partek against a reference baseline consisting of 90 female CEPH samples. Copy number segmentation was performed by Parteks Genomic segmentation tool with a minumum number of markers of 20. Threshold for calling gains and losses set to -0.25 < 2 > +25. Signal to noise 0.45.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Marcel,,Smid!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Erasmus MC!Sample_contact_address = Dr. Molewaterplein 50!Sample_contact_city = Rotterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 2040, 3000CA!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1309nnn/GSM1309561/suppl/GSM1309561_EA06018_0216-05B_Nsp250_VER951_PCRN.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE54193!Sample_series_id = GSE54219!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Copy number estimates per SNP!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	1.75114SNP_A-1780272	0.893189SNP_A-1780285	2.10943SNP_A-1780286	1.40511SNP_A-1780287	2.49875SNP_A-1780289	1.80802SNP_A-1780292	2.24355SNP_A-1780294	2.05588SNP_A-1780295	1.40536SNP_A-1780300	3.00948SNP_A-1780302	2.26892SNP_A-1780303	1.32592SNP_A-1780304	1.441SNP_A-1780305	1.09405SNP_A-1780311	2.61828SNP_A-1780312	2.87792SNP_A-1780313	2.20544SNP_A-1780316	1.35714SNP_A-1780318	1.89924SNP_A-1780320	2.22393!sample_table_end
