Copy number estimates were calculated in Partek against a reference baseline consisting of 90 female CEPH samples. Copy number segmentation was performed by Parteks Genomic segmentation tool with a minumum number of markers of 20. Threshold for calling gains and losses set to -0.25 < 2 > +25. Signal to noise 0.45.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Marcel,,Smid!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Erasmus MC!Sample_contact_address = Dr. Molewaterplein 50!Sample_contact_city = Rotterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 2040, 3000CA!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1309nnn/GSM1309552/suppl/GSM1309552_EA06018_0214-04F_Nsp250_VER930_PCRN.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE54193!Sample_series_id = GSE54219!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Copy number estimates per SNP!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	5.0219SNP_A-1780272	2.33843SNP_A-1780285	2.36437SNP_A-1780286	0.607368SNP_A-1780287	3.59698SNP_A-1780289	1.59221SNP_A-1780292	1.535SNP_A-1780294	1.93107SNP_A-1780295	0.739705SNP_A-1780300	2.19462SNP_A-1780302	2.99121SNP_A-1780303	2.46319SNP_A-1780304	3.89867SNP_A-1780305	2.33351SNP_A-1780311	2.19864SNP_A-1780312	1.50277SNP_A-1780313	2.14211SNP_A-1780316	1.74008SNP_A-1780318	1.99665SNP_A-1780320	3.72675!sample_table_end
