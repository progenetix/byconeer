Copy number estimates were calculated in Partek against a reference baseline consisting of 90 female CEPH samples. Copy number segmentation was performed by Parteks Genomic segmentation tool with a minumum number of markers of 20. Threshold for calling gains and losses set to -0.25 < 2 > +25. Signal to noise 0.45.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Marcel,,Smid!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Erasmus MC!Sample_contact_address = Dr. Molewaterplein 50!Sample_contact_city = Rotterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 2040, 3000CA!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1309nnn/GSM1309774/suppl/GSM1309774_EA06018_0253-07F_Sty250_4163_PCRS.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE54193!Sample_series_id = GSE54219!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #VALUE = Copy number estimates per SNP!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780271	1.0227SNP_A-1780274	1.74684SNP_A-1780277	0.912579SNP_A-1780278	2.07215SNP_A-1780283	1.27671SNP_A-1780290	1.85591SNP_A-1780293	3.7212SNP_A-1780299	2.59272SNP_A-1780301	1.35146SNP_A-1780310	1.21986SNP_A-1780315	1.48616SNP_A-1780317	3.97463SNP_A-1780319	2.23907SNP_A-1780324	1.86967SNP_A-1780325	3.74885SNP_A-1780328	1.27124SNP_A-1780333	1.98621SNP_A-1780335	1.36313SNP_A-1780339	2.78666SNP_A-1780340	1.01631!sample_table_end
