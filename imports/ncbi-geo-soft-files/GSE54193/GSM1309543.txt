Copy number estimates were calculated in Partek against a reference baseline consisting of 90 female CEPH samples. Copy number segmentation was performed by Parteks Genomic segmentation tool with a minumum number of markers of 20. Threshold for calling gains and losses set to -0.25 < 2 > +25. Signal to noise 0.45.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Marcel,,Smid!Sample_contact_department = Medical Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = Erasmus MC!Sample_contact_address = Dr. Molewaterplein 50!Sample_contact_city = Rotterdam!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = PO Box 2040, 3000CA!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1309nnn/GSM1309543/suppl/GSM1309543_EA06018_0214-04A_Nsp250_VER804_PCRN.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE54193!Sample_series_id = GSE54219!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Copy number estimates per SNP!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780270	3.34977SNP_A-1780272	1.77877SNP_A-1780285	1.41734SNP_A-1780286	0.922535SNP_A-1780287	2.63969SNP_A-1780289	2.69312SNP_A-1780292	2.82285SNP_A-1780294	2.13885SNP_A-1780295	2.41799SNP_A-1780300	2.63975SNP_A-1780302	3.0333SNP_A-1780303	2.17788SNP_A-1780304	1.07849SNP_A-1780305	1.85334SNP_A-1780311	2.02537SNP_A-1780312	1.41023SNP_A-1780313	1.67264SNP_A-1780316	1.44819SNP_A-1780318	1.89987SNP_A-1780320	2.29895!sample_table_end
