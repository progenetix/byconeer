The cells on the glass slides were air dried for fixation. The fixed cells were collected with a polypropylen swab and washed with phosphate buffered saline. Finally DNA was extracted from these cells.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = gDNA was extracted from tumor touch imprint cells following the high salt method from Miller SA (1988): Proteinase K digestion at 56 Â°C overnight, protein precipitation with 6 M NaCl, DNA precipitation with absolute ethanol, DNA dissolved in TE buffer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Affymetrix Cytoscan HD protocol!Sample_hyb_protocol = Affymetrix Cytoscan HD protocol!Sample_scan_protocol = Affymetrix Cytoscan HD protocol!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix fluorescence intensity raw data (cel files) were processed with the Chromosome Analysis Suite (version 2.1) with default parameters resulting in Affymetrix Cytoscan HD cychp files.!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix Cytoscan HD array fluorescence intensity raw data!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Clemens,,Brunner!Sample_contact_email = clemens.brunner@ccri.at!Sample_contact_department = Tumor Biology!Sample_contact_institute = Children's Cancer Research Institute!Sample_contact_address = Zimmermannplatz 10!Sample_contact_city = Vienna!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 1090!Sample_contact_country = Austria!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2087nnn/GSM2087500/suppl/GSM2087500_ES01.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2087nnn/GSM2087500/suppl/GSM2087500_ES01.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE79187!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693#ID_REF = #VALUE = LOG2 RATIO#WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO = #SMOOTH SIGNAL = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	WEIGHTED LOG2 RATIO	SMOOTH SIGNALC-7SARK	0.233969	-0.197268	1.462207C-4WYLN	-0.396294	-0.229193	1.461946C-3BFNY	-0.573845	-0.378783	1.461782C-7ONNE	-0.479865	-0.410798	1.462467C-6HYCN	-0.094457	-0.329123	1.462266C-7SCGC	-0.354574	-0.361447	1.461612C-7RZQQ	-0.615617	-0.477170	1.461600C-7RZWZ	-0.613323	-0.510233	1.460711C-7SEBI	-0.181925	0.043299	1.460383C-7RZIL	0.164747	0.008777	1.461159C-4NQTX	-0.084208	-0.050459	1.460857C-7SDKW	0.015531	-0.087472	1.460622S-3WRNV	nan	nan	nanC-7RXVK	-0.517370	-0.325840	1.460641C-4LHKS	-0.667207	-0.366647	1.461042C-7RWHE	-0.299812	-0.361782	1.461304C-7SBEJ	0.022235	-0.407888	1.461842C-7RYJO	-0.724432	-0.359671	1.462437C-7SEGS	-0.193819	-0.412673	1.463163C-4LLXK	-0.295188	-0.345365	1.464061!sample_table_end
