For high molecular weight genomic DNA,  frozen tissue sections were homogenized in 1 ml of G2-buffer supplemented with 2 ml RNase (Qiagen). Subsequently, DNA was extracted  using the genomic buffer kit with 20/G genomic-tips (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's recommendations.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = PCR products were labeled with a single biotin according to the Affymetrix protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Following fragmentation, biotinylated PCR fragments were hybridized overnight according to the Affymetrix protocol.!Sample_scan_protocol = GCS3000 (Affymetrix)!Sample_data_processing = The raw cel files were converted into probeset-specific expression values using Affymetrix MAS5 summarization method as implemented in the BioConductor package simpleaffy (Gentleman et al., 2004). All samples were scaled to have a mean expression level of 100. Copy number values were inferred from raw CEL files with a GenePattern pipeline which runs the following modules: SNPFileCreator, CopyNumberInference, RemoveCopyNumberOutliers, DivideByNormals and Quality Control.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = BjÃ¶rn,,Chapuy!Sample_contact_email = Bjoern_Chapuy@dfci.harvard.edu!Sample_contact_phone = +1-617-632-3881!Sample_contact_laboratory = Shipp Lab!Sample_contact_department = Medical Onology!Sample_contact_institute = Dana-Farber Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 450 Brookline Ave.!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02215!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM845nnn/GSM845608/suppl/GSM845608.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE34171!Sample_data_row_count = 1851810#ID_REF = #VALUE = See data processing.!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUECN_473963	6.388CN_473964	2.963CN_473965	3.385CN_477984	1.789CN_473981	7.843CN_473982	3.322CN_497980	3.491CN_497981	1.935CN_513369	7.525CN_513370	4.203CN_517762	5.732CN_517763	2.506CN_502615	7.182CN_502613	3.911CN_502614	9.616CN_502616	16.721CN_502842	3.661CN_502843	3.512CN_466171	2.002CN_466172	1.755!sample_table_end
