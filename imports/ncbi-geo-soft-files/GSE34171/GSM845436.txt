For high molecular weight genomic DNA,  frozen tissue sections were homogenized in 1 ml of G2-buffer supplemented with 2 ml RNase (Qiagen). Subsequently, DNA was extracted  using the genomic buffer kit with 20/G genomic-tips (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's recommendations.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = PCR products were labeled with a single biotin according to the Affymetrix protocol.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Following fragmentation, biotinylated PCR fragments were hybridized overnight according to the Affymetrix protocol.!Sample_scan_protocol = GCS3000 (Affymetrix)!Sample_description = HAMES_p_Shipp_AffySNP_22010_GenomeWideSNP_6_E12_566518!Sample_data_processing = The raw cel files were converted into probeset-specific expression values using Affymetrix MAS5 summarization method as implemented in the BioConductor package simpleaffy (Gentleman et al., 2004). All samples were scaled to have a mean expression level of 100. Copy number values were inferred from raw CEL files with a GenePattern pipeline which runs the following modules: SNPFileCreator, CopyNumberInference, RemoveCopyNumberOutliers, DivideByNormals and Quality Control.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = BjÃ¶rn,,Chapuy!Sample_contact_email = Bjoern_Chapuy@dfci.harvard.edu!Sample_contact_phone = +1-617-632-3881!Sample_contact_laboratory = Shipp Lab!Sample_contact_department = Medical Onology!Sample_contact_institute = Dana-Farber Cancer Institute!Sample_contact_address = 450 Brookline Ave.!Sample_contact_city = Boston!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02215!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM845nnn/GSM845436/suppl/GSM845436.CEL.gz!Sample_relation = Reanalyzed by: GSM1509134!Sample_series_id = GSE34171!Sample_data_row_count = 1851810#ID_REF = #VALUE = See data processing.!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUECN_473963	2.193CN_473964	2.381CN_473965	1.883CN_477984	1.826CN_473981	5.481CN_473982	2.563CN_497980	1.368CN_497981	1.953CN_513369	2.240CN_513370	0.914CN_517762	2.606CN_517763	1.868CN_502615	2.813CN_502613	1.724CN_502614	2.220CN_502616	2.683CN_502842	2.212CN_502843	1.578CN_466171	1.688CN_466172	1.979!sample_table_end
