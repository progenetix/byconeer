Images were quantified using Agilent Feature Extraction Software (version A.8.5.1.1).!Sample_description = patient's CD34+ cells DNA hybridized against its own T cells DNA!Sample_data_processing = Agilent Feature Extraction Software (v 8.5.1.1) was used for background subtraction and LOWESS normalization. All arrays were then treated by the WACA algorithm [Lepretre et al., NAR 2010]. This algorithm was used to remove all false aberrations, without modifying real aberrations, allowing efficient further analysis. CGH analytics software V3.4, the Human Genome built 17 and the database of Genomic Variants built 36 (March 2006) were at last used for copy number detection and analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9075!Sample_contact_name = frÃ©dÃ©ric,,leprÃªtre!Sample_contact_email = frederic.lepretre@univ-lille.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = plateforme de gÃ©nomique fonctionnelle et structurale!Sample_contact_department = CHU of Lille, CBP!Sample_contact_institute = Lille University!Sample_contact_address = Boulevard du Pr Leclercq!Sample_contact_city = lille!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 59037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM546nnn/GSM546825/suppl/GSM546825.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21986!Sample_data_row_count = 99026#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2Ratio LOWESS and WACA normalized/processed (CD34+ cells/T cells)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_14_P100000	0.00854477697432478A_14_P100001	-0.00973279379892867A_14_P100002	0.00144193033480993A_14_P100003	-0.0195707337349273A_14_P100005	-0.046703569645407A_14_P100006	-0.0340774611324863A_14_P100007	0.0238657895867974A_14_P100008	-0.00239405356269231A_14_P100009	0.00465849009132355A_14_P100010	0.0113642977555421A_14_P100011	-0.0063092969441573A_14_P100012	-0.00429103983392511A_14_P100013	0.00180523564028850A_14_P100014	0.370975721508598A_14_P100015	0.0439609486729389A_14_P100016	0.333749811841547A_14_P100017	0.0120433826439757A_14_P100018	0.00650078823102988A_14_P100019	-0.0104353721019638A_14_P100020	-0.0396654904468971!sample_table_end
