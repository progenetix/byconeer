Images were quantified using Agilent Feature Extraction Software (version A.8.5.1.1).!Sample_description = patient's CD34+ cells DNA hybridized against its own T cells DNA!Sample_data_processing = Agilent Feature Extraction Software (v 8.5.1.1) was used for background subtraction and LOWESS normalization. All arrays were then treated by the WACA algorithm [Lepretre et al., NAR 2010]. This algorithm was used to remove all false aberrations, without modifying real aberrations, allowing efficient further analysis. CGH analytics software V3.4, the Human Genome built 17 and the database of Genomic Variants built 36 (March 2006) were at last used for copy number detection and analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9075!Sample_contact_name = frÃ©dÃ©ric,,leprÃªtre!Sample_contact_email = frederic.lepretre@univ-lille.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = plateforme de gÃ©nomique fonctionnelle et structurale!Sample_contact_department = CHU of Lille, CBP!Sample_contact_institute = Lille University!Sample_contact_address = Boulevard du Pr Leclercq!Sample_contact_city = lille!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 59037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM546nnn/GSM546815/suppl/GSM546815.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21986!Sample_data_row_count = 99026#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2Ratio LOWESS and WACA normalized/processed (CD34+ cells/T cells)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_14_P100000	-0.0309435244893778A_14_P100001	-0.0507454621178524A_14_P100002	0.0118781757770941A_14_P100003	-0.0484566985824902A_14_P100005	-0.0146107395396009A_14_P100006	-0.0512624653925532A_14_P100007	0.0422888910535242A_14_P100008	-0.0382365647993867A_14_P100009	-0.0467930014891609A_14_P100010	0.0162648527887325A_14_P100011	-0.0250144063188683A_14_P100012	-0.0436962453774513A_14_P100013	-0.059461026668982A_14_P100014	-0.159246090404305A_14_P100015	-0.0193188198150726A_14_P100016	0.327087001290201A_14_P100017	0.0562147599076203A_14_P100018	-0.0544599464077097A_14_P100019	-0.00599470919582397A_14_P100020	-0.0425477735976344!sample_table_end
