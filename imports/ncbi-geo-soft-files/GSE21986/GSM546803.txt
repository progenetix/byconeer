Images were quantified using Agilent Feature Extraction Software (version A.8.5.1.1).!Sample_description = patient's CD34+ cells DNA hybridized against its own T cells DNA!Sample_data_processing = Agilent Feature Extraction Software (v 8.5.1.1) was used for background subtraction and LOWESS normalization. All arrays were then treated by the WACA algorithm [Lepretre et al., NAR 2010]. This algorithm was used to remove all false aberrations, without modifying real aberrations, allowing efficient further analysis. CGH analytics software V3.4, the Human Genome built 17 and the database of Genomic Variants built 36 (March 2006) were at last used for copy number detection and analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9075!Sample_contact_name = frÃ©dÃ©ric,,leprÃªtre!Sample_contact_email = frederic.lepretre@univ-lille.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = plateforme de gÃ©nomique fonctionnelle et structurale!Sample_contact_department = CHU of Lille, CBP!Sample_contact_institute = Lille University!Sample_contact_address = Boulevard du Pr Leclercq!Sample_contact_city = lille!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 59037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM546nnn/GSM546803/suppl/GSM546803.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21986!Sample_data_row_count = 99026#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2Ratio LOWESS and WACA normalized/processed (CD34+ cells/T cells)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_14_P100000	0.0117366677277037A_14_P100001	-0.0259992081807754A_14_P100002	-0.0080920756784447A_14_P100003	-0.0890403687917307A_14_P100005	-0.0215321407753388A_14_P100006	-0.00686104973247936A_14_P100007	0.077442284005579A_14_P100008	-0.0193121598319446A_14_P100009	0.00108413033671348A_14_P100010	-0.000336207135038804A_14_P100011	-0.0345566237797773A_14_P100012	0.000918111311798454A_14_P100013	-0.0431325480719873A_14_P100014	-0.048727220628201A_14_P100015	0.0407159263433785A_14_P100016	0.199136759315031A_14_P100017	0.0325842861615166A_14_P100018	-0.0339410452193062A_14_P100019	0.0364880310383755A_14_P100020	0.0836073061832023!sample_table_end
