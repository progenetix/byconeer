Images were quantified using Agilent Feature Extraction Software (version A.8.5.1.1).!Sample_description = patient's CD34+ cells DNA hybridized against its own T cells DNA!Sample_data_processing = Agilent Feature Extraction Software (v 8.5.1.1) was used for background subtraction and LOWESS normalization. All arrays were then treated by the WACA algorithm [Lepretre et al., NAR 2010]. This algorithm was used to remove all false aberrations, without modifying real aberrations, allowing efficient further analysis. CGH analytics software V3.4, the Human Genome built 17 and the database of Genomic Variants built 36 (March 2006) were at last used for copy number detection and analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL9075!Sample_contact_name = frÃ©dÃ©ric,,leprÃªtre!Sample_contact_email = frederic.lepretre@univ-lille.fr!Sample_contact_laboratory = plateforme de gÃ©nomique fonctionnelle et structurale!Sample_contact_department = CHU of Lille, CBP!Sample_contact_institute = Lille University!Sample_contact_address = Boulevard du Pr Leclercq!Sample_contact_city = lille!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 59037!Sample_contact_country = France!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM546nnn/GSM546804/suppl/GSM546804.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21986!Sample_data_row_count = 99026#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2Ratio LOWESS and WACA normalized/processed (CD34+ cells/T cells)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_14_P100000	-0.00629854293810213A_14_P100001	-0.0135860488394913A_14_P100002	-0.0608088501718574A_14_P100003	-0.0465172069006964A_14_P100005	-0.00590330478561446A_14_P100006	-0.187212015148477A_14_P100007	0.0504720064090808A_14_P100008	0.0133894907130680A_14_P100009	-0.00199124617510808A_14_P100010	0.00539297196550646A_14_P100011	-0.000902063072028254A_14_P100012	-0.0148280417105591A_14_P100013	0.0039435223078675A_14_P100014	-0.131047962825821A_14_P100015	0.0373575775331361A_14_P100016	0.0407101739175306A_14_P100017	-0.142170776806913A_14_P100018	0.0198488568332834A_14_P100019	-0.0173187796197107A_14_P100020	-0.0216272503405238!sample_table_end
