The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM289nnn/GSM289416/suppl/GSM289416_128.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE11872!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3 Test#CH2_SIG = Cy5 Ref#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	-3.888788	19.4520000	401.3140000	0.0500002	-3.190913	102.8020000	1784.3070000	0.1800003	-0.016523	26542.3030000	33955.7380000	0.7500004	-0.089967	21988.9450000	30065.3690000	0.7700005	-0.140459	18140.4180000	26057.1020000	0.8800006	0.588170	45380.9100000	36622.7030000	0.7700007	0.083410	27443.0470000	32761.2340000	0.6900008	0.250107	312.6640000	489.9190000	0.0700009	0.103415	6742.7640000	9669.6370000	0.82000010	0.020287	60010.1020000	64389.2930000	0.26000011	0.045538	40266.9450000	46593.6020000	0.66000012	-0.018756	34372.2380000	42781.6600000	0.73000013	-0.120027	21694.4220000	30261.0410000	0.76000014	-0.086333	9254.9290000	13901.0850000	0.87000015	0.004627	6934.0760000	10526.9020000	0.74000016	0.107281	13260.2900000	16712.3380000	0.79000017	0.159330	21605.9980000	24976.3670000	0.65000018	0.209337	19914.3480000	22365.2050000	0.80000019	-0.100265	21342.4940000	29400.5760000	0.73000020	-0.117754	31611.2810000	42389.7030000	0.740000!sample_table_end
