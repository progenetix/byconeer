The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM289nnn/GSM289387/suppl/GSM289387_120.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE11872!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3 Test#CH2_SIG = Cy5 Ref#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	2.127320	812.2260000	244.5670000	0.0100002	1.157840	490.4890000	268.6940000	0.0100003	0.198794	24276.1170000	25468.7950000	0.8100004	0.118569	27767.3130000	30086.6660000	0.8400005	0.088821	23263.6390000	26294.9960000	0.8100006	0.048308	26252.1290000	30148.1540000	0.8700007	0.108718	28090.7010000	30666.8850000	0.8500008	-3.999639	27.4990000	308.5580000	0.0100009	0.356459	7730.6410000	9392.4270000	0.83000010	-0.122389	59730.6760000	68001.8130000	0.22000011	0.253856	39645.2620000	38093.1760000	0.74000012	0.213882	39523.7770000	39035.5740000	0.80000013	0.158202	20239.2070000	22427.5270000	0.78000014	0.181150	10144.8810000	12628.7420000	0.87000015	0.400384	3925.9070000	6231.3050000	0.69000016	0.186348	15665.0230000	17763.5250000	0.81000017	0.078935	22383.4590000	25771.2070000	0.86000018	0.068117	19283.0390000	22828.6840000	0.84000019	0.128386	20812.0840000	23317.4200000	0.79000020	0.059143	28552.9530000	32196.2190000	0.790000!sample_table_end
