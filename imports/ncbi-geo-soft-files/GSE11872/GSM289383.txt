The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM289nnn/GSM289383/suppl/GSM289383_109.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE11872!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3 Test#CH2_SIG = Cy5 Ref#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	3.781465	255.7910000	46.7300000	0.0100002	-1.643828	190.0440000	1901.4190000	0.1900003	1.138720	45607.2110000	26664.3300000	0.8400004	0.009448	17736.0860000	23256.7700000	0.9200005	-0.019503	14188.2720000	19478.8520000	0.7800006	-0.192390	14894.8770000	22782.4120000	0.9200007	-0.042924	19270.0980000	25920.4100000	0.9100008	-0.749496	130.5740000	632.8260000	0.0600009	-0.030855	8263.4360000	12935.8860000	0.88000010	-0.096227	44001.6760000	56539.4180000	0.64000011	-0.006795	50678.1130000	59662.2420000	0.31000012	-0.252918	16486.6660000	25821.5570000	0.87000013	-0.548484	9767.5540000	20117.4100000	0.89000014	0.105906	5121.9860000	8785.6550000	0.57000015	0.090052	6033.6370000	9778.9400000	0.83000016	0.037485	10174.1040000	14507.3070000	0.90000017	-0.124289	11168.4660000	17177.2250000	0.92000018	-0.094835	10070.7190000	15548.6000000	0.89000019	-0.111362	10195.2640000	15847.2740000	0.91000020	-0.212790	14858.9410000	22926.3160000	0.870000!sample_table_end
