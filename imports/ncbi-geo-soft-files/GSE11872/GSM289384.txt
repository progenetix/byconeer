The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM289nnn/GSM289384/suppl/GSM289384_91.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE11872!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3 Test#CH2_SIG = Cy5 Ref#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	-0.273842	224.2490000	935.8900000	0.0300002	0.136167	487.3770000	1635.4600000	0.1000003	1.883542	44847.1450000	14250.2380000	0.8800004	-0.585474	5196.4720000	11241.5430000	0.8600005	-0.157953	10072.9000000	14243.6000000	0.8500006	-0.563866	6950.0740000	13748.9960000	0.9000007	-0.383000	9161.9220000	15183.9790000	0.9100008	-1.768962	39.5630000	411.8600000	0.0400009	0.395495	6603.0950000	7442.0190000	0.85000010	-0.326870	23915.7070000	34618.1210000	0.86000011	0.141780	36127.6800000	36729.3590000	0.84000012	-0.296197	10302.6630000	15831.4870000	0.89000013	-0.400162	6899.9920000	12344.1360000	0.91000014	-0.283825	2225.5990000	5502.7800000	0.58000015	0.424432	3574.9630000	4876.0050000	0.79000016	-0.188230	4623.8100000	8194.6770000	0.87000017	-0.239715	6375.3530000	10623.3760000	0.88000018	-0.387013	4610.8880000	9175.6880000	0.89000019	-0.375483	4616.3630000	9109.1130000	0.84000020	-0.245574	8254.3490000	12917.1480000	0.900000!sample_table_end
