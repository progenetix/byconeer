The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM289nnn/GSM289386/suppl/GSM289386_111.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE11872!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3 Test#CH2_SIG = Cy5 Ref#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	3.535273	431.0380000	93.9260000	0.0100002	-1.505240	328.6190000	2350.1300000	0.1600003	-1.124428	20872.6270000	47670.1600000	0.8400004	0.239600	11579.6250000	11009.7500000	0.8200005	0.165267	7672.1020000	8573.6530000	0.8100006	0.151790	11548.2590000	11575.3990000	0.9000007	0.013547	16915.5270000	17710.6600000	0.8100008	-0.488414	182.2610000	652.4830000	0.0700009	-0.270109	7776.1700000	11095.4300000	0.75000010	0.168385	29411.5980000	27346.7890000	0.73000011	-0.092277	48554.3980000	55135.1130000	0.28000012	0.090802	16261.7650000	16237.6410000	0.81000013	-0.131724	10218.9230000	12576.4150000	0.88000014	0.375216	4410.2880000	5543.0790000	0.62000015	-0.446593	3853.5320000	7972.7750000	0.72000016	0.097758	6905.2460000	8322.5630000	0.82000017	0.035211	12908.2890000	13683.2450000	0.93000018	0.126148	11686.9460000	11881.5590000	0.86000019	0.150591	11564.3690000	11643.6680000	0.89000020	0.053973	18966.3260000	19206.2660000	0.890000!sample_table_end
