The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM289nnn/GSM289417/suppl/GSM289417_126.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE11872!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3 Test#CH2_SIG = Cy5 Ref#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	4.309778	998.3850000	149.2510000	0.0400002	-0.342722	270.6810000	1103.9950000	0.1600003	-0.155800	9722.6330000	15251.7100000	0.9300004	-0.066145	9533.4440000	14220.3230000	0.9400005	-0.277071	5115.7650000	10235.8340000	0.7900006	0.797360	18842.2890000	14527.8200000	0.9600007	-0.096025	9642.7900000	14592.8090000	0.9400008	1.729710	303.1480000	255.8650000	0.0400009	0.049859	1662.6310000	4847.9570000	0.43000010	-0.226210	23321.0780000	34340.0430000	0.92000011	-0.242595	15195.0930000	23530.3440000	0.85000012	-0.223274	12080.7200000	19132.2270000	0.90000013	-0.474297	5124.1220000	11537.5070000	0.85000014	-0.461475	1329.1840000	5659.5080000	0.38000015	-1.419490	267.9680000	2722.9260000	0.20000016	-0.181179	2881.7750000	6970.7150000	0.71000017	-0.149960	6657.8610000	11429.3840000	0.90000018	0.049354	5110.6340000	8485.5930000	0.86000019	-0.210989	6202.2320000	11297.8960000	0.75000020	-0.255619	9542.3610000	16010.6180000	0.920000!sample_table_end
