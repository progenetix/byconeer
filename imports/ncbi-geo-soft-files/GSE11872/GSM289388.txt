The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM289nnn/GSM289388/suppl/GSM289388_129.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE11872!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3 Test#CH2_SIG = Cy5 Ref#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	1.410585	549.1330000	259.0470000	0.0300002	3.894660	1097.7140000	626.1370000	0.1000003	0.302081	6616.7310000	8453.0590000	0.7800004	0.187815	10515.0510000	12835.6330000	0.8400005	0.431462	6106.2730000	7531.0020000	0.8200006	0.532586	7590.1590000	8241.3040000	0.8300007	0.445215	9337.5240000	9865.0750000	0.7800008	-0.801645	91.0770000	161.1180000	0.0100009	0.243283	850.4140000	3898.4040000	0.24000010	-0.108680	18584.6880000	24336.6760000	0.66000011	-0.028287	20944.2580000	25532.4300000	0.66000012	-0.004092	8284.5090000	12173.7630000	0.76000013	-0.079911	1227.1150000	4846.6670000	0.24000014	-2.125192	126.2770000	2861.6010000	0.19000015	0.173357	1417.4680000	4550.2130000	0.36000016	-0.068928	1474.4390000	5109.4270000	0.41000017	-0.396795	2866.6990000	7652.9810000	0.61000018	0.707451	3344.4060000	4727.1590000	0.62000019	-0.272539	1884.5090000	5935.7610000	0.49000020	0.183703	3377.7990000	6124.5990000	0.660000!sample_table_end
