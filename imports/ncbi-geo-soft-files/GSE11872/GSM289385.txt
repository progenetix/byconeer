The samples were denatured at 70oC for 15mins and pre-hybridized at 37oC for 60mins. Meanwhile, array slides were denatured at 95oC for 2mins, allowed to cool and pre-hybridized in blocking buffer (25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 5X SSC, 1g BSA) at 42oC for 60mins. The array slides were gently washed in 0.1X SSC for 30secs and spun dry at 2000rpm for 3mins. The pre-hybridized test and reference DNA samples were applied onto cover slips and hybridized onto the array slides. The slides were then transferred into a small hybridization chamber containing Whatmann 3MM paper saturated with dH20 and incubated in a rocking hybridization oven at 42oC for 24hrs. Post hybridization, slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 50% formamide at 45oC for 15mins, then 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45oC for 30mins and finally followed by 0.2X SSC for 15mins at room temperature. Slides were spun dry in a centrifuge for 3mins at 2000rpm and stored in a dark dry container until scanning.!Sample_scan_protocol = Hybridized microarrays were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner at 5micron scans for both channels.!Sample_description = None!Sample_data_processing = Images were put through a data extraction program called BlueFuse (Blue Gnome, Cambridge UK) along with a clone position file. Primary data analysis and normalisation were carried out using web-based analysis tool called LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) developed in our laboratory. The microarray data were normalised using lowess and MANOR algorithms and data points smoothed using a 1Mb window.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6853!Sample_contact_name = Ken,,Choi!Sample_contact_email = rmjobkc@ucl.ac.uk!Sample_contact_laboratory = TRL!Sample_contact_department = Gynaecological Oncology!Sample_contact_institute = University College London!Sample_contact_address = 46 Cleveland Street!Sample_contact_city = London!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = W1T 4JF!Sample_contact_country = United Kingdom!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM289nnn/GSM289385/suppl/GSM289385_89.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE11872!Sample_data_row_count = 31611#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2 ratio test over ref, spatial and lowess normalisation#CH1_SIG = Cy3 Test#CH2_SIG = Cy5 Ref#CONFIDENCE = Confidence estimate in the ratio of the two channels (BlueFuse software)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG	CH2_SIG	CONFIDENCE1	0.275610	1308.9630000	1946.8260000	0.1200002	-0.279948	1497.0180000	2868.0900000	0.2100003	-1.662179	7935.2310000	20989.0680000	0.9200004	-0.366850	4348.2150000	5531.0470000	0.8200005	-0.463002	6102.1970000	7539.3320000	0.8500006	-0.477798	4306.3130000	5842.0150000	0.8200007	-0.099344	56127.1210000	56284.2070000	0.3300008	-0.223422	43143.8440000	45610.8160000	0.7200009	-0.150424	42611.2770000	42696.9180000	0.75000010	-0.195188	34839.3870000	35213.7030000	0.60000011	-0.506328	14132.9660000	16691.3460000	0.95000012	-0.368902	2995.2710000	4348.8470000	0.75000013	-0.527039	1655.8310000	3434.2250000	0.55000014	-0.411970	12158.5620000	13551.6120000	0.66000015	-0.206794	42562.3870000	44520.0740000	0.89000016	-0.557766	3112.9150000	4933.1250000	0.70000017	-0.407068	5929.1970000	7097.8670000	0.87000018	-0.527321	4336.7850000	6045.2130000	0.81000019	-0.116790	1799.3840000	2896.2720000	0.50000020	-0.422145	3697.5830000	5101.4400000	0.790000!sample_table_end
