After adaptors ligation, DNA was amplified in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 using the TITANIUM DNA Amplification Kit. Following amplification, DNA was fragmented with DNAse I and subsequently biotin end-labeled.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Labeled samples were applied to microarrays and hybridized during 18 h at 49 0C in the hybridization oven!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to 250K_Sty!Sample_data_processing = Copy number normalization, to produce log2ratios for individual SNPs was performed using ACNE and NSA R packages. Tumor purity was estimated for each patient using GPHMM software. Circular Binary Segmentation was applied using DNAcopy R package on log2ratio data. Segmented log2ratio was adjusted by estimated tumor purity.!Sample_data_processing = Log2ratio segments may fall within the same gene for a given sample. To solve this problem, a single value was assigned to each gene. A weighted median was performed to the log2ratio values of the segments within the analyzed gene, where the weights correspond to the length of the corresponding segments within the gene.!Sample_data_processing = The Ensembl 54 reference gene set was used (http://may2009.archive.ensembl.org/)!Sample_data_processing = Segmented log2ratio adjusted by tumor purity and summarized by gene (according to Ensembl 54 gene annotation)!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Angel,,Rubio!Sample_contact_email = arubio@ceit.es!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = CEIT!Sample_contact_address = Paseo Mikeletegi, NÂº 48!Sample_contact_city = San Sebastian!Sample_contact_state = GUIPÃZCOA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20009!Sample_contact_country = Spain!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1857nnn/GSM1857299/suppl/GSM1857299_Eu16_Sty.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72192!Sample_series_id = GSE72195!Sample_data_row_count = 232889#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2ratio values for individual SNPs prior to segmentation and tumor purity correction!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1909444	-0.560390253SNP_A-2237149	-1.104012928SNP_A-4303947	-0.465548566SNP_A-2236359	-0.683825381SNP_A-2205441	-0.317470834SNP_A-2116190	-0.614687884SNP_A-4291020	-0.837778645SNP_A-2109914	-0.206559019SNP_A-2291997	-0.346644726SNP_A-4277872	-1.010026436SNP_A-2118217	-0.544329631SNP_A-1866065	-0.154304566SNP_A-2288244	-0.660403857SNP_A-1783407	-0.781326357SNP_A-2169457	-0.609982753SNP_A-4271011	-0.811167156SNP_A-2082515	-0.686582029SNP_A-1910751	-0.749165977SNP_A-2081399	0.442796983SNP_A-2223642	-0.482118959!sample_table_end
