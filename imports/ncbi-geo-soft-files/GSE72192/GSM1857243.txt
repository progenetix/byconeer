After adaptors ligation, DNA was amplified in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 using the TITANIUM DNA Amplification Kit. Following amplification, DNA was fragmented with DNAse I and subsequently biotin end-labeled.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Labeled samples were applied to microarrays and hybridized during 18 h at 49 0C in the hybridization oven!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to 250K_Nsp!Sample_data_processing = Copy number normalization, to produce log2ratios for individual SNPs was performed using ACNE and NSA R packages. Tumor purity was estimated for each patient using GPHMM software. Circular Binary Segmentation was applied using DNAcopy R package on log2ratio data. Segmented log2ratio was adjusted by estimated tumor purity.!Sample_data_processing = Log2ratio segments may fall within the same gene for a given sample. To solve this problem, a single value was assigned to each gene. A weighted median was performed to the log2ratio values of the segments within the analyzed gene, where the weights correspond to the length of the corresponding segments within the gene.!Sample_data_processing = The Ensembl 54 reference gene set was used (http://may2009.archive.ensembl.org/)!Sample_data_processing = Segmented log2ratio adjusted by tumor purity and summarized by gene (according to Ensembl 54 gene annotation)!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Angel,,Rubio!Sample_contact_email = arubio@ceit.es!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = CEIT!Sample_contact_address = Paseo Mikeletegi, NÂº 48!Sample_contact_city = San Sebastian!Sample_contact_state = GUIPÃZCOA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20009!Sample_contact_country = Spain!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1857nnn/GSM1857243/suppl/GSM1857243_Eu001_Nsp.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE72192!Sample_series_id = GSE72195!Sample_data_row_count = 255867#ID_REF = #VALUE = Log2ratio values for individual SNPs prior to segmentation and tumor purity correction!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1886933	0.940545972SNP_A-1902458	0.662762349SNP_A-2131660	0.645841457SNP_A-4221087	0.106009505SNP_A-1884606	0.123210806SNP_A-2235839	0.472926047SNP_A-2218153	-0.091795688SNP_A-1919019	0.212932402SNP_A-1815933	0.528186999SNP_A-2115098	0.832185111SNP_A-2264565	0.484094428SNP_A-1788728	0.353948389SNP_A-4218776	0.450901628SNP_A-2082194	0.072181845SNP_A-2135694	0.679437682SNP_A-4220764	-0.017952893SNP_A-1796345	0.923294385SNP_A-1789472	0.366824841SNP_A-1934233	0.925320181SNP_A-4207031	0.571477807!sample_table_end
