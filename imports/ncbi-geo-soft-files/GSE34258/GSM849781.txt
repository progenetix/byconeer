Probe signals were cablirated for crosstalk between allele probe pairs, normalized for nucleotide-position probe sequence effects, and summarized using the RmaCnPlm method (for the Mapping250K_Nsp platform) or the AvgCnPlm method for (the GenomeWideSNP_6 platform). Probe signals were then normalized for PCR fragment-length effects. Subsequently, raw copy-numbers were calcuated based on either the a pool of reference samples or pair-matched normals.!Sample_data_processing = DNA copy-number values exported from aroma.affymetrix.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = David,J.
