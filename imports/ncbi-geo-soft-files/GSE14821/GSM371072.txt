To identify regions of similar genomic status within the array-CGH data, we applied the segmentation software GLAD. Imbalances with log2 ratios of less than -1.0 were scored as putative homozygous deletions, because this threshold corresponds to an average copy number of less than 1, suggesting the presence of at least one subpopulation of cells with homozygous deletions. Gains with log2 ratios higher than 1.0 were scored as amplifications.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8175!Sample_contact_name = Aurelie,,Ernst!Sample_contact_institute = DKFZ!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM371nnn/GSM371072/suppl/GSM371072_084353.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14821!Sample_series_id = GSE14824!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (glioblastoma/reference DNA)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEG007563	-0.023001338G007109	-0.101178771G007107	0.49152726G007641	-0.046950877G000001	0.478580975G003128	0.348315812G007091	0.367801934G003295	0.531512848G007108	0.071149421G007087	-0.057136224G007105	0.501788919G004205	0.237131623G008027	0.295864788G006935	-0.086607446G003545	0.023079578G004383	0.102013294G007635	0.020339178G007004	-0.037339805G004055	0.03668401G004626	0.034610856!sample_table_end
