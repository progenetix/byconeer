To identify regions of similar genomic status within the array-CGH data, we applied the segmentation software GLAD. Imbalances with log2 ratios of less than -1.0 were scored as putative homozygous deletions, because this threshold corresponds to an average copy number of less than 1, suggesting the presence of at least one subpopulation of cells with homozygous deletions. Gains with log2 ratios higher than 1.0 were scored as amplifications.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8175!Sample_contact_name = Aurelie,,Ernst!Sample_contact_institute = DKFZ!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM371nnn/GSM371073/suppl/GSM371073_084355.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14821!Sample_series_id = GSE14824!Sample_data_row_count = 8049#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (glioblastoma/reference DNA)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEG007563	0.175559237G007109	-0.192261956G007107	0.076333949G007641	0.096313651G000001	0.404850868G003128	0.378525301G007091	0.453498761G003295	0.423038091G007108	0.165500072G007087	-0.1576995G007105	0.30102531G004205	0.324333374G008027	0.244500955G006935	-0.105355897G003545	0.065445683G004383	-0.153432394G007635	0.062364324G007004	0.006260263G004055	-0.312988379G004626	0.173144695!sample_table_end
