Genomic DNA was extracted from secondary RSC  of the index case using QIAamp DNA mini Kit (Qiagen). DNA quantity and quality was measured by reading the whole absorption spectrum (220â750 nm) with NanoDrop and calculating DNA concentration and absorbance ratio at both 260/280 and 230/260 nm. Each sample was then quantified with the Qubit fluorometer using the Quant-iT dsDNA  HS Assay ccording to the manufacturerâs instructions. The quality of each DNA sample was assessed through the gel-electrophotometry.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = The CytoScan HD assay was performed starting with 250 ng DNA. Briefly, total genomic DNA was digested with a restriction enzyme (NspI), ligated to an appropriate adapter for the enzyme, and subjected to PCR amplification using a single primer. After digestion with DNase I, the PCR products were labeled with a biotinylated nucleotide analogue, using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and hybridized to the microarray, according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Hybridization of the Cytoscan HD microarray was carried out in the Hybridization Oven 645 while subsequent washing and staining were performed using the Fluidics Station 450.!Sample_scan_protocol = The array was scanned with the Scanner 3000 7G!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) Software | Affymetrix. Both quality control step and copy number analysis were performed using the Chromosome Analysis Suite Software (ChAS version 2.0; Affymetrix): (1) the raw data file (.CEL) was normalized using the default options; (2) an unpaired analysis was performed using as baseline 270 HapMap samples in order to obtain Copy numbers value from .CEL files while the amplified and/or deleted regions were detected using a standard Hidden Markov Model (HMM) method. To prevent the detection of false positive CNVs arising due to inherent microarray ânoiseâ, only alterations that involved at least 25 consecutive probes and that were more than 25 kb in length were considered in the analysis of gains and losses in our study.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Loris,,De Cecco!Sample_contact_email = loris.dececco@istitutotumori.mi.it!Sample_contact_institute = IRCSS Istituto Nazionale Tumori!Sample_contact_address = via Venezian 1!Sample_contact_city = Milan!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 20133!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1704nnn/GSM1704734/suppl/GSM1704734_CGH_1942_BT_56_CytoScanHD_Array_.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1704nnn/GSM1704734/suppl/GSM1704734_CGH_1942_BT_56_CytoScanHD_Array_.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE69613!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693
