DNA from the tumor samples was isolated using the Genomic-tips 20/G kit (Qiagen). A salting-out procedure was used to isolate genomic DNA from the peripheral blood samples. DNA was quantified using a Nanodrop (NanoDrop technologies) and evaluated for degradation on agarose gel.!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 400 ng of genomic DNA was labelled according to Illumina's standard protocol!Sample_hyb_protocol = Hybridizations were performed at the Leiden Genome Technology Center according to the manufacturer's instructions!Sample_scan_protocol = The beadChips were scanned using the Illumina BeadArray Reader, using the standard Illumina scanning protocol!Sample_data_processing = Image analysis and quality control (call rate > 98%) was performed in Illumina's BeadStudio Version 3.2 software using the genotyping module. Each BeadChip was self-normalized using information contained within the array. Further analysis and visualization was performed with the Illumina Genome Viewer in Beadstudio. First, tumor data was paired with data from their corresponding normal control. Subsequently, examination of the log R ratio (signal intensity tumor/signal intensity normal control) and B allele frequency (BAF) was analyzed for the presence of copy number variations (CNVs) and/or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumor samples. By plotting the log R ratio across a chromosome, CNVs could be visualized by an increase or decrease in baseline signal. Secondly, the BAF was plotted across each chromosome to detect regions of LOH in tumor cells. A region with LOH was defined as a stretch of heterozygous SNPs in normal DNA but homozygous in the matched tumor DNA.!Sample_data_processing = Matrix signal (ie, The signal intensities of all SNPs for each sample) is linked as a supplementary file on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6982!Sample_contact_name = Harry,,Vrieling!Sample_contact_email = h.vrieling@lumc.nl!Sample_contact_laboratory = room T4-34!Sample_contact_department = Toxicogenetics, S4-P!Sample_contact_institute = Leiden University Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = Einthovenweg 20!Sample_contact_city = Leiden!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 2333 ZC!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE32969!Sample_series_id = GSE32979!Sample_data_row_count = 561466#ID_REF = #VALUE = Gtype (Genotype)#BLD1_P.38.Score = #BLD1_P.38.Theta = #BLD1_P.38.R = #BLD1_P.38.B.Allele.Freq = #BLD1_P.38.Log.R.Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BLD1_P.38.Score	BLD1_P.38.Theta	BLD1_P.38.R	BLD1_P.38.B.Allele.Freq	BLD1_P.38.Log.R.RatioMitoA10045G-13273284_B_R_IFB1141652022:0	AA	0.3197343	0.005125484	3.211048	0	-0.5078076MitoA10551G-13273286_T_F_IFB1141639111:0	AA	0.298474	0.02218832	3.578586	0	-0.6459824MitoA11252G-13273288_B_R_IFB1141661584:0	BB	0.329167	0.9745209	2.198177	1	-0.1477151MitoA11468G-13273289_B_R_IFB1141719645:0	AA	0.3187215	0.01711303	4.045553	0.0005587806	-0.63629MitoA11813G-13273292_T_F_IFB1141667833:0	AA	0.2500174	0.0640041	3.149282	0.02318026	-0.7231948MitoA12309G-13273294_T_F_IFB1141664161:0	AA	0.2714231	0.02305235	2.819564	0.001322671	-0.8119905MitoA13106G-13273298_B_R_IFB1141641623:0	AA	0.3484128	0.03422397	1.239168	0.01326617	-0.3392893MitoA13264G-13273299_T_F_IFB1141660858:0	AA	0.2368063	0.03094739	3.725103	0.00310676	-0.8537866MitoA13781G-13273301_T_F_IFB1141687043:0	AA	0.3260496	0.06009943	0.4859832	0.01340879	-1.390548MitoA14234G-13273304_T_F_IFB1141674277:0	AA	0.3183387	0.0197058	1.857896	0.00211134	-0.83296MitoA14583G-13273306_T_F_IFB1141688843:0	AA	0.329661	0.006943079	1.254952	0	-0.8533651MitoA15219G-13273311_T_F_IFB1141717824:0	AA	0.290874	0.07624955	3.594931	0.02285345	-0.5218818MitoA15245G-13273312_B_R_IFB1141677374:0	AA	0.296825	0.04172306	1.52107	0.001220886	-0.8275687MitoA15302G-13273313_T_F_IFB1141686491:0	BB	0.2735513	0.8972711	2.437555	1	-0.2387468MitoA15759G-13273316_B_R_IFB1141715135:0	AA	0.3291785	0.0145829	3.691938	0.003402777	-0.7820988MitoA15925G-13273318_T_F_IFB1141694300:0	AA	0.2904017	0.02979724	2.560256	0	-0.6219169MitoA16163G-13273319_T_F_IFB1141711520:0	AA	0.2521642	0.0835261	3.928988	0.04365061	-0.7061623MitoA16164G-13273320_T_F_IFB1141715312:0	AA	0.3183387	0.01983476	2.721001	0.003389789	-0.7236949MitoA1738G-13273322_T_F_IFB1141639534:0	AA	0.3002029	0.02271961	3.797855	0.003039573	-0.6891164MitoA3349G-13273328_T_F_IFB1141711832:0	AA	0.2904017	0.04607623	4.742818	0.01731922	-0.5706431!sample_table_end
