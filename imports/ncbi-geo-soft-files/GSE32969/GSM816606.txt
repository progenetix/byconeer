DNA from the tumor samples was isolated using the Genomic-tips 20/G kit (Qiagen). A salting-out procedure was used to isolate genomic DNA from the peripheral blood samples. DNA was quantified using a Nanodrop (NanoDrop technologies) and evaluated for degradation on agarose gel.!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 400 ng of genomic DNA was labelled according to Illumina's standard protocol!Sample_hyb_protocol = Hybridizations were performed at the Leiden Genome Technology Center according to the manufacturer's instructions!Sample_scan_protocol = The beadChips were scanned using the Illumina BeadArray Reader, using the standard Illumina scanning protocol!Sample_data_processing = Image analysis and quality control (call rate > 98%) was performed in Illumina's BeadStudio Version 3.2 software using the genotyping module. Each BeadChip was self-normalized using information contained within the array. Further analysis and visualization was performed with the Illumina Genome Viewer in Beadstudio. First, tumor data was paired with data from their corresponding normal control. Subsequently, examination of the log R ratio (signal intensity tumor/signal intensity normal control) and B allele frequency (BAF) was analyzed for the presence of copy number variations (CNVs) and/or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumor samples. By plotting the log R ratio across a chromosome, CNVs could be visualized by an increase or decrease in baseline signal. Secondly, the BAF was plotted across each chromosome to detect regions of LOH in tumor cells. A region with LOH was defined as a stretch of heterozygous SNPs in normal DNA but homozygous in the matched tumor DNA.!Sample_data_processing = Matrix signal (ie, The signal intensities of all SNPs for each sample) is linked as a supplementary file on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6982!Sample_contact_name = Harry,,Vrieling!Sample_contact_email = h.vrieling@lumc.nl!Sample_contact_laboratory = room T4-34!Sample_contact_department = Toxicogenetics, S4-P!Sample_contact_institute = Leiden University Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = Einthovenweg 20!Sample_contact_city = Leiden!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 2333 ZC!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE32969!Sample_series_id = GSE32979!Sample_data_row_count = 561466#ID_REF = #VALUE = Gtype (Genotype)#SCC_P.05.Score = #SCC_P.05.Theta = #SCC_P.05.R = #SCC_P.05.B.Allele.Freq = #SCC_P.05.Log.R.Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SCC_P.05.Score	SCC_P.05.Theta	SCC_P.05.R	SCC_P.05.B.Allele.Freq	SCC_P.05.Log.R.RatioMitoA10045G-13273284_B_R_IFB1141652022:0	AA	0.3121961	0.005420789	2.937313	0	-0.6363548MitoA10551G-13273286_T_F_IFB1141639111:0	AA	0.296771	0.0306219	3.387778	0.007823857	-0.7250326MitoA11252G-13273288_B_R_IFB1141661584:0	BB	0.329167	0.968749	2.122172	1	-0.2206306MitoA11468G-13273289_B_R_IFB1141719645:0	AA	0.3170496	0.01881575	3.686856	0.002192809	-0.7676237MitoA11813G-13273292_T_F_IFB1141667833:0	AA	0.2514375	0.06883186	3.422613	0.0288424	-0.60312MitoA12309G-13273294_T_F_IFB1141664161:0	AA	0.2854636	0.02977537	3.05814	0.008919679	-0.6948082MitoA13106G-13273298_B_R_IFB1141641623:0	AA	0.3484128	0.02471287	1.117049	0.002517377	-0.4889683MitoA13264G-13273299_T_F_IFB1141660858:0	AA	0.2566249	0.03513396	4.338344	0.007887914	-0.6339225MitoA13781G-13273301_T_F_IFB1141687043:0	AA	0.3452063	0.06340779	0.6087509	0.01731788	-1.065603MitoA14234G-13273304_T_F_IFB1141674277:0	AA	0.3183387	0.0214315	1.673386	0.004048334	-0.9838595MitoA14583G-13273306_T_F_IFB1141688843:0	AA	0.329661	0.01293418	1.410675	0.0005349977	-0.6846123MitoA15219G-13273311_T_F_IFB1141717824:0	AA	0.290874	0.07985453	3.302457	0.02717059	-0.6443064MitoA15245G-13273312_B_R_IFB1141677374:0	AA	0.319456	0.05029741	1.997905	0.01119927	-0.4341673MitoA15302G-13273313_T_F_IFB1141686491:0	BB	0.2735513	0.9122844	2.596008	1	-0.07200199MitoA15759G-13273316_B_R_IFB1141715135:0	AA	0.3469073	0.01996264	4.132953	0.009378976	-0.6193043MitoA15925G-13273318_T_F_IFB1141694300:0	AA	0.2904017	0.03354621	2.790495	0.002465606	-0.4976838MitoA16163G-13273319_T_F_IFB1141711520:0	AA	0.2054351	0.104073	3.863333	0.06783187	-0.730474MitoA16164G-13273320_T_F_IFB1141715312:0	BB	0.3183387	0.951417	1.990947	1	-0.2704442MitoA1738G-13273322_T_F_IFB1141639534:0	AA	0.2850213	0.02684907	3.441478	0.007691487	-0.8312729MitoA3349G-13273328_T_F_IFB1141711832:0	AA	0.2904017	0.05229472	4.642266	0.02445127	-0.6015586!sample_table_end
