DNA from the tumor samples was isolated using the Genomic-tips 20/G kit (Qiagen). A salting-out procedure was used to isolate genomic DNA from the peripheral blood samples. DNA was quantified using a Nanodrop (NanoDrop technologies) and evaluated for degradation on agarose gel.!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 400 ng of genomic DNA was labelled according to Illumina's standard protocol!Sample_hyb_protocol = Hybridizations were performed at the Leiden Genome Technology Center according to the manufacturer's instructions!Sample_scan_protocol = The beadChips were scanned using the Illumina BeadArray Reader, using the standard Illumina scanning protocol!Sample_data_processing = Image analysis and quality control (call rate > 98%) was performed in Illumina's BeadStudio Version 3.2 software using the genotyping module. Each BeadChip was self-normalized using information contained within the array. Further analysis and visualization was performed with the Illumina Genome Viewer in Beadstudio. First, tumor data was paired with data from their corresponding normal control. Subsequently, examination of the log R ratio (signal intensity tumor/signal intensity normal control) and B allele frequency (BAF) was analyzed for the presence of copy number variations (CNVs) and/or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumor samples. By plotting the log R ratio across a chromosome, CNVs could be visualized by an increase or decrease in baseline signal. Secondly, the BAF was plotted across each chromosome to detect regions of LOH in tumor cells. A region with LOH was defined as a stretch of heterozygous SNPs in normal DNA but homozygous in the matched tumor DNA.!Sample_data_processing = Matrix signal (ie, The signal intensities of all SNPs for each sample) is linked as a supplementary file on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6982!Sample_contact_name = Harry,,Vrieling!Sample_contact_email = h.vrieling@lumc.nl!Sample_contact_laboratory = room T4-34!Sample_contact_department = Toxicogenetics, S4-P!Sample_contact_institute = Leiden University Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = Einthovenweg 20!Sample_contact_city = Leiden!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 2333 ZC!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE32969!Sample_series_id = GSE32979!Sample_data_row_count = 561466#ID_REF = #VALUE = Gtype (Genotype)#BLD2_P.05.Score = #BLD2_P.05.Theta = #BLD2_P.05.R = #BLD2_P.05.B.Allele.Freq = #BLD2_P.05.Log.R.Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BLD2_P.05.Score	BLD2_P.05.Theta	BLD2_P.05.R	BLD2_P.05.B.Allele.Freq	BLD2_P.05.Log.R.RatioMitoA10045G-13273284_B_R_IFB1141652022:0	AA	0.2955748	0.004055331	2.768467	0	-0.7217644MitoA10551G-13273286_T_F_IFB1141639111:0	AA	0.2956357	0.02346789	3.344042	0	-0.7437788MitoA11252G-13273288_B_R_IFB1141661584:0	BB	0.329167	0.9784576	2.163369	1	-0.1554381MitoA11468G-13273289_B_R_IFB1141719645:0	AA	0.3042952	0.01544743	3.356926	0	-0.9080371MitoA11813G-13273292_T_F_IFB1141667833:0	AA	0.2514043	0.05723013	3.269418	0.01523556	-0.6691841MitoA12309G-13273294_T_F_IFB1141664161:0	AA	0.2447758	0.02130599	2.559467	0	-0.9516189MitoA13106G-13273298_B_R_IFB1141641623:0	AA	0.3484128	0.02462398	1.207518	0.002416917	-0.3766158MitoA13264G-13273299_T_F_IFB1141660858:0	AA	0.2421619	0.03211636	3.82294	0.004441747	-0.8163843MitoA13781G-13273301_T_F_IFB1141687043:0	AA	0.2897074	0.04604118	0.3798341	0	-1.746085MitoA14234G-13273304_T_F_IFB1141674277:0	AA	0.3183387	0.01525796	2.09793	0	-0.657663MitoA14583G-13273306_T_F_IFB1141688843:0	AA	0.329661	0.01146462	1.277739	0	-0.8274042MitoA15219G-13273311_T_F_IFB1141717824:0	AA	0.2827418	0.06994644	2.982398	0.01530516	-0.7913734MitoA15245G-13273312_B_R_IFB1141677374:0	AA	0.319456	0.03773752	1.77553	0	-0.6044052MitoA15302G-13273313_T_F_IFB1141686491:0	BB	0.272304	0.9202811	2.328026	1	-0.1870805MitoA15759G-13273316_B_R_IFB1141715135:0	AA	0.3397743	0.01326846	3.865201	0.001942605	-0.7159339MitoA15925G-13273318_T_F_IFB1141694300:0	AA	0.2903962	0.03071597	2.419281	0	-0.7036262MitoA16163G-13273319_T_F_IFB1141711520:0	AA	0.1848606	0.09911025	2.958352	0.06199134	-1.115526MitoA16164G-13273320_T_F_IFB1141715312:0	BB	0.3183387	0.9550413	1.829747	1	-0.3828983MitoA1738G-13273322_T_F_IFB1141639534:0	AA	0.2964002	0.019201	3.663078	0	-0.741245MitoA3349G-13273328_T_F_IFB1141711832:0	AA	0.2904017	0.04797894	4.461424	0.01950145	-0.6588835!sample_table_end
