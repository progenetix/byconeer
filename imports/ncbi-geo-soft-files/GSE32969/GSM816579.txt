DNA from the tumor samples was isolated using the Genomic-tips 20/G kit (Qiagen). A salting-out procedure was used to isolate genomic DNA from the peripheral blood samples. DNA was quantified using a Nanodrop (NanoDrop technologies) and evaluated for degradation on agarose gel.!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 400 ng of genomic DNA was labelled according to Illumina's standard protocol!Sample_hyb_protocol = Hybridizations were performed at the Leiden Genome Technology Center according to the manufacturer's instructions!Sample_scan_protocol = The beadChips were scanned using the Illumina BeadArray Reader, using the standard Illumina scanning protocol!Sample_data_processing = Image analysis and quality control (call rate > 98%) was performed in Illumina's BeadStudio Version 3.2 software using the genotyping module. Each BeadChip was self-normalized using information contained within the array. Further analysis and visualization was performed with the Illumina Genome Viewer in Beadstudio. First, tumor data was paired with data from their corresponding normal control. Subsequently, examination of the log R ratio (signal intensity tumor/signal intensity normal control) and B allele frequency (BAF) was analyzed for the presence of copy number variations (CNVs) and/or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumor samples. By plotting the log R ratio across a chromosome, CNVs could be visualized by an increase or decrease in baseline signal. Secondly, the BAF was plotted across each chromosome to detect regions of LOH in tumor cells. A region with LOH was defined as a stretch of heterozygous SNPs in normal DNA but homozygous in the matched tumor DNA.!Sample_data_processing = Matrix signal (ie, The signal intensities of all SNPs for each sample) is linked as a supplementary file on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6982!Sample_contact_name = Harry,,Vrieling!Sample_contact_email = h.vrieling@lumc.nl!Sample_contact_laboratory = room T4-34!Sample_contact_department = Toxicogenetics, S4-P!Sample_contact_institute = Leiden University Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = Einthovenweg 20!Sample_contact_city = Leiden!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 2333 ZC!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE32969!Sample_series_id = GSE32979!Sample_data_row_count = 561466#ID_REF = #VALUE = Gtype (Genotype)#BLD1_P.40.Score = #BLD1_P.40.Theta = #BLD1_P.40.R = #BLD1_P.40.B.Allele.Freq = #BLD1_P.40.Log.R.Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BLD1_P.40.Score	BLD1_P.40.Theta	BLD1_P.40.R	BLD1_P.40.B.Allele.Freq	BLD1_P.40.Log.R.RatioMitoA10045G-13273284_B_R_IFB1141652022:0	AA	0.3177595	0.001651971	3.039448	0	-0.5870423MitoA10551G-13273286_T_F_IFB1141639111:0	AA	0.298474	0.01347514	4.213185	0	-0.4104607MitoA11252G-13273288_B_R_IFB1141661584:0	AA	0.329167	0.01102644	4.824032	0	-0.2585969MitoA11468G-13273289_B_R_IFB1141719645:0	AA	0.3187215	0.007339197	5.579197	0	-0.1874737MitoA11813G-13273292_T_F_IFB1141667833:0	AA	0.2514375	0.03214683	3.975431	0	-0.3871066MitoA12309G-13273294_T_F_IFB1141664161:0	AA	0.2884996	0.01422572	3.602189	0	-0.4585886MitoA13106G-13273298_B_R_IFB1141641623:0	AA	0.3484128	0.04718216	1.536164	0.02791063	-0.02932876MitoA13264G-13273299_T_F_IFB1141660858:0	AA	0.2567114	0.01799012	5.151387	0	-0.386106MitoA13781G-13273301_T_F_IFB1141687043:0	AA	0.3341382	0.06246752	0.5204982	0.01620688	-1.291562MitoA14234G-13273304_T_F_IFB1141674277:0	AA	0.3183387	0.009461981	2.342282	0	-0.4987152MitoA14583G-13273306_T_F_IFB1141688843:0	AA	0.329661	0.005373486	1.805604	0	-0.3285162MitoA15219G-13273311_T_F_IFB1141717824:0	AA	0.290874	0.05605075	3.647367	0	-0.5009904MitoA15245G-13273312_B_R_IFB1141677374:0	AA	0.319456	0.03697276	2.471276	0	-0.127399MitoA15302G-13273313_T_F_IFB1141686491:0	BB	0.2735513	0.8904601	2.633177	1	-0.1605292MitoA15759G-13273316_B_R_IFB1141715135:0	AA	0.3469829	0.006766311	4.692899	0	-0.4359978MitoA15925G-13273318_T_F_IFB1141694300:0	AA	0.2904017	0.02300038	3.716086	0	-0.08442078MitoA16163G-13273319_T_F_IFB1141711520:0	AA	0.2527641	0.04397492	4.643139	0	-0.4652195MitoA16164G-13273320_T_F_IFB1141715312:0	AA	0.3183387	0.00939798	3.135026	0	-0.519355MitoA1738G-13273322_T_F_IFB1141639534:0	AA	0.3015448	0.008237256	4.757493	0	-0.3640997MitoA3349G-13273328_T_F_IFB1141711832:0	AA	0.2904017	0.02058293	5.856131	0	-0.2664399!sample_table_end
