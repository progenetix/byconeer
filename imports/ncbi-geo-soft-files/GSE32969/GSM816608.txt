DNA from the tumor samples was isolated using the Genomic-tips 20/G kit (Qiagen). A salting-out procedure was used to isolate genomic DNA from the peripheral blood samples. DNA was quantified using a Nanodrop (NanoDrop technologies) and evaluated for degradation on agarose gel.!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 400 ng of genomic DNA was labelled according to Illumina's standard protocol!Sample_hyb_protocol = Hybridizations were performed at the Leiden Genome Technology Center according to the manufacturer's instructions!Sample_scan_protocol = The beadChips were scanned using the Illumina BeadArray Reader, using the standard Illumina scanning protocol!Sample_data_processing = Image analysis and quality control (call rate > 98%) was performed in Illumina's BeadStudio Version 3.2 software using the genotyping module. Each BeadChip was self-normalized using information contained within the array. Further analysis and visualization was performed with the Illumina Genome Viewer in Beadstudio. First, tumor data was paired with data from their corresponding normal control. Subsequently, examination of the log R ratio (signal intensity tumor/signal intensity normal control) and B allele frequency (BAF) was analyzed for the presence of copy number variations (CNVs) and/or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumor samples. By plotting the log R ratio across a chromosome, CNVs could be visualized by an increase or decrease in baseline signal. Secondly, the BAF was plotted across each chromosome to detect regions of LOH in tumor cells. A region with LOH was defined as a stretch of heterozygous SNPs in normal DNA but homozygous in the matched tumor DNA.!Sample_data_processing = Matrix signal (ie, The signal intensities of all SNPs for each sample) is linked as a supplementary file on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6982!Sample_contact_name = Harry,,Vrieling!Sample_contact_email = h.vrieling@lumc.nl!Sample_contact_laboratory = room T4-34!Sample_contact_department = Toxicogenetics, S4-P!Sample_contact_institute = Leiden University Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = Einthovenweg 20!Sample_contact_city = Leiden!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 2333 ZC!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE32969!Sample_series_id = GSE32979!Sample_data_row_count = 561466#ID_REF = #VALUE = Gtype (Genotype)#AK_P.39.Score = #AK_P.39.Theta = #AK_P.39.R = #AK_P.39.B.Allele.Freq = #AK_P.39.Log.R.Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	AK_P.39.Score	AK_P.39.Theta	AK_P.39.R	AK_P.39.B.Allele.Freq	AK_P.39.Log.R.RatioMitoA10045G-13273284_B_R_IFB1141652022:0	AA	0.3155305	0.007867349	2.99043	0.002309324	-0.610499MitoA10551G-13273286_T_F_IFB1141639111:0	AA	0.298474	0.03313169	3.900943	0.01066859	-0.5215489MitoA11252G-13273288_B_R_IFB1141661584:0	BB	0.329167	0.9648845	1.975139	1	-0.3388596MitoA11468G-13273289_B_R_IFB1141719645:0	AA	0.3184274	0.02508215	3.784564	0.008206412	-0.7202325MitoA11813G-13273292_T_F_IFB1141667833:0	AA	0.2514375	0.07272567	3.5884	0.03340916	-0.5348773MitoA12309G-13273294_T_F_IFB1141664161:0	AA	0.2824665	0.03430251	2.987638	0.01403533	-0.7284574MitoA13106G-13273298_B_R_IFB1141641623:0	AA	0.3484127	0.04012477	1.022412	0.01993486	-0.6166843MitoA13264G-13273299_T_F_IFB1141660858:0	AA	0.2379294	0.04274594	3.744528	0.01658098	-0.846283MitoA13781G-13273301_T_F_IFB1141687043:0	AA	0.3457177	0.053978	0.7643788	0.006175851	-0.737167MitoA14234G-13273304_T_F_IFB1141674277:0	AA	0.3179462	0.02140138	1.618009	0.004014526	-1.03241MitoA14583G-13273306_T_F_IFB1141688843:0	AA	0.329661	0.01059421	1.28803	0	-0.8158321MitoA15219G-13273311_T_F_IFB1141717824:0	AA	0.290874	0.09027166	3.305106	0.03964562	-0.6431494MitoA15245G-13273312_B_R_IFB1141677374:0	AA	0.2345926	0.06242279	1.272561	0.02531017	-1.08492MitoA15302G-13273313_T_F_IFB1141686491:0	BB	0.2735513	0.8945648	2.475455	1	-0.2297519MitoA15759G-13273316_B_R_IFB1141715135:0	AA	0.346881	0.02091348	4.128053	0.01043523	-0.6210157MitoA15925G-13273318_T_F_IFB1141694300:0	AA	0.2904017	0.04298154	2.662901	0.01329856	-0.5652061MitoA16163G-13273319_T_F_IFB1141711520:0	AA	0.2429359	0.09428684	4.102324	0.05631475	-0.6438786MitoA16164G-13273320_T_F_IFB1141715312:0	AA	0.3183387	0.02405482	2.841846	0.008118609	-0.6610041MitoA1738G-13273322_T_F_IFB1141639534:0	AA	0.299825	0.02939693	3.779329	0.01056169	-0.6961713MitoA3349G-13273328_T_F_IFB1141711832:0	AA	0.2904017	0.05970565	4.347031	0.03295094	-0.6963573!sample_table_end
