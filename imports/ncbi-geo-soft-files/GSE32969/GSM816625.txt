DNA from the tumor samples was isolated using the Genomic-tips 20/G kit (Qiagen). A salting-out procedure was used to isolate genomic DNA from the peripheral blood samples. DNA was quantified using a Nanodrop (NanoDrop technologies) and evaluated for degradation on agarose gel.!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 400 ng of genomic DNA was labelled according to Illumina's standard protocol!Sample_hyb_protocol = Hybridizations were performed at the Leiden Genome Technology Center according to the manufacturer's instructions!Sample_scan_protocol = The beadChips were scanned using the Illumina BeadArray Reader, using the standard Illumina scanning protocol!Sample_data_processing = Image analysis and quality control (call rate > 98%) was performed in Illumina's BeadStudio Version 3.2 software using the genotyping module. Each BeadChip was self-normalized using information contained within the array. Further analysis and visualization was performed with the Illumina Genome Viewer in Beadstudio. First, tumor data was paired with data from their corresponding normal control. Subsequently, examination of the log R ratio (signal intensity tumor/signal intensity normal control) and B allele frequency (BAF) was analyzed for the presence of copy number variations (CNVs) and/or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumor samples. By plotting the log R ratio across a chromosome, CNVs could be visualized by an increase or decrease in baseline signal. Secondly, the BAF was plotted across each chromosome to detect regions of LOH in tumor cells. A region with LOH was defined as a stretch of heterozygous SNPs in normal DNA but homozygous in the matched tumor DNA.!Sample_data_processing = Matrix signal (ie, The signal intensities of all SNPs for each sample) is linked as a supplementary file on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6982!Sample_contact_name = Harry,,Vrieling!Sample_contact_email = h.vrieling@lumc.nl!Sample_contact_laboratory = room T4-34!Sample_contact_department = Toxicogenetics, S4-P!Sample_contact_institute = Leiden University Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = Einthovenweg 20!Sample_contact_city = Leiden!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 2333 ZC!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE32969!Sample_series_id = GSE32979!Sample_data_row_count = 561466#ID_REF = #VALUE = Gtype (Genotype)#BLD1_P.33.Score = #BLD1_P.33.Theta = #BLD1_P.33.R = #BLD1_P.33.B.Allele.Freq = #BLD1_P.33.Log.R.Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BLD1_P.33.Score	BLD1_P.33.Theta	BLD1_P.33.R	BLD1_P.33.B.Allele.Freq	BLD1_P.33.Log.R.RatioMitoA10045G-13273284_B_R_IFB1141652022:0	AA	0.2932752	0.003166112	2.750297	0	-0.7312644MitoA10551G-13273286_T_F_IFB1141639111:0	NC	0.1472013	0.9524831	1.906266	1	-1.554622MitoA11252G-13273288_B_R_IFB1141661584:0	AA	0.329167	0.01420418	3.788224	0	-0.6073149MitoA11468G-13273289_B_R_IFB1141719645:0	BB	0.2679576	0.9157622	1.625527	0.959323	-0.7902188MitoA11813G-13273292_T_F_IFB1141667833:0	AA	0.2496355	0.04444309	3.131299	0.0002385586	-0.7314565MitoA12309G-13273294_T_F_IFB1141664161:0	BB	0.285826	0.9330724	1.936648	1	-0.4309089MitoA13106G-13273298_B_R_IFB1141641623:0	AA	0.3484128	0.03221266	1.091362	0.01099312	-0.5225312MitoA13264G-13273299_T_F_IFB1141660858:0	AA	0.2506209	0.02372763	4.022561	0	-0.7429526MitoA13781G-13273301_T_F_IFB1141687043:0	NC	0.0879938	0.124715	0.1695028	0.08975714	-2.910146MitoA14234G-13273304_T_F_IFB1141674277:0	AA	0.3183387	0.01319474	1.969168	0	-0.7490435MitoA14583G-13273306_T_F_IFB1141688843:0	AA	0.329661	0.009955762	1.27754	0	-0.827629MitoA15219G-13273311_T_F_IFB1141717824:0	AA	0.2889426	0.06327954	3.138939	0.007321218	-0.717569MitoA15245G-13273312_B_R_IFB1141677374:0	AA	0.2679841	0.03823453	1.391039	0	-0.9564925MitoA15302G-13273313_T_F_IFB1141686491:0	BB	0.263163	0.9252487	2.208036	1	-0.2366323MitoA15759G-13273316_B_R_IFB1141715135:0	AA	0.3458843	0.0100265	4.047354	0	-0.6494982MitoA15925G-13273318_T_F_IFB1141694300:0	AA	0.2899901	0.02769037	2.370628	0	-0.7329354MitoA16163G-13273319_T_F_IFB1141711520:0	AA	0.2527641	0.06724837	4.289881	0.02449362	-0.5793824MitoA16164G-13273320_T_F_IFB1141715312:0	AA	0.3180686	0.01508202	2.666415	0	-0.7529306MitoA1738G-13273322_T_F_IFB1141639534:0	AA	0.2996645	0.01699359	3.772081	0	-0.6989406MitoA3349G-13273328_T_F_IFB1141711832:0	AA	0.2904017	0.03941155	5.119473	0.009675425	-0.4603924!sample_table_end
