DNA from the tumor samples was isolated using the Genomic-tips 20/G kit (Qiagen). A salting-out procedure was used to isolate genomic DNA from the peripheral blood samples. DNA was quantified using a Nanodrop (NanoDrop technologies) and evaluated for degradation on agarose gel.!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 400 ng of genomic DNA was labelled according to Illumina's standard protocol!Sample_hyb_protocol = Hybridizations were performed at the Leiden Genome Technology Center according to the manufacturer's instructions!Sample_scan_protocol = The beadChips were scanned using the Illumina BeadArray Reader, using the standard Illumina scanning protocol!Sample_data_processing = Image analysis and quality control (call rate > 98%) was performed in Illumina's BeadStudio Version 3.2 software using the genotyping module. Each BeadChip was self-normalized using information contained within the array. Further analysis and visualization was performed with the Illumina Genome Viewer in Beadstudio. First, tumor data was paired with data from their corresponding normal control. Subsequently, examination of the log R ratio (signal intensity tumor/signal intensity normal control) and B allele frequency (BAF) was analyzed for the presence of copy number variations (CNVs) and/or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumor samples. By plotting the log R ratio across a chromosome, CNVs could be visualized by an increase or decrease in baseline signal. Secondly, the BAF was plotted across each chromosome to detect regions of LOH in tumor cells. A region with LOH was defined as a stretch of heterozygous SNPs in normal DNA but homozygous in the matched tumor DNA.!Sample_data_processing = Matrix signal (ie, The signal intensities of all SNPs for each sample) is linked as a supplementary file on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6982!Sample_contact_name = Harry,,Vrieling!Sample_contact_email = h.vrieling@lumc.nl!Sample_contact_laboratory = room T4-34!Sample_contact_department = Toxicogenetics, S4-P!Sample_contact_institute = Leiden University Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = Einthovenweg 20!Sample_contact_city = Leiden!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 2333 ZC!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE32969!Sample_series_id = GSE32979!Sample_data_row_count = 561466#ID_REF = #VALUE = Gtype (Genotype)#BLD1_P.05.Score = #BLD1_P.05.Theta = #BLD1_P.05.R = #BLD1_P.05.B.Allele.Freq = #BLD1_P.05.Log.R.Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	BLD1_P.05.Score	BLD1_P.05.Theta	BLD1_P.05.R	BLD1_P.05.B.Allele.Freq	BLD1_P.05.Log.R.RatioMitoA10045G-13273284_B_R_IFB1141652022:0	AA	0.2635477	0.004394651	2.556854	0	-0.836482MitoA10551G-13273286_T_F_IFB1141639111:0	AA	0.2907292	0.02347779	3.216796	0	-0.7997473MitoA11252G-13273288_B_R_IFB1141661584:0	BB	0.329167	0.9800797	2.03688	1	-0.236004MitoA11468G-13273289_B_R_IFB1141719645:0	AA	0.3066932	0.01867016	3.400923	0.002053087	-0.8843118MitoA11813G-13273292_T_F_IFB1141667833:0	AA	0.2480321	0.06189948	3.071121	0.02071191	-0.7594525MitoA12309G-13273294_T_F_IFB1141664161:0	AA	0.2545492	0.02122453	2.643864	0	-0.9048145MitoA13106G-13273298_B_R_IFB1141641623:0	AA	0.3484128	0.02435854	1.274748	0.002116928	-0.2984492MitoA13264G-13273299_T_F_IFB1141660858:0	AA	0.2461303	0.03341016	3.906749	0.005919298	-0.7850984MitoA13781G-13273301_T_F_IFB1141687043:0	AA	0.3129933	0.05288627	0.4421484	0.004885887	-1.526924MitoA14234G-13273304_T_F_IFB1141674277:0	AA	0.3183387	0.01826232	1.992662	0.0004911302	-0.731933MitoA14583G-13273306_T_F_IFB1141688843:0	AA	0.3296446	0.01191863	1.157946	0	-0.9694293MitoA15219G-13273311_T_F_IFB1141717824:0	AA	0.2232529	0.08022095	2.365075	0.0276094	-1.12596MitoA15245G-13273312_B_R_IFB1141677374:0	AA	0.22313	0.04786546	1.235189	0.0083691	-1.127923MitoA15302G-13273313_T_F_IFB1141686491:0	BB	0.2735513	0.9255613	2.458158	1	-0.08011575MitoA15759G-13273316_B_R_IFB1141715135:0	AA	0.3428046	0.01601789	3.936741	0.00499687	-0.6894752MitoA15925G-13273318_T_F_IFB1141694300:0	AA	0.2904017	0.0321679	2.678881	0.0008831324	-0.5565741MitoA16163G-13273319_T_F_IFB1141711520:0	AA	0.2249368	0.09575211	3.462055	0.05803921	-0.8886911MitoA16164G-13273320_T_F_IFB1141715312:0	BB	0.3183102	0.9503965	1.781272	1	-0.4336149MitoA1738G-13273322_T_F_IFB1141639534:0	AA	0.295683	0.02231883	3.644408	0.002588081	-0.7486171MitoA3349G-13273328_T_F_IFB1141711832:0	AA	0.2904017	0.04736132	4.623142	0.0187931	-0.6075141!sample_table_end
