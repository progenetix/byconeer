DNA from the tumor samples was isolated using the Genomic-tips 20/G kit (Qiagen). A salting-out procedure was used to isolate genomic DNA from the peripheral blood samples. DNA was quantified using a Nanodrop (NanoDrop technologies) and evaluated for degradation on agarose gel.!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 400 ng of genomic DNA was labelled according to Illumina's standard protocol!Sample_hyb_protocol = Hybridizations were performed at the Leiden Genome Technology Center according to the manufacturer's instructions!Sample_scan_protocol = The beadChips were scanned using the Illumina BeadArray Reader, using the standard Illumina scanning protocol!Sample_data_processing = Image analysis and quality control (call rate > 98%) was performed in Illumina's BeadStudio Version 3.2 software using the genotyping module. Each BeadChip was self-normalized using information contained within the array. Further analysis and visualization was performed with the Illumina Genome Viewer in Beadstudio. First, tumor data was paired with data from their corresponding normal control. Subsequently, examination of the log R ratio (signal intensity tumor/signal intensity normal control) and B allele frequency (BAF) was analyzed for the presence of copy number variations (CNVs) and/or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumor samples. By plotting the log R ratio across a chromosome, CNVs could be visualized by an increase or decrease in baseline signal. Secondly, the BAF was plotted across each chromosome to detect regions of LOH in tumor cells. A region with LOH was defined as a stretch of heterozygous SNPs in normal DNA but homozygous in the matched tumor DNA.!Sample_data_processing = Matrix signal (ie, The signal intensities of all SNPs for each sample) is linked as a supplementary file on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6982!Sample_contact_name = Harry,,Vrieling!Sample_contact_email = h.vrieling@lumc.nl!Sample_contact_laboratory = room T4-34!Sample_contact_department = Toxicogenetics, S4-P!Sample_contact_institute = Leiden University Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = Einthovenweg 20!Sample_contact_city = Leiden!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 2333 ZC!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE32969!Sample_series_id = GSE32979!Sample_data_row_count = 561466#ID_REF = #VALUE = Gtype (Genotype)#AK_P.11.Score = #AK_P.11.Theta = #AK_P.11.R = #AK_P.11.B.Allele.Freq = #AK_P.11.Log.R.Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	AK_P.11.Score	AK_P.11.Theta	AK_P.11.R	AK_P.11.B.Allele.Freq	AK_P.11.Log.R.RatioMitoA10045G-13273284_B_R_IFB1141652022:0	AA	0.3197343	0.00516321	3.36498	0	-0.4402538MitoA10551G-13273286_T_F_IFB1141639111:0	AA	0.298474	0.02763168	4.24897	0.004434579	-0.3982589MitoA11252G-13273288_B_R_IFB1141661584:0	BB	0.329167	0.9660033	2.226998	1	-0.1614901MitoA11468G-13273289_B_R_IFB1141719645:0	AA	0.3187215	0.0164651	3.949004	0	-0.6721309MitoA11813G-13273292_T_F_IFB1141667833:0	BB	0.2514375	0.9035904	2.333235	1	-0.01332483MitoA12309G-13273294_T_F_IFB1141664161:0	AA	0.2849647	0.02751921	3.044571	0.006370219	-0.7012235MitoA13106G-13273298_B_R_IFB1141641623:0	AA	0.3484128	0.02301815	1.42592	0.0006021115	-0.1367682MitoA13264G-13273299_T_F_IFB1141660858:0	AA	0.2567114	0.03021121	4.820327	0.00226602	-0.4819358MitoA13781G-13273301_T_F_IFB1141687043:0	AA	0.3457177	0.04905337	0.7372882	0.0003570191	-0.7892262MitoA14234G-13273304_T_F_IFB1141674277:0	BB	0.3183387	0.959021	1.540955	1	-0.2997918MitoA14583G-13273306_T_F_IFB1141688843:0	AA	0.329661	0.01154521	1.358064	0	-0.7394463MitoA15219G-13273311_T_F_IFB1141717824:0	AA	0.290874	0.07134826	3.455713	0.01698391	-0.5788625MitoA15245G-13273312_B_R_IFB1141677374:0	AA	0.3105179	0.05173063	1.611961	0.01286718	-0.7438385MitoA15302G-13273313_T_F_IFB1141686491:0	BB	0.2735513	0.9021531	2.828462	1	7.726785e-05MitoA15759G-13273316_B_R_IFB1141715135:0	AA	0.3469829	0.01874872	4.792627	0.008030473	-0.4056604MitoA15925G-13273318_T_F_IFB1141694300:0	AA	0.2904017	0.02618827	2.5276	0	-0.6404366MitoA16163G-13273319_T_F_IFB1141711520:0	AA	0.2525166	0.08767151	4.343197	0.04852928	-0.5615624MitoA16164G-13273320_T_F_IFB1141715312:0	AA	0.3183387	0.02190506	2.862213	0.005709675	-0.6507013MitoA1738G-13273322_T_F_IFB1141639534:0	AA	0.3015448	0.02433961	4.085997	0.004864531	-0.5836134MitoA3349G-13273328_T_F_IFB1141711832:0	AA	0.2904017	0.04546421	5.621398	0.01661728	-0.3254588!sample_table_end
