DNA from the tumor samples was isolated using the Genomic-tips 20/G kit (Qiagen). A salting-out procedure was used to isolate genomic DNA from the peripheral blood samples. DNA was quantified using a Nanodrop (NanoDrop technologies) and evaluated for degradation on agarose gel.!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 400 ng of genomic DNA was labelled according to Illumina's standard protocol!Sample_hyb_protocol = Hybridizations were performed at the Leiden Genome Technology Center according to the manufacturer's instructions!Sample_scan_protocol = The beadChips were scanned using the Illumina BeadArray Reader, using the standard Illumina scanning protocol!Sample_data_processing = Image analysis and quality control (call rate > 98%) was performed in Illumina's BeadStudio Version 3.2 software using the genotyping module. Each BeadChip was self-normalized using information contained within the array. Further analysis and visualization was performed with the Illumina Genome Viewer in Beadstudio. First, tumor data was paired with data from their corresponding normal control. Subsequently, examination of the log R ratio (signal intensity tumor/signal intensity normal control) and B allele frequency (BAF) was analyzed for the presence of copy number variations (CNVs) and/or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumor samples. By plotting the log R ratio across a chromosome, CNVs could be visualized by an increase or decrease in baseline signal. Secondly, the BAF was plotted across each chromosome to detect regions of LOH in tumor cells. A region with LOH was defined as a stretch of heterozygous SNPs in normal DNA but homozygous in the matched tumor DNA.!Sample_data_processing = Matrix signal (ie, The signal intensities of all SNPs for each sample) is linked as a supplementary file on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6982!Sample_contact_name = Harry,,Vrieling!Sample_contact_email = h.vrieling@lumc.nl!Sample_contact_laboratory = room T4-34!Sample_contact_department = Toxicogenetics, S4-P!Sample_contact_institute = Leiden University Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = Einthovenweg 20!Sample_contact_city = Leiden!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 2333 ZC!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE32969!Sample_series_id = GSE32979!Sample_data_row_count = 561466#ID_REF = #VALUE = Gtype (Genotype)#SCC_P.27.Score = #SCC_P.27.Theta = #SCC_P.27.R = #SCC_P.27.B.Allele.Freq = #SCC_P.27.Log.R.Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	SCC_P.27.Score	SCC_P.27.Theta	SCC_P.27.R	SCC_P.27.B.Allele.Freq	SCC_P.27.Log.R.RatioMitoA10045G-13273284_B_R_IFB1141652022:0	AA	0.28824	0.007540573	2.712795	0.0019497	-0.751072MitoA10551G-13273286_T_F_IFB1141639111:0	AA	0.294568	0.01629016	3.310378	0	-0.7583759MitoA11252G-13273288_B_R_IFB1141661584:0	BB	0.329167	0.9809031	2.211521	1	-0.1140898MitoA11468G-13273289_B_R_IFB1141719645:0	AA	0.3186752	0.01036394	3.827073	0	-0.7266938MitoA11813G-13273292_T_F_IFB1141667833:0	AA	0.2510637	0.04411788	3.218399	0	-0.6918747MitoA12309G-13273294_T_F_IFB1141664161:0	AA	0.2875704	0.01613239	3.134588	0	-0.6591866MitoA13106G-13273298_B_R_IFB1141641623:0	AA	0.3484128	0.02652581	1.496147	0.004566235	-0.06740897MitoA13264G-13273299_T_F_IFB1141660858:0	AA	0.2567114	0.02607876	4.532875	0	-0.5706405MitoA13781G-13273301_T_F_IFB1141687043:0	AA	0.3001134	0.04730437	0.4060315	0	-1.649863MitoA14234G-13273304_T_F_IFB1141674277:0	AA	0.3183387	0.01144005	2.138654	0	-0.6299268MitoA14583G-13273306_T_F_IFB1141688843:0	AA	0.329661	0.006933941	1.536814	0	-0.5610553MitoA15219G-13273311_T_F_IFB1141717824:0	AA	0.290874	0.05711787	3.30582	0	-0.6428376MitoA15245G-13273312_B_R_IFB1141677374:0	AA	0.319456	0.03194793	1.922488	0	-0.4896802MitoA15302G-13273313_T_F_IFB1141686491:0	BB	0.2733665	0.907993	2.366745	1	-0.2274943MitoA15759G-13273316_B_R_IFB1141715135:0	AA	0.3463731	0.01174802	4.076952	0.0002535888	-0.638986MitoA15925G-13273318_T_F_IFB1141694300:0	AA	0.2904017	0.01836495	2.947013	0	-0.4189513MitoA16163G-13273319_T_F_IFB1141711520:0	AA	0.2527641	0.0581546	4.051522	0.0137913	-0.6618561MitoA16164G-13273320_T_F_IFB1141715312:0	AA	0.3183387	0.01654972	2.827029	0	-0.6685454MitoA1738G-13273322_T_F_IFB1141639534:0	AA	0.3009309	0.01388178	3.843184	0	-0.6719992MitoA3349G-13273328_T_F_IFB1141711832:0	AA	0.2904017	0.03402579	4.80372	0.003498438	-0.5522355!sample_table_end
