DNA from the tumor samples was isolated using the Genomic-tips 20/G kit (Qiagen). A salting-out procedure was used to isolate genomic DNA from the peripheral blood samples. DNA was quantified using a Nanodrop (NanoDrop technologies) and evaluated for degradation on agarose gel.!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 400 ng of genomic DNA was labelled according to Illumina's standard protocol!Sample_hyb_protocol = Hybridizations were performed at the Leiden Genome Technology Center according to the manufacturer's instructions!Sample_scan_protocol = The beadChips were scanned using the Illumina BeadArray Reader, using the standard Illumina scanning protocol!Sample_data_processing = Image analysis and quality control (call rate > 98%) was performed in Illumina's BeadStudio Version 3.2 software using the genotyping module. Each BeadChip was self-normalized using information contained within the array. Further analysis and visualization was performed with the Illumina Genome Viewer in Beadstudio. First, tumor data was paired with data from their corresponding normal control. Subsequently, examination of the log R ratio (signal intensity tumor/signal intensity normal control) and B allele frequency (BAF) was analyzed for the presence of copy number variations (CNVs) and/or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumor samples. By plotting the log R ratio across a chromosome, CNVs could be visualized by an increase or decrease in baseline signal. Secondly, the BAF was plotted across each chromosome to detect regions of LOH in tumor cells. A region with LOH was defined as a stretch of heterozygous SNPs in normal DNA but homozygous in the matched tumor DNA.!Sample_data_processing = Matrix signal (ie, The signal intensities of all SNPs for each sample) is linked as a supplementary file on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6982!Sample_contact_name = Harry,,Vrieling!Sample_contact_email = h.vrieling@lumc.nl!Sample_contact_laboratory = room T4-34!Sample_contact_department = Toxicogenetics, S4-P!Sample_contact_institute = Leiden University Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = Einthovenweg 20!Sample_contact_city = Leiden!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 2333 ZC!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE32969!Sample_series_id = GSE32979!Sample_data_row_count = 561466#ID_REF = #VALUE = Gtype (Genotype)#AK_P.44.Score = #AK_P.44.Theta = #AK_P.44.R = #AK_P.44.B.Allele.Freq = #AK_P.44.Log.R.Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	AK_P.44.Score	AK_P.44.Theta	AK_P.44.R	AK_P.44.B.Allele.Freq	AK_P.44.Log.R.RatioMitoA10045G-13273284_B_R_IFB1141652022:0	AA	0.3197343	0.006666436	3.321226	0.0009876963	-0.4591359MitoA10551G-13273286_T_F_IFB1141639111:0	AA	0.298474	0.02978718	3.796787	0.006877737	-0.5605929MitoA11252G-13273288_B_R_IFB1141661584:0	AA	0.329167	0.02522841	4.183695	0.007584446	-0.4640587MitoA11468G-13273289_B_R_IFB1141719645:0	AA	0.3072057	0.02255042	3.410851	0.005776815	-0.8741366MitoA11813G-13273292_T_F_IFB1141667833:0	AA	0.2514375	0.06972992	3.552362	0.02989566	-0.5494394MitoA12309G-13273294_T_F_IFB1141664161:0	AA	0.2842497	0.03469663	3.026678	0.01448069	-0.7097273MitoA13106G-13273298_B_R_IFB1141641623:0	BB	0.3484128	0.9656177	0.9052626	1	-0.3583654MitoA13264G-13273299_T_F_IFB1141660858:0	AA	0.2449686	0.04504542	3.880887	0.01920703	-0.7946806MitoA13781G-13273301_T_F_IFB1141687043:0	AA	0.3457177	0.0534325	0.6976878	0.005531298	-0.8688732MitoA14234G-13273304_T_F_IFB1141674277:0	AA	0.3183387	0.02203554	1.916925	0.004726321	-0.7878362MitoA14583G-13273306_T_F_IFB1141688843:0	AA	0.3289135	0.01742091	1.115559	0.005526799	-1.02323MitoA15219G-13273311_T_F_IFB1141717824:0	AA	0.2789821	0.1034111	2.917739	0.05538071	-0.8229953MitoA15245G-13273312_B_R_IFB1141677374:0	AA	0.319456	0.06098806	2.120862	0.02364051	-0.348004MitoA15302G-13273313_T_F_IFB1141686491:0	BB	0.2671292	0.9089366	2.247589	1	-0.2971896MitoA15759G-13273316_B_R_IFB1141715135:0	AA	0.3469829	0.0227583	4.57538	0.0124846	-0.4725856MitoA15925G-13273318_T_F_IFB1141694300:0	AA	0.1906582	0.03015648	1.490876	0	-1.402045MitoA16163G-13273319_T_F_IFB1141711520:0	AA	0.2527641	0.07564653	4.8039	0.03437728	-0.4161139MitoA16164G-13273320_T_F_IFB1141715312:0	AA	0.3118001	0.02538002	2.472156	0.009603569	-0.8620626MitoA1738G-13273322_T_F_IFB1141639534:0	AA	0.3013187	0.02950555	3.880384	0.01068406	-0.6581019MitoA3349G-13273328_T_F_IFB1141711832:0	AA	0.2904017	0.05185221	5.159297	0.02394375	-0.4492132!sample_table_end
