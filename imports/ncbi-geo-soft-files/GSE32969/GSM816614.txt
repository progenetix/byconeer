DNA from the tumor samples was isolated using the Genomic-tips 20/G kit (Qiagen). A salting-out procedure was used to isolate genomic DNA from the peripheral blood samples. DNA was quantified using a Nanodrop (NanoDrop technologies) and evaluated for degradation on agarose gel.!Sample_label_ch1 = C-Bio and A-DNP!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = 400 ng of genomic DNA was labelled according to Illumina's standard protocol!Sample_hyb_protocol = Hybridizations were performed at the Leiden Genome Technology Center according to the manufacturer's instructions!Sample_scan_protocol = The beadChips were scanned using the Illumina BeadArray Reader, using the standard Illumina scanning protocol!Sample_data_processing = Image analysis and quality control (call rate > 98%) was performed in Illumina's BeadStudio Version 3.2 software using the genotyping module. Each BeadChip was self-normalized using information contained within the array. Further analysis and visualization was performed with the Illumina Genome Viewer in Beadstudio. First, tumor data was paired with data from their corresponding normal control. Subsequently, examination of the log R ratio (signal intensity tumor/signal intensity normal control) and B allele frequency (BAF) was analyzed for the presence of copy number variations (CNVs) and/or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumor samples. By plotting the log R ratio across a chromosome, CNVs could be visualized by an increase or decrease in baseline signal. Secondly, the BAF was plotted across each chromosome to detect regions of LOH in tumor cells. A region with LOH was defined as a stretch of heterozygous SNPs in normal DNA but homozygous in the matched tumor DNA.!Sample_data_processing = Matrix signal (ie, The signal intensities of all SNPs for each sample) is linked as a supplementary file on the Series record.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6982!Sample_contact_name = Harry,,Vrieling!Sample_contact_email = h.vrieling@lumc.nl!Sample_contact_laboratory = room T4-34!Sample_contact_department = Toxicogenetics, S4-P!Sample_contact_institute = Leiden University Medical Center!Sample_contact_address = Einthovenweg 20!Sample_contact_city = Leiden!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 2333 ZC!Sample_contact_country = Netherlands!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE32969!Sample_series_id = GSE32979!Sample_data_row_count = 561466#ID_REF = #VALUE = Gtype (Genotype)#AK_P.03.Score = #AK_P.03.Theta = #AK_P.03.R = #AK_P.03.B.Allele.Freq = #AK_P.03.Log.R.Ratio = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	AK_P.03.Score	AK_P.03.Theta	AK_P.03.R	AK_P.03.B.Allele.Freq	AK_P.03.Log.R.RatioMitoA10045G-13273284_B_R_IFB1141652022:0	AA	0.2861817	0.00511448	2.698223	0	-0.7588423MitoA10551G-13273286_T_F_IFB1141639111:0	AA	0.2938719	0.02964542	3.290846	0.00671706	-0.7669135MitoA11252G-13273288_B_R_IFB1141661584:0	AA	0.329167	0.02221996	3.927372	0.004204003	-0.5552719MitoA11468G-13273289_B_R_IFB1141719645:0	AA	0.3187215	0.01751212	4.057868	0.0009417674	-0.6312929MitoA11813G-13273292_T_F_IFB1141667833:0	AA	0.2514375	0.05639457	3.606955	0.01425559	-0.5274364MitoA12309G-13273294_T_F_IFB1141664161:0	AA	0.2884996	0.02277666	3.274556	0.001011148	-0.5961633MitoA13106G-13273298_B_R_IFB1141641623:0	AA	0.3484128	0.02752747	1.034451	0.005698245	-0.599795MitoA13264G-13273299_T_F_IFB1141660858:0	AA	0.2567114	0.03021981	4.970573	0.002275845	-0.4376546MitoA13781G-13273301_T_F_IFB1141687043:0	AA	0.3457177	0.05373937	0.7320229	0.005893885	-0.7995661MitoA14234G-13273304_T_F_IFB1141674277:0	AA	0.3183387	0.01928256	1.766449	0.001636287	-0.9057779MitoA14583G-13273306_T_F_IFB1141688843:0	AA	0.3207777	0.01488573	0.9929132	0.002706235	-1.191258MitoA15219G-13273311_T_F_IFB1141717824:0	AA	0.290874	0.06678253	3.687931	0.01151623	-0.4850345MitoA15245G-13273312_B_R_IFB1141677374:0	AA	0.319456	0.0499634	2.018138	0.01081057	-0.4196301MitoA15302G-13273313_T_F_IFB1141686491:0	BB	0.2735513	0.9096915	2.594576	1	-0.08619226MitoA15759G-13273316_B_R_IFB1141715135:0	AA	0.3469829	0.01692077	4.818878	0.005999853	-0.39778MitoA15925G-13273318_T_F_IFB1141694300:0	AA	0.2904017	0.03054621	3.270515	0	-0.268687MitoA16163G-13273319_T_F_IFB1141711520:0	AA	0.2527641	0.06277403	4.636373	0.01922784	-0.4673233MitoA16164G-13273320_T_F_IFB1141715312:0	AA	0.3183387	0.02170366	2.796983	0.005484	-0.6839604MitoA1738G-13273322_T_F_IFB1141639534:0	AA	0.3015448	0.02205767	4.593312	0.002293884	-0.4147666MitoA3349G-13273328_T_F_IFB1141711832:0	AA	0.2904017	0.04539585	5.149095	0.01653888	-0.4520688!sample_table_end
