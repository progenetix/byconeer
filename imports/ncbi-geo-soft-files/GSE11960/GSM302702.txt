The fluidics station model FS450 was used.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were hybridized according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using an Affymetrix model 640 hybridization oven.!Sample_scan_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were scanned according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using a GS3000 scanner.!Sample_description = Ovary tumors were profiled for copy-number alterations!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix 500K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by dChip 2005 (Build date Nov 30, 2005) using the PM/MM difference model and invariant set normalization.  Forty-eight normal samples were downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=500k) and analyzed at the same time.  One CEL file for each set (Sty and Nsp) with the median signal intensity across the set was selected as the reference array.   The dChip-normalized signal intensities were converted to log2 ratios and segmented as follows.  For each autosomal probe set, the log2 tumor/normal ratio of each tumor sample was calculated using the average intensity for each probe set in the normal set.  For Chromosome X, the average of the 20 normal female samples was used.   Each probe set was mapped to the genome, NCBI assembly version 35, using annotation provided by the Affymetrix web site.  The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and segmented using the GLAD package for the R statistical environment.  GLAD segments composed of < 8 probesets were merged with the neighboring segment with the most similar copy number.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM302nnn/GSM302702/suppl/GSM302702.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM302nnn/GSM302702/suppl/GSM302702.exp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE11960!Sample_data_row_count = 262263#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780618	1.939711213SNP_A-1780617	2.811864376SNP_A-1780778	1.656039953SNP_A-1780616	2.012667418SNP_A-1780613	2.913631439SNP_A-1780419	2.263913155SNP_A-1780612	2.216994047SNP_A-1780418	1.942632914SNP_A-1780611	5.398953915SNP_A-1780610	1.327498913SNP_A-1780415	1.942632914SNP_A-1780576	2.263913155SNP_A-1780413	1.654876709SNP_A-1780412	1.656039953SNP_A-1780574	2.266605377SNP_A-1780379	1.658316016SNP_A-1780572	1.348114371SNP_A-1780378	2.694668055SNP_A-1780377	1.907729864SNP_A-1780570	1.858879566!sample_table_end
