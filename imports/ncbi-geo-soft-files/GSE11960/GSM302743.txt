The fluidics station model FS450 was used.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were hybridized according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using an Affymetrix model 640 hybridization oven.!Sample_scan_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were scanned according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using a GS3000 scanner.!Sample_description = Ovary tumors were profiled for copy-number alterations!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix 500K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by dChip 2005 (Build date Nov 30, 2005) using the PM/MM difference model and invariant set normalization.  Forty-eight normal samples were downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=500k) and analyzed at the same time.  One CEL file for each set (Sty and Nsp) with the median signal intensity across the set was selected as the reference array.   The dChip-normalized signal intensities were converted to log2 ratios and segmented as follows.  For each autosomal probe set, the log2 tumor/normal ratio of each tumor sample was calculated using the average intensity for each probe set in the normal set.  For Chromosome X, the average of the 20 normal female samples was used.   Each probe set was mapped to the genome, NCBI assembly version 35, using annotation provided by the Affymetrix web site.  The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and segmented using the GLAD package for the R statistical environment.  GLAD segments composed of < 8 probesets were merged with the neighboring segment with the most similar copy number.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM302nnn/GSM302743/suppl/GSM302743.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM302nnn/GSM302743/suppl/GSM302743.exp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE11960!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780358	2.032688856SNP_A-1780551	1.989970207SNP_A-1780357	1.981396317SNP_A-1780550	1.986302972SNP_A-1780352	2.020956755SNP_A-1780351	1.211382508SNP_A-1780350	1.997761488SNP_A-1780748	2.030670166SNP_A-1780747	2.012088776SNP_A-1780746	2.012088776SNP_A-1780745	2.014331579SNP_A-1780743	1.994993448SNP_A-1780549	2.009051561SNP_A-1780547	2.010956764SNP_A-1780541	1.966421127SNP_A-1780346	2.006556749SNP_A-1780345	1.986134052SNP_A-1780342	1.992853642SNP_A-1780341	2.008750916SNP_A-1780340	2.014508486!sample_table_end
