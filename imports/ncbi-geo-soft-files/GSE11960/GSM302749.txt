The fluidics station model FS450 was used.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were hybridized according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using an Affymetrix model 640 hybridization oven.!Sample_scan_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were scanned according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using a GS3000 scanner.!Sample_description = Ovary tumors were profiled for copy-number alterations!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix 500K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by dChip 2005 (Build date Nov 30, 2005) using the PM/MM difference model and invariant set normalization.  Forty-eight normal samples were downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=500k) and analyzed at the same time.  One CEL file for each set (Sty and Nsp) with the median signal intensity across the set was selected as the reference array.   The dChip-normalized signal intensities were converted to log2 ratios and segmented as follows.  For each autosomal probe set, the log2 tumor/normal ratio of each tumor sample was calculated using the average intensity for each probe set in the normal set.  For Chromosome X, the average of the 20 normal female samples was used.   Each probe set was mapped to the genome, NCBI assembly version 35, using annotation provided by the Affymetrix web site.  The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and segmented using the GLAD package for the R statistical environment.  GLAD segments composed of < 8 probesets were merged with the neighboring segment with the most similar copy number.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3720!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM302nnn/GSM302749/suppl/GSM302749.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM302nnn/GSM302749/suppl/GSM302749.exp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE11960!Sample_data_row_count = 238304#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780358	2.08869648SNP_A-1780551	1.781355023SNP_A-1780357	1.677657247SNP_A-1780550	1.989749312SNP_A-1780352	1.776385427SNP_A-1780351	2.082342863SNP_A-1780350	2.013731003SNP_A-1780748	2.039997339SNP_A-1780747	2.075612307SNP_A-1780746	2.075612307SNP_A-1780745	1.82334435SNP_A-1780743	2.250499964SNP_A-1780549	2.08869648SNP_A-1780547	2.01128006SNP_A-1780541	1.708083987SNP_A-1780346	1.81208384SNP_A-1780345	2.032168627SNP_A-1780342	2.027880669SNP_A-1780341	1.552334547SNP_A-1780340	2.037730455!sample_table_end
