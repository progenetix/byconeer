REVIEW SHOWS ONLY SEROUS ADENOCARCINOMA., 75-90!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = A small piece of frozen tissue was removed from a sample of frozen tissue and incubated in a proteinase K digestion solution followed by cleanup using the Qiagen M48 robotics protocol.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Following restriction enzyme digestion, biotin labeled DNA was prepared according to the Affymetrix protocol from 500ng of starting DNA (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005). The fluidics station model FS450 was used.!Sample_hyb_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were hybridized according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using an Affymetrix model 640 hybridization oven.!Sample_scan_protocol = Mapping 500K arrays were scanned according to the Affymetrix protocol (GeneChip Mapping 500K Assay Manual, Affymetrix, 2005) using a GS3000 scanner.!Sample_description = Ovary tumors were profiled for copy-number alterations!Sample_data_processing = Affymetrix 500K Mapping Array intensity signal CEL files were processed by dChip 2005 (Build date Nov 30, 2005) using the PM/MM difference model and invariant set normalization.  Forty-eight normal samples were downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/byproduct.affx?product=500k) and analyzed at the same time.  One CEL file for each set (Sty and Nsp) with the median signal intensity across the set was selected as the reference array.   The dChip-normalized signal intensities were converted to log2 ratios and segmented as follows.  For each autosomal probe set, the log2 tumor/normal ratio of each tumor sample was calculated using the average intensity for each probe set in the normal set.  For Chromosome X, the average of the 20 normal female samples was used.   Each probe set was mapped to the genome, NCBI assembly version 35, using annotation provided by the Affymetrix web site.  The log2 ratios were centered to a median of zero and segmented using the GLAD package for the R statistical environment.  GLAD segments composed of < 8 probesets were merged with the neighboring segment with the most similar copy number.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Peter,,Haverty!Sample_contact_email = phaverty@gene.com!Sample_contact_department = Bioinformatics!Sample_contact_institute = Genentech, Inc.!Sample_contact_address = 1 DNA Way!Sample_contact_city = South San Francisco!Sample_contact_state = CA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 94080!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM302nnn/GSM302709/suppl/GSM302709.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM302nnn/GSM302709/suppl/GSM302709.exp.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE11960!Sample_data_row_count = 262263#ID_REF = #VALUE = GLAD segmented copy number!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUESNP_A-1780618	1.974782467SNP_A-1780617	2.388134003SNP_A-1780778	2.048033714SNP_A-1780616	2.020707607SNP_A-1780613	2.392880201SNP_A-1780419	2.362310171SNP_A-1780612	2.318236828SNP_A-1780418	1.767546415SNP_A-1780611	2.02837491SNP_A-1780610	2.400019407SNP_A-1780415	1.767546415SNP_A-1780576	2.362310171SNP_A-1780413	1.924658298SNP_A-1780412	1.767546415SNP_A-1780574	2.557934999SNP_A-1780379	2.228769779SNP_A-1780572	1.444504261SNP_A-1780378	2.141420364SNP_A-1780377	2.137758255SNP_A-1780570	1.965853572!sample_table_end
