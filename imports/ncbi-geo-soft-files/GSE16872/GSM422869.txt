Resuspend the probe in 45 uL hybridization solution (36 uL DIGeasy+ 4.5 uL (20mg/mL) sheared Herring Sperm DNA + 4.5 uL (10mg/mL) yeast tRNA). Denature the samples at 85Â°C  for 5min, and incubate at 45Â°C for 1 hour to allow Cot-1 to anneal to DNA probe. Add 45uL of the probe solution onto the array slide. Gently lower coverslip (22x60mm, Fisher Scientific) onto slide over probe solution. Place the slide into a pre-warmed (45Â°C) hybridization cassette (Telechem) and add 10uL of H20 in the lower groove (to control humidity). Incubate for 36 - 40hrs at 45Â°C.  Wash the slide with  0.1X SSC + 0.1% SDS (pH 7.0, pre-warmed to 45Â°C) for 5 minutes in the dark with agitation, and with 0.1X SCC 5 times. Dry the slides by centrifuging at 500rcf for 1 minute.!Sample_scan_protocol = We are currently using the Axon GenePix 4000B scanner.
