After incubation at 42C for 5 min, the mixture was applied to Whole Genome DNA Microarray (LinkGenomics) covered with a MAUI Mixer hybridization chamber (Biomicro systems). After incubation at 42C for 48 hours, the slides were then washed with 2xSSC/0.1%SDS buffer and 0.1xSSC/0.1%SDS buffer several times. After rinsing with 0.01xSSC buffer and air-drying.!Sample_scan_protocol = Slides were scanned immediately after washing on the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2505B) using two color scan setting (Scan resolution 10um, Dye channel is set to Red/Green and PMT is set to Hi 100%, Lo 10%).!Sample_description = Data was merged high (_100) and low (_10) PMT data!Sample_data_processing = Extract tif images using the Gene-Pix Pro 4.0 imaging software (Axon Instruments; Union City, CA, USA).
