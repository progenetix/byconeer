The concentrations and labeling efficiencies were measured with the Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Rockland, DE).!Sample_source_name_ch2 = 68!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = Normal male DNA!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Genomic DNA from patients as well as from healthy controls was isolated from bone marrow using the Wizard Genomic DNA purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and using manufacture's protocol.!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Genomic DNA was labeled with the Bioprime DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using Cy3-labelled dCTP's (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) as described by the manufacturer. The concentrations and labeling efficiencies were measured with the Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Rockland, DE).!Sample_hyb_protocol = For each hybridisation, 3 mg each of the Cy5- and Cy3- labeled probes, with a specific activity of 40 were mixed together with 100 Âµg Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Probe preparation, pre-blocking and washing of the slides was performed as described previously (Van Buggenhout G, et al. 2004. J. Med. Genet. 41: 691-698).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned at 532 nm (Cy3) and 635 nm (Cy5) using the Genepix 4 scanner (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) and acquired images were analysed using the ArrayVision software (Imaging Research Inc., Ontario, Canada).!Sample_description = Array-CGH of patient with T-ALL!Sample_data_processing = Spot intensities were corrected for local background and only those spots with Cy5 as well as Cy3 signal intensities at least 1.7-fold above the local background, were further analysed. For each clone, a ratio of Cy3 to Cy5 fluorescent intensity was calculated. Normalization of the data was achieved by dividing the fluorescent intensity ratio of each spot by the mean of the ratios of the autosomes. Finally, the normalized ratio values of the duplicates were averaged and a log2 value was calculated. Datapoints for which the variation between the two intensity ratios was larger than 10% were excluded from the analysis.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4939!Sample_contact_name = Rekin's,,Janky!Sample_contact_email = Nucleomics.Bioinformatics@vib.be!Sample_contact_phone = +32(0)16 37 31 26!Sample_contact_department = Nucleomics Core!Sample_contact_institute = VIB!Sample_contact_address = Herestraat 49 Box 816!Sample_contact_city = Leuven!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = B-3000!Sample_contact_country = Belgium!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM174nnn/GSM174621/suppl/GSM174621.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE7239!Sample_data_row_count = 8736
