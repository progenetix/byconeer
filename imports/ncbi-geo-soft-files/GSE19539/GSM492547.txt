Lymphocytic DNA was extracted from stored blood samples.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = 10uM slices of tumour were hand-microdissected to obtain regions with >80% epithelial cells and reduce contamination from fibroblasts, blood vessels etc. Following this, for DNA extraction, slides containing sections were stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin and DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNEasy kit. For RNA, identical slides were stained with Cresyl violet and total RNA was extracted using the Ambion mirVana kit according to manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = According to Affymetrix protocol, Biotin labelled!Sample_hyb_protocol = According to Affymetrix protocol using recommended instrumentation!Sample_scan_protocol = According to Affymetrix protocol and using GeneChip Operating Software!Sample_description = none!Sample_data_processing = primary data description: Partek's copy number workflow generates copy number ratios relative to matching normal samples or a pooled baseline and then converts and presents these values as whole copy numbers. The file titled SNP6_Normalised-Copy-number.csv contains these values for each sample. In this file, probes on Chromosome Y and the Mitochondrion (MT) have been removed and the probesets are organised first by Chromosome and then by start position. Annotations for this were mapped in Partek using the Affymetrix GenomewideSNP6, CN and SNP annotation files, release number 23. This data was then used for Segmentation using the CBS algorithm in the DNAcopy package in R open-source software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Manasa,,Ramakrishna!Sample_contact_email = manasa.ramakrishna@petermac.org!Sample_contact_institute = Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = St Andrew's Pl!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = Victoria!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 3002!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM492nnn/GSM492547/suppl/GSM492547_P1854T.CEL.gz!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSE58579!Sample_series_id = GSE19539!Sample_data_row_count = 1870003#ID_REF = #VALUE = ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUECN_473963	1.9614299535751CN_473964	2.0097799301147CN_473965	2.4004700183868CN_477984	1.1168700456619CN_473981	2.3679299354553CN_473982	2.4394800662994CN_497980	1.7006200551987CN_497981	2.6389501094818CN_513369	2.0028200149536CN_513370	1.6332199573517CN_517762	1.5224499702454CN_517763	1.913409948349CN_502615	1.6025500297546CN_502613	2.0206100940704CN_502614	2.9098300933838CN_502616	3.2326900959015CN_502842	2.7028601169586CN_502843	2.1624898910522CN_466171	2.0987200737CN_466172	1.8237400054932!sample_table_end
