Lymphocytic DNA was extracted from stored blood samples.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = 10uM slices of tumour were hand-microdissected to obtain regions with >80% epithelial cells and reduce contamination from fibroblasts, blood vessels etc. Following this, for DNA extraction, slides containing sections were stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin and DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNEasy kit. For RNA, identical slides were stained with Cresyl violet and total RNA was extracted using the Ambion mirVana kit according to manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = According to Affymetrix protocol, Biotin labelled!Sample_hyb_protocol = According to Affymetrix protocol using recommended instrumentation!Sample_scan_protocol = According to Affymetrix protocol and using GeneChip Operating Software!Sample_description = none!Sample_data_processing = primary data description: Partek's copy number workflow generates copy number ratios relative to matching normal samples or a pooled baseline and then converts and presents these values as whole copy numbers. The file titled SNP6_Normalised-Copy-number.csv contains these values for each sample. In this file, probes on Chromosome Y and the Mitochondrion (MT) have been removed and the probesets are organised first by Chromosome and then by start position. Annotations for this were mapped in Partek using the Affymetrix GenomewideSNP6, CN and SNP annotation files, release number 23. This data was then used for Segmentation using the CBS algorithm in the DNAcopy package in R open-source software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Manasa,,Ramakrishna!Sample_contact_email = manasa.ramakrishna@petermac.org!Sample_contact_institute = Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = St Andrew's Pl!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = Victoria!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 3002!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM492nnn/GSM492502/suppl/GSM492502_IC179N.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM492nnn/GSM492502/suppl/GSM492502_IC179T.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE19539!Sample_data_row_count = 1870003#ID_REF = #VALUE = ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUECN_473963	2.548369884491CN_473964	2.1109299659729CN_473965	1.9827100038528CN_477984	1.3243299722672CN_473981	2.5420799255371CN_473982	2.0993299484253CN_497980	1.5110100507736CN_497981	1.7708599567413CN_513369	1.2714899778366CN_513370	1.8793400526047CN_517762	1.4960000514984CN_517763	1.4532099962234CN_502615	2.3247001171112CN_502613	2.0105199813843CN_502614	3.8102099895477CN_502616	2.6426999568939CN_502842	1.5767199993134CN_502843	2.439090013504CN_466171	2.242259979248CN_466172	1.7432099580765!sample_table_end
