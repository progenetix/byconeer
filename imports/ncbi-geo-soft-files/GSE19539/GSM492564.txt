Lymphocytic DNA was extracted from stored blood samples.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = 10uM slices of tumour were hand-microdissected to obtain regions with >80% epithelial cells and reduce contamination from fibroblasts, blood vessels etc. Following this, for DNA extraction, slides containing sections were stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin and DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNEasy kit. For RNA, identical slides were stained with Cresyl violet and total RNA was extracted using the Ambion mirVana kit according to manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = According to Affymetrix protocol, Biotin labelled!Sample_hyb_protocol = According to Affymetrix protocol using recommended instrumentation!Sample_scan_protocol = According to Affymetrix protocol and using GeneChip Operating Software!Sample_description = none!Sample_data_processing = primary data description: Partek's copy number workflow generates copy number ratios relative to matching normal samples or a pooled baseline and then converts and presents these values as whole copy numbers. The file titled SNP6_Normalised-Copy-number.csv contains these values for each sample. In this file, probes on Chromosome Y and the Mitochondrion (MT) have been removed and the probesets are organised first by Chromosome and then by start position. Annotations for this were mapped in Partek using the Affymetrix GenomewideSNP6, CN and SNP annotation files, release number 23. This data was then used for Segmentation using the CBS algorithm in the DNAcopy package in R open-source software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Manasa,,Ramakrishna!Sample_contact_email = manasa.ramakrishna@petermac.org!Sample_contact_institute = Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = St Andrew's Pl!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = Victoria!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 3002!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM492nnn/GSM492564/suppl/GSM492564_P4684N.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM492nnn/GSM492564/suppl/GSM492564_P4684T.CEL.gz!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSE58579!Sample_series_id = GSE19539!Sample_data_row_count = 1870003#ID_REF = #VALUE = ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUECN_473963	2.4317500591278CN_473964	1.1902199983597CN_473965	1.2864899635315CN_477984	1.1396700143814CN_473981	1.8880599737167CN_473982	0.99546998739243CN_497980	1.4314299821854CN_497981	1.1588100194931CN_513369	1.0893700122833CN_513370	2.2219200134277CN_517762	1.162260055542CN_517763	1.5684100389481CN_502615	0.76241797208786CN_502613	2.4386200904846CN_502614	1.1104300022125CN_502616	1.1971000432968CN_502842	1.4466400146484CN_502843	1.1214300394058CN_466171	1.9802399873734CN_466172	2.1668400764465!sample_table_end
