Lymphocytic DNA was extracted from stored blood samples.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = 10uM slices of tumour were hand-microdissected to obtain regions with >80% epithelial cells and reduce contamination from fibroblasts, blood vessels etc. Following this, for DNA extraction, slides containing sections were stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin and DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNEasy kit. For RNA, identical slides were stained with Cresyl violet and total RNA was extracted using the Ambion mirVana kit according to manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = According to Affymetrix protocol, Biotin labelled!Sample_hyb_protocol = According to Affymetrix protocol using recommended instrumentation!Sample_scan_protocol = According to Affymetrix protocol and using GeneChip Operating Software!Sample_description = none!Sample_data_processing = primary data description: Partek's copy number workflow generates copy number ratios relative to matching normal samples or a pooled baseline and then converts and presents these values as whole copy numbers. The file titled SNP6_Normalised-Copy-number.csv contains these values for each sample. In this file, probes on Chromosome Y and the Mitochondrion (MT) have been removed and the probesets are organised first by Chromosome and then by start position. Annotations for this were mapped in Partek using the Affymetrix GenomewideSNP6, CN and SNP annotation files, release number 23. This data was then used for Segmentation using the CBS algorithm in the DNAcopy package in R open-source software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Manasa,,Ramakrishna!Sample_contact_email = manasa.ramakrishna@petermac.org!Sample_contact_institute = Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = St Andrew's Pl!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = Victoria!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 3002!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM492nnn/GSM492507/suppl/GSM492507_IC288N.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM492nnn/GSM492507/suppl/GSM492507_IC288T.CEL.gz!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSE58579!Sample_series_id = GSE19539!Sample_data_row_count = 1870003#ID_REF = #VALUE = ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUECN_473963	1.4311800003052CN_473964	2.295459985733CN_473965	1.4640100002289CN_477984	1.7263200283051CN_473981	1.9239399433136CN_473982	1.6377099752426CN_497980	1.9593499898911CN_497981	1.5678600072861CN_513369	2.0699300765991CN_513370	1.4378399848938CN_517762	1.7229599952698CN_517763	1.7182999849319CN_502615	3.0941200256348CN_502613	1.0564999580383CN_502614	1.9556299448013CN_502616	2.5459001064301CN_502842	1.1466000080109CN_502843	1.7625600099564CN_466171	1.5502699613571CN_466172	2.6933200359344!sample_table_end
