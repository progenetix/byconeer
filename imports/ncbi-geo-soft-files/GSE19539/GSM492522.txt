Lymphocytic DNA was extracted from stored blood samples.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = 10uM slices of tumour were hand-microdissected to obtain regions with >80% epithelial cells and reduce contamination from fibroblasts, blood vessels etc. Following this, for DNA extraction, slides containing sections were stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin and DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNEasy kit. For RNA, identical slides were stained with Cresyl violet and total RNA was extracted using the Ambion mirVana kit according to manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = According to Affymetrix protocol, Biotin labelled!Sample_hyb_protocol = According to Affymetrix protocol using recommended instrumentation!Sample_scan_protocol = According to Affymetrix protocol and using GeneChip Operating Software!Sample_description = none!Sample_data_processing = primary data description: Partek's copy number workflow generates copy number ratios relative to matching normal samples or a pooled baseline and then converts and presents these values as whole copy numbers. The file titled SNP6_Normalised-Copy-number.csv contains these values for each sample. In this file, probes on Chromosome Y and the Mitochondrion (MT) have been removed and the probesets are organised first by Chromosome and then by start position. Annotations for this were mapped in Partek using the Affymetrix GenomewideSNP6, CN and SNP annotation files, release number 23. This data was then used for Segmentation using the CBS algorithm in the DNAcopy package in R open-source software.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Manasa,,Ramakrishna!Sample_contact_email = manasa.ramakrishna@petermac.org!Sample_contact_institute = Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre!Sample_contact_address = St Andrew's Pl!Sample_contact_city = Melbourne!Sample_contact_state = Victoria!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 3002!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM492nnn/GSM492522/suppl/GSM492522_IC487N.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM492nnn/GSM492522/suppl/GSM492522_IC487T.CEL.gz!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSE58579!Sample_series_id = GSE19539!Sample_data_row_count = 1870003#ID_REF = #VALUE = ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUECN_473963	1.7813899517059CN_473964	1.7630800008774CN_473965	1.608579993248CN_477984	1.3219499588013CN_473981	2.2894899845123CN_473982	1.4476599693298CN_497980	1.9085299968719CN_497981	2.5448999404907CN_513369	1.0158100128174CN_513370	2.0667700767517CN_517762	1.507779955864CN_517763	1.3049700260162CN_502615	0.53008699417114CN_502613	1.5704400539398CN_502614	1.7871999740601CN_502616	2.3018100261688CN_502842	1.7928899526596CN_502843	1.928650021553CN_466171	1.3604799509048CN_466172	1.9148199558258!sample_table_end
