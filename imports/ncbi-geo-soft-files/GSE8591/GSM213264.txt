Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Ductal Carcinoma in situ Laser Captured Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213264/suppl/GSM213264.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8591!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Cy3 Mean#CH1_BK_MEAN = Cy3 Bkground#CH2_SIG_MEAN = Cy5 Mean#CH2_BK_MEAN = Cy5 Bkground!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANCTB-2327O11	-1.16254629797378	7344	1857	5677	1791RP11-396B3	-0.022046639083918906	1818	77	3741	439RP11-392B15	0.05201148593162763	1049	78	3299	548RP11-121D03	-0.14500978348769422	3352	91	5553	443RP11-236I04	0.16814510780501557	1518	80	3794	417RP11-362I3	0.47979825061585624	3282	99	10233	477RP11-321I5	-0.27864551303248253	3349	135	6192	507RP11-566G8	-0.8672645299341436	7203	1348	5662	1639RP11-1009O05	0.025662772410484536	2121	89	5222	516RP11-292J24	-0.575742585253403	4464	83	6012	443RP11-387B8	-0.006269322956076073	2447	83	4883	454RP11-395E17	0.3896026199109992	5769	89	11775	429RP11-114I18	-0.16418188437311476	3512	127	6410	492RP11-122D19	-0.18752572277194535	3036	81	6756	450RP11-465B24	-0.5391435066440635	2501	79	3621	428RP11-1014J07	-0.493312948253377	2529	529	3702	871RP11-352F8	-0.04406440068843964	1879	88	3837	433RP11-339B3	-0.12267113746374414	1879	79	4032	435RP11-513C18	0.0196448493066419	160	105	675	456RP11-1020M16	-0.14244920735853184	3435	89	6169	431!sample_table_end
