Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DCIS Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213282/suppl/GSM213282.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8591!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = cy3 mean#CH1_BK_MEAN = cy3 bk#CH2_SIG_MEAN = cy5 mean#CH2_BK_MEAN = cy5 bk!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANRP11-396B3	-0.2596705572281054	486	94	408	223CTB-2327O11	-0.07718379168632833	358	94	381	214RP11-392B15	-0.8026532505097344	1611	136	531	246RP11-121D03	0.18585961595266343	1399	182	933	277RP11-236I04	0.09516712963479346	339	150	392	255RP11-362I3	1.2312843293757965	2140	86	3254	242RP11-321I5	-0.5139784284406472	1576	158	662	232RP11-566G8	-0.9475089519680806	6682	147	3585	228RP11-1009O05	0.38504157148279816	2056	167	1520	233RP11-292J24	-0.48421772069482283	6753	93	3245	228RP11-387B8	0.4816364849015574	1249	119	1128	230RP11-395E17	0.7689288642291557	1856	188	1652	230RP11-114I18	-0.0145218131808027	4967	135	2524	239RP11-122D19	-0.1920885326866579	857	93	536	216RP11-465B24	0.26035841308153745	945	101	730	226RP11-1014J07	-0.284652072467135	1264	92	738	236RP11-352F8	-0.1459161253132384	342	108	394	216RP11-339B3	-0.1359079868226023	1082	83	775	248RP11-513C18	0.20631418723192585	1982	143	1195	243RP11-1020M16	0.2121879449494405	1069	132	1010	232!sample_table_end
