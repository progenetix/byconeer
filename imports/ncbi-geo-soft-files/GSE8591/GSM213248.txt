Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Ductal Carcinoma in situ Laser Captured Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labelled.!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213248/suppl/GSM213248.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8591!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Cy3 Signal#CH1_BK_MEAN = Cy3 Background#CH2_SIG_MEAN = Cy5 Signal#CH2_BK_MEAN = Cy5 Background!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANCTB-2327O11	0.0926792388878167	1449	108	2039	285RP11-396B3	0.2672882325480904	2249	127	3385	306RP11-392B15	-0.3424604567213645	4186	188	4237	354RP11-121D03	0.0014299115113100003	3716	158	4154	337RP11-236I04	-0.3542637287961434	1379	105	1854	303RP11-362I3	0.3677608153336539	2018	96	3571	280RP11-321I5	-0.17526856675165997	2297	114	2863	310RP11-566G8	-0.7222190824136695	3080	123	2416	305RP11-1009O05	0.007368202738772811	3035	118	3764	298RP11-292J24	-0.3945131742496164	5921	142	5321	312RP11-387B8	0.5447904139419406	2524	141	4241	309RP11-395E17	0.34416659756800394	2610	101	3761	295RP11-114I18	0.06760624984847652	5318	102	6502	301RP11-122D19	-0.14630732293195803	4889	163	5358	340RP11-465B24	-0.5384208046609269	2645	115	2116	292RP11-1014J07	-0.416522344546456	3523	136	3118	309RP11-352F8	-0.2086475405761567	2039	142	2544	315RP11-339B3	-0.5613238017962543	2705	129	2498	327RP11-513C18	0.04893975164808806	257	143	546	334RP11-1020M16	-0.4092260810855568	3994	106	3681	297!sample_table_end
