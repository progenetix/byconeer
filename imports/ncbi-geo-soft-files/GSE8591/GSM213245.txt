Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Ductal Carcinoma in situ Laser Captured Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labelled.!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213245/suppl/GSM213245.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8591!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Cy3 Signal#CH1_BK_MEAN = Cy3 Background#CH2_SIG_MEAN = Cy5 Signal#CH2_BK_MEAN = Cy5 Background!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANCTB-2327O11	0.12962560589318506	1803	89	951	239RP11-396B3	-0.14032409410653646	2458	74	1032	250RP11-392B15	-0.0512600530313847	5133	74	1758	241RP11-121D03	-0.1620623339046645	3048	110	946	262RP11-236I04	-0.08484714960089224	2373	80	1081	232RP11-362I3	0.5921854585829541	4910	74	2995	250RP11-321I5	0.11537720906213478	2394	95	1308	239RP11-566G8	-0.4950687555854418	925	94	519	259RP11-1009O05	0.8638316364883717	4894	77	4264	280RP11-292J24	-0.15072803337356655	5227	75	2101	254RP11-387B8	0.8098855609297979	1974	77	1413	236RP11-395E17	-0.0541744418600254	3321	79	1286	233RP11-114I18	-0.23028805769157445	12536	103	3791	247RP11-122D19	0.157049759674327	3186	75	1461	245RP11-465B24	-0.1511625558623355	2285	82	856	238RP11-1014J07	-0.5519488642490662	921	96	444	263RP11-352F8	-0.18253222992447005	2041	80	971	254RP11-339B3	0.07983077830836871	4175	76	1725	241RP11-513C18	0.37069809200568793	192	95	375	264RP11-1020M16	-0.794838426853888	5235	83	1241	243!sample_table_end
