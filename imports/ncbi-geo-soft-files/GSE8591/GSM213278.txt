Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DCIS Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213278/suppl/GSM213278.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8591!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Cy3 Mean#CH1_BK_MEAN = Cy3 bk#CH2_SIG_MEAN = cy5 mean#CH2_BK_MEAN = cy5 bk!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANRP11-396B3	-0.12214039821075601	523	82	646	238CTB-2327O11	0.42261037043336014	357	87	737	226RP11-392B15	-0.8321069914146876	925	86	537	255RP11-121D03	-0.38656939509584776	1716	112	1108	241RP11-236I04	0.1666342302435882	527	82	667	256RP11-362I3	0.3105162867274367	9451	96	2833	292RP11-321I5	0.3813958532127054	1896	116	2002	240RP11-566G8	-1.7288486096573967	5203	135	2198	240RP11-1009O05	-1.140954848902603	1835	108	665	231RP11-292J24	-1.3631768147123795	6339	134	1464	252RP11-387B8	-0.374870700804516	1414	114	633	242RP11-395E17	0.46819824825711986	1555	112	1350	229RP11-114I18	-0.6286604735492773	4145	93	1740	259RP11-122D19	-0.3431879526229903	2195	113	1052	263RP11-465B24	-0.3463328686129855	708	85	553	239RP11-1014J07	-1.519632054003591	2287	99	555	274RP11-352F8	-0.2013265042140306	634	102	765	237RP11-339B3	-0.12584933292512168	1700	93	1000	299RP11-513C18	0.3746049151253927	1678	98	1688	253RP11-1020M16	-0.3734191783652213	1437	82	956	239!sample_table_end
