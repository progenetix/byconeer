Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DCIS Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213280/suppl/GSM213280.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8591!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = cy3 mean#CH1_BK_MEAN = cy3 bk#CH2_SIG_MEAN = cy5 mean#CH2_BK_MEAN = cy5 bk!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANRP11-396B3	-0.3188648545171606	264	78	340	223CTB-2327O11	-0.3623877528740033	257	84	310	215RP11-392B15	-0.63213661888964	636	81	337	239RP11-121D03	0.6913064230808371	689	98	764	220RP11-236I04	-0.0365198330411945	477	89	401	247RP11-362I3	1.073033709785074	3526	80	4309	265RP11-321I5	-0.12462294481062447	720	101	544	219RP11-566G8	-0.04289379476600952	3606	117	2126	229RP11-1009O05	-0.5261372763704957	918	90	424	218RP11-292J24	-1.0343931347090887	9676	94	2253	243RP11-387B8	0.1769859779012255	1460	115	885	232RP11-395E17	0.7862044731257132	905	117	1068	229RP11-114I18	-0.37924460570847596	1753	78	668	242RP11-122D19	-0.07202425690996755	1146	87	652	231RP11-465B24	-0.07398076161439851	337	74	357	236RP11-1014J07	-1.162928795576302	1585	84	454	248RP11-352F8	-0.02872687889956327	260	86	354	219RP11-339B3	-0.5970629582519381	1270	96	843	274RP11-513C18	0.3778625734356147	1310	95	945	244RP11-1020M16	-0.260104557743077	754	79	553	227!sample_table_end
