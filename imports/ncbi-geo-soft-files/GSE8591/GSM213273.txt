Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DCIS Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213273/suppl/GSM213273.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8591!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Cy3 Mean#CH1_BK_MEAN = Cy3 Bk#CH2_SIG_MEAN = Cy5 Mean#CH2_BK_MEAN = Cy5 Bk!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANRP11-396B3	0.41722202108211437	1114	83	1754	271CTB-2327O11	2.1854985702894556	1103	85	5406	261RP11-392B15	-0.24197280938556848	875	95	830	279RP11-121D03	0.6041847012466165	3968	197	4841	309RP11-236I04	-0.6991110774090188	981	94	738	274RP11-362I3	0.324137428782585	6322	89	6648	270RP11-321I5	0.627077498647792	4475	145	5300	303RP11-566G8	-0.3895046558208458	14052	146	9515	256RP11-1009O05	-0.15108669032113847	4191	131	3266	256RP11-292J24	-0.12858758326674274	17213	108	15591	251RP11-387B8	-0.3496085461976458	3112	122	2276	250RP11-395E17	-0.4001089453955986	4081	100	3321	243RP11-114I18	-0.10999640240100017	7874	105	6737	272RP11-122D19	-0.09445130493997994	3652	175	2903	296RP11-465B24	-0.09083957054903063	2433	89	2054	255RP11-1014J07	-0.1656701808876529	6458	276	5503	272RP11-352F8	0.3144921483657751	1615	109	2235	292RP11-339B3	-0.2755021889727813	2262	87	2020	259RP11-513C18	0.31380643008477904	2603	101	2762	270RP11-1020M16	0.06029212050427485	3006	142	2662	354!sample_table_end
