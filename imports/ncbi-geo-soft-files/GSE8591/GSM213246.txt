Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Ductal Carcinoma in situ Laser Captured Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labelled.!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213246/suppl/GSM213246.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8591!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Cy3 Signal Mean#CH1_BK_MEAN = Cy3 Background#CH2_SIG_MEAN = Cy5 Signal Mean#CH2_BK_MEAN = Cy5 Background!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANCTB-2327O11	0.15247907692796314	1571	85	3930	305RP11-396B3	0.214812508399016	2916	87	8893	342RP11-392B15	-0.22806695559659607	3638	78	7478	290RP11-121D03	-0.17401741478438826	3800	107	7483	359RP11-236I04	-0.2605232155678263	1036	86	2469	318RP11-362I3	0.2033429557704458	4354	77	11067	255RP11-321I5	-0.24357697828125102	1728	98	3125	391RP11-566G8	-0.4805536277158332	2158	92	4605	321RP11-1009O05	0.16940138752290146	2673	86	8298	807RP11-292J24	-0.43077402210365934	6596	101	12293	391RP11-387B8	0.10993406373915637	1367	86	3253	315RP11-395E17	-0.22532204226308972	1687	85	3191	306RP11-114I18	-0.07798148594166321	2091	104	4574	372RP11-122D19	-0.20865060567381166	4129	125	7974	373RP11-465B24	-0.5666695621366211	3417	89	4970	310RP11-1014J07	-0.12075500772573888	2758	90	5399	327RP11-352F8	-0.11128118730482606	1846	88	4438	323RP11-339B3	-0.3432576638294522	3440	87	6104	337RP11-513C18	-0.12898255458575658	213	90	650	337RP11-1020M16	-0.34715679545230893	2664	95	4697	308!sample_table_end
