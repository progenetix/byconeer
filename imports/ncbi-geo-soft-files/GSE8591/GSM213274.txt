Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DCIS Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213274/suppl/GSM213274.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8591!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Cy3 Mean#CH1_BK_MEAN = Cy3 bk#CH2_SIG_MEAN = Cy5 mean#CH2_BK_MEAN = cy5 bk!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANRP11-396B3	0.6114399365120422	795	80	1704	257CTB-2327O11	2.051756876228274	1327	91	7963	326RP11-392B15	-0.3872634113776363	709	88	872	283RP11-121D03	0.0018933828232372898	3817	107	3976	247RP11-236I04	-0.456031663844261	617	246	709	412RP11-362I3	0.4063255283861147	6735	140	9348	334RP11-321I5	-0.3225381688099226	4897	111	5159	250RP11-566G8	-0.19443960269372157	8846	183	7901	318RP11-1009O05	-0.05083965280384639	4434	153	4211	295RP11-292J24	-0.05914280943247169	11811	200	12981	364RP11-387B8	-0.2523006307342407	2089	160	2125	285RP11-395E17	-0.21143819197224706	3895	167	4134	333RP11-114I18	0.0793051246338633	7613	85	8123	296RP11-122D19	-0.1724644398543309	5095	254	4625	430RP11-465B24	-0.2177733323171939	1388	84	1442	270RP11-1014J07	-0.10074948035456727	3757	138	4445	285RP11-352F8	0.4081327628392667	2457	88	3871	254RP11-339B3	-0.32924266300345817	3932	86	4077	254RP11-513C18	0.0352077972815627	2735	93	3019	275RP11-1020M16	0.1461921964816979	2692	97	3129	285!sample_table_end
