Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Ductal Carcinoma in situ Laser Captured Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213268/suppl/GSM213268.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8591!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Cy3 Mean#CH1_BK_MEAN = Cy3 Bkground#CH2_SIG_MEAN = Cy5 Mean#CH2_BK_MEAN = Cy5 Bkground!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANCTB-2327O11	0.2964663492275836	1864	122	1928	340RP11-396B3	0.1961052883969406	2851	117	3058	378RP11-392B15	-0.21052245425930863	3075	127	2643	363RP11-121D03	-0.2583456689003695	5955	195	3399	358RP11-236I04	0.12211894145239913	1888	125	2166	345RP11-362I3	0.9986260554340736	4925	138	8774	432RP11-321I5	0.8992721028063416	4982	175	7570	374RP11-566G8	-0.192361300511442	6092	120	3656	344RP11-1009O05	-0.10439747205841604	2385	73	2416	357RP11-292J24	-0.6797758688291066	6786	89	3558	359RP11-387B8	0.15915542032667543	3507	101	2859	339RP11-395E17	0.5168435861863172	7719	133	6671	365RP11-114I18	-0.36306643258715254	5389	165	3210	362RP11-122D19	-0.4098442141177284	6988	96	4266	359RP11-465B24	-0.7950813186097914	4649	138	2196	350RP11-1014J07	-0.02301902698095734	2816	131	2333	356RP11-352F8	0.22551384208683492	2731	124	3051	350RP11-339B3	-0.3272605124072414	2716	110	2220	356RP11-513C18	-0.12168126461185014	198	123	444	345RP11-1020M16	-0.4408087555001369	6225	129	3384	363!sample_table_end
