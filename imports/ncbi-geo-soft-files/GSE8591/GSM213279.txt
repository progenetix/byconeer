Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DCIS Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213279/suppl/GSM213279.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8591!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Cy3 mean#CH1_BK_MEAN = cy3 bk#CH2_SIG_MEAN = cy5 mean#CH2_BK_MEAN = cy5 bk!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANRP11-396B3	-0.3903117802074699	659	86	591	246CTB-2327O11	0.7765484210895016	435	79	836	240RP11-392B15	-0.7067433404167024	1238	80	550	280RP11-121D03	1.3347638160965694	1678	130	2201	238RP11-236I04	-0.2207970089022757	395	75	434	269RP11-362I3	0.3048776215834481	8558	95	1899	272RP11-321I5	-0.5389528936190183	1771	120	825	235RP11-566G8	-1.3475625676339371	5625	120	1321	238RP11-1009O05	-0.4778437648794178	1738	102	725	237RP11-292J24	-2.0591170952646376	9277	124	1034	261RP11-387B8	-0.3575658087409618	1181	166	552	252RP11-395E17	0.2774870452094709	1327	131	953	246RP11-114I18	-1.6856513754080997	8538	86	1093	264RP11-122D19	1.2421944132913272	1765	104	2218	261RP11-465B24	-0.35315396442989344	851	95	500	254RP11-1014J07	-1.3961593494402376	2341	99	519	310RP11-352F8	0.09891576646993372	467	75	674	239RP11-339B3	-0.21697296566517232	1457	99	688	289RP11-513C18	-0.6272760723708909	1335	94	719	263RP11-1020M16	-0.2357684924597232	1826	97	1077	284!sample_table_end
