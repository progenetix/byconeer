Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Ductal Carcinoma in situ Laser Captured Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labelled.!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213249/suppl/GSM213249.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8591!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Cy3 Signal#CH1_BK_MEAN = Cy3 Background#CH2_SIG_MEAN = Cy5 Signal#CH2_BK_MEAN = Cy5 Background!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANCTB-2327O11	0.1896334772250944	1130	78	1161	254RP11-396B3	0.042801625347071326	1681	77	1433	250RP11-392B15	-0.1939037798475025	5066	78	3092	262RP11-121D03	-0.32989653302435384	1932	124	1163	282RP11-236I04	0.4069476975104102	1680	88	1810	257RP11-362I3	0.7078769383977794	2916	237	3701	418RP11-321I5	0.5381357060243166	2005	86	2327	295RP11-566G8	0.04586156891095289	2273	80	2341	256RP11-1009O05	0.07200184281879418	3279	69	2913	248RP11-292J24	-0.755152002487923	6535	74	2708	252RP11-387B8	0.5374884691949376	2055	79	2010	248RP11-395E17	0.8693328362161061	2643	81	3461	265RP11-114I18	-0.6188584358042108	5834	93	2743	261RP11-122D19	0.24635750728090894	4036	127	3309	285RP11-465B24	-0.5395075960464437	1110	222	661	457RP11-1014J07	-0.9243645771599978	2592	86	1057	258RP11-352F8	0.018964673980830973	1304	92	1236	288RP11-339B3	0.007844639368742023	2839	80	2076	256RP11-513C18	-0.31448654943024335	192	90	327	266RP11-1020M16	-0.22941638622495752	2401	76	1617	253!sample_table_end
