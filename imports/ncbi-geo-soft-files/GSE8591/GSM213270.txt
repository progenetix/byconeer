Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DCIS Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213270/suppl/GSM213270.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8591!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Cy3 Mean#CH1_BK_MEAN = Cy3 Bkground#CH2_SIG_MEAN = Cy5 Mean#CH2_BK_MEAN = Cy5 Bkground!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANRP11-396B3	0.2897763810588955	915	73	835	269CTB-2327O11	1.0833221468150867	658	77	1056	263RP11-392B15	-1.1936015550730577	2531	104	589	301RP11-121D03	-0.28492695321145356	5405	121	1996	249RP11-236I04	-0.15770407711856532	716	90	521	297RP11-362I3	0.37298649305620346	8836	86	4228	246RP11-321I5	0.29591255763923296	5386	134	2962	245RP11-566G8	-0.6882048461894579	16563	164	3940	252RP11-1009O05	-0.44549936545235136	6352	123	1821	261RP11-292J24	-0.38659534190664746	21305	119	6475	251RP11-387B8	-0.641369006265182	4634	136	1349	238RP11-395E17	0.856802541574148	1774	105	1450	246RP11-114I18	-0.29672295219718414	8758	81	2348	303RP11-122D19	0.09880860856546336	7872	110	2617	244RP11-465B24	-0.6034437254758953	1282	81	557	292RP11-1014J07	-1.8231670289493336	6465	126	628	243RP11-352F8	-0.6830518139259876	1390	101	589	279RP11-339B3	0.29819903816446125	2529	86	1127	239RP11-513C18	1.3216139036812342	6088	122	4325	322RP11-1020M16	-0.18230729725364458	4181	93	1614	287!sample_table_end
