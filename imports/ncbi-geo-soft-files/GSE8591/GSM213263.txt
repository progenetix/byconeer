Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Ductal Carcinoma in situ Laser Captured Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213263/suppl/GSM213263.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8591!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Cy3 Signal#CH1_BK_MEAN = Cy3 Background#CH2_SIG_MEAN = Cy5 Signal#CH2_BK_MEAN = Cy5 Background!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANCTB-2327O11	0.21242725750973157	1207	94	2052	399RP11-396B3	0.014156836090479352	1467	109	2462	454RP11-392B15	-0.1599517565976642	3640	96	4665	422RP11-121D03	-0.3960141833449273	4087	99	3831	410RP11-236I04	-0.055383702097886456	2029	93	2786	402RP11-362I3	0.2961062934421165	4298	193	8543	620RP11-321I5	-0.3335548131172141	4582	102	4864	451RP11-566G8	-0.9415949114949059	3127	1381	2318	1225RP11-1009O05	0.1215640820224877	2691	114	4534	457RP11-292J24	-0.30798803438850775	4943	90	5505	414RP11-387B8	0.04889939008081312	2661	113	3480	405RP11-395E17	0.08872576433001039	7297	177	8165	499RP11-114I18	-0.2601870201892992	5957	96	6013	441RP11-122D19	-0.20819990786945078	5269	138	6320	472RP11-465B24	-0.44260794808628745	2955	153	3008	441RP11-1014J07	-0.35124729853314657	1960	367	2055	581RP11-352F8	-0.12137281726344851	1050	564	1791	807RP11-339B3	-0.2579713981659634	2565	91	3225	417RP11-513C18	0.0628042602714789	140	90	513	386RP11-1020M16	-0.36489966737143964	4656	102	4398	433!sample_table_end
