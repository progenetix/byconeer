Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DCIS Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213276/suppl/GSM213276.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8591!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Cy3 Mean#CH1_BK_MEAN = Cy3 Bk#CH2_SIG_MEAN = Cy5 mean#CH2_BK_MEAN = cy5 bk!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANRP11-396B3	0.06444232559652097	382	78	1296	252CTB-2327O11	0.27127502533679193	532	90	2492	247RP11-392B15	-1.2108453005077768	1164	76	1867	291RP11-121D03	0.2717923989511353	2080	125	9259	294RP11-236I04	-0.23589413920096747	510	81	1480	287RP11-362I3	-0.6272680050131463	10965	131	14488	360RP11-321I5	-0.11313766927967461	2163	128	7501	293RP11-566G8	-1.0709362914870706	4043	117	6009	298RP11-1009O05	-0.842273706298135	2170	108	4902	260RP11-292J24	-0.6401319406715407	10951	111	18766	322RP11-387B8	-1.201487279973499	1861	115	3277	311RP11-395E17	0.21634505232671053	2551	110	8057	270RP11-114I18	0.05486532611589423	8944	78	20878	277RP11-122D19	0.42398592907796573	2443	113	9129	315RP11-465B24	0.26256464618378583	684	86	2787	280RP11-1014J07	-1.3380254951676624	3226	106	4123	335RP11-352F8	-0.36717414603669796	1121	84	2999	242RP11-339B3	-0.24019290062862564	760	98	2263	389RP11-513C18	0.24114440930337366	1151	96	3482	291RP11-1020M16	0.450406724193291	1315	88	5106	271!sample_table_end
