Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Ductal Carcinoma in situ Laser Captured Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213261/suppl/GSM213261.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8591!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Cy3 Signal#CH1_BK_MEAN = Cy3 Background#CH2_SIG_MEAN = Cy5 Signal#CH2_BK_MEAN = Cy5 Background!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANCTB-2327O11	0.18746789362476735	1333	95	1699	340RP11-396B3	0.3291912860149816	2378	90	3605	364RP11-392B15	-0.3901157575717572	4673	91	3099	345RP11-121D03	-0.28591838585874696	3443	127	2700	363RP11-236I04	0.014035512159239621	1989	90	2191	345RP11-362I3	0.7984799111363434	4834	89	7410	382RP11-321I5	0.0903057214462818	2445	105	2667	396RP11-566G8	-0.7203725780741205	2093	93	1902	322RP11-1009O05	0.7046935441770357	3524	78	7411	440RP11-292J24	-0.8231209480755161	5178	89	3261	348RP11-387B8	-0.29379298707934	2776	91	2154	334RP11-395E17	0.3716772897062749	3195	89	3830	343RP11-114I18	-0.42324072301784893	6196	89	4152	378RP11-122D19	-0.5098076011482133	4901	86	3317	362RP11-465B24	-0.726410380999316	1698	95	1192	354RP11-1014J07	-0.8698722279517348	3007	93	1665	344RP11-352F8	0.5100273664459621	1609	88	2677	320RP11-339B3	-0.10872493433207828	3363	104	3174	350RP11-513C18	-0.3865622897452252	211	103	426	335RP11-1020M16	-0.5018834545248816	3035	84	2248	349!sample_table_end
