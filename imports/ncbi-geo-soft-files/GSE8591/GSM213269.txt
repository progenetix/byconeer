Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Ductal Carcinoma in situ Laser Captured Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213269/suppl/GSM213269.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8591!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Cy3 Mean#CH1_BK_MEAN = Cy3 Bkground#CH2_SIG_MEAN = Cy5 Mean#CH2_BK_MEAN = Cy5 Bkground!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANCTB-2327O11	0.054030882054621976	1620	113	1998	353RP11-396B3	-0.10814788469507274	2964	87	3122	359RP11-392B15	-0.21475351825688682	2465	95	3003	366RP11-121D03	-0.20544234977965997	5286	111	4265	349RP11-236I04	-0.12070179173538587	1679	195	2215	412RP11-362I3	0.33713831702773134	4974	147	9344	455RP11-321I5	0.3962002486570759	4645	150	7318	362RP11-566G8	-0.3324703580945665	6956	149	5427	397RP11-1009O05	-0.34397119430980155	3429	82	3535	398RP11-292J24	-0.011141548915539506	7642	109	8539	425RP11-387B8	0.1106493560098431	2978	125	3572	374RP11-395E17	0.16826032253390613	7619	158	8510	399RP11-114I18	-0.1761998319673222	5017	180	5189	384RP11-122D19	0.08386185091607601	5187	117	7603	429RP11-465B24	-0.44909876334166654	4094	117	3329	378RP11-1014J07	-0.5422827372142733	1998	150	1691	406RP11-352F8	-0.39237288647614965	3129	159	2874	465RP11-339B3	-0.42343853778085594	2024	109	2289	351RP11-513C18	-0.21311203552059887	233	131	474	356RP11-1020M16	-0.48225191368390474	5421	131	4778	361!sample_table_end
