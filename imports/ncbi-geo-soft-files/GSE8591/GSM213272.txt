Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = DCIS Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213272/suppl/GSM213272.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8591!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Cy3 Mean#CH1_BK_MEAN = Cy3 Bk#CH2_SIG_MEAN = Cy5 Mean#CH2_BK_MEAN = Cy5 Bk!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANRP11-396B3	-0.08123251624810068	255	70	375	272CTB-2327O11	0.9945791614271465	511	75	853	245RP11-392B15	-1.3212880867746546	1648	90	455	281RP11-121D03	-0.10798461387540814	4333	130	1783	258RP11-236I04	-0.05013151486384376	657	84	573	296RP11-362I3	0.8820414719461998	10324	85	6920	265RP11-321I5	0.16517275994874336	3907	172	1891	256RP11-566G8	-0.09127765461921711	17140	177	4790	265RP11-1009O05	-0.19935224957228992	4091	131	1286	268RP11-292J24	-0.34318481740923246	16041	115	4350	258RP11-387B8	-0.9012019239634279	2659	145	777	262RP11-395E17	-0.07640290715709286	7056	111	3305	248RP11-114I18	0.022755967841189273	10091	81	5023	292RP11-122D19	-0.4365982885797217	6112	129	1578	255RP11-465B24	-0.5914827073688971	1208	82	518	277RP11-1014J07	-1.7737596536939795	7476	104	769	265RP11-352F8	-0.34830249877021346	1290	79	549	239RP11-339B3	0.7092046426829092	534	90	764	267RP11-513C18	1.5380918857214112	3501	100	3831	297RP11-1020M16	-0.15730508451972713	2647	84	1214	281!sample_table_end
