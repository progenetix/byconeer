Aliquots of labeled target and reference DNA were cohybridized to each BAC microarray with 100 Î¼g of human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com) to block repetitive sequences.!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Commercial human DNA obtained from female genomic DNA. A pool was used to reduce variation between arrays.!Sample_label_ch1 = Cy3!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labelled!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Ductal Carcinoma in situ Laser Captured Cells!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = A skilled histotechnologist cut and mounted single 10-Î¼m thick paraffin sections of each target tissue onto PET-membrane slides used with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries, http://www.molecular-machines.com). We deparaffinized, rehydrated and stained the sections with hematoxylin. Within 1â2 h, we placed each section into a microdissection unit that sandwiches the tissue section between a clean glass slide and the membrane and microdissected it with the SL Î¼CUT System (Molecular Machines & Industries). !Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Extracted cells were digested with proteinase K and DOP amplified and labeled.!Sample_label_ch2 = cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Indirect DOP PCR amplified amina-allyl dUTP labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = The arrays, in Corning Hybridization chambers were incubated at 37 Â°C for 72 h, then washed, dried, and scanned.!Sample_scan_protocol = The slides were scanned with the GenePix Microarrray Scanner (Axon Instruments, http://www.moleculardevices.com). Data was extracted using the GenePix Pro Software package.!Sample_description = We examined a set of human breast cancers that were laser-microdissected from archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. These samples represent an important resource; however, they also represent a challenging aCGH application, as they tend to have significant amounts of noise. !Sample_data_processing = We observed an intensity dependent bias and performed print tipâspecific loess normalization within each array.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5672!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Guttman!Sample_contact_email = mguttman@mit.edu!Sample_contact_institute = Broad Institute!Sample_contact_address = 7 Cambridge Center!Sample_contact_city = Cambridge!Sample_contact_state = MA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 02139!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM213nnn/GSM213265/suppl/GSM213265.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE8591!Sample_series_id = GSE8601!Sample_data_row_count = 4995#ID_REF = #VALUE = Loess-normalized log2 (test/reference) ratio#CH1_SIG_MEAN = Cy3 Mean#CH1_BK_MEAN = Cy3 Bkground#CH2_SIG_MEAN = Cy5 Mean#CH2_BK_MEAN = Cy5 Bkground!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	CH1_SIG_MEAN	CH1_BK_MEAN	CH2_SIG_MEAN	CH2_BK_MEANCTB-2327O11	0.15711118591093265	867	84	2898	386RP11-396B3	-0.06935784527138167	1889	85	5899	430RP11-392B15	-0.23157658027862693	1772	82	5422	463RP11-121D03	-0.2687061358262657	4391	114	9574	481RP11-236I04	-0.14790297125512564	1356	77	4382	394RP11-362I3	0.143944950739606	781	118	3576	832RP11-321I5	-0.0035830270573165013	2902	100	9134	496RP11-566G8	-0.19605559686605045	3585	92	8718	402RP11-1009O05	-0.021531343399103342	582	86	2779	795RP11-292J24	-0.19350467187889198	4412	110	12057	480RP11-387B8	0.2765548327426268	1804	80	6490	383RP11-395E17	0.0644381610513558	5115	80	14554	403RP11-114I18	0.29027047465537814	3515	113	13001	522RP11-122D19	-0.2341006141780375	3580	76	9684	414RP11-465B24	-0.10121186470289611	1555	80	4205	391RP11-1014J07	-0.22308679252327845	1986	81	5188	387RP11-352F8	-0.1350771808579334	2629	78	6258	425RP11-339B3	-0.2502452737690848	1609	78	4667	399RP11-513C18	-0.12054659378548704	189	179	709	693RP11-1020M16	-0.29909374669687017	3174	129	7259	505!sample_table_end
