The concentration and the quality of the DNA were determined using  NanoDrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Amplification and labeling were performed according to the protocol supplied by the Affymetrix for  SNP 6.0 arrays. 500 ng of gDNA was digested with NspI and StyI restriction enzymes, ligated to respectively NspI and StyI adaptors, amplified by PCR using a single primer. PCR products were purified and the amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 40-70 Âµg of purified amplicons were fragmented and biotin end-labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = Biotin-labeled fragments were hybridized to a Genechip Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays at 50Â°C for 16-18 hours in a GeneChipÂ® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerthrin was performed in a GeneChipÂ® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Inc.).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc.) and raw data processing was performed using the  âGeneChip Operating Softwareâ.!Sample_description = AML19Dx exp8!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was performed by the software "Genotyping Console v3.0.1 ". The following algorithms were used: 1) SNP 6.0 Birdseed v2 algorithm for genotyping, 2) BRLMM-P-Plus algorithm and Hidden Markov Model with regional GC correction for copy number analysis, 3) the LOH algorithm (CN5).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vincenza,,Barresi!Sample_contact_email = barregi@unict.it!Sample_contact_institute = University of Catania!Sample_contact_address = V.le A Doria, 6!Sample_contact_city = Catania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 95125!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542620/suppl/GSM542620.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542620/suppl/GSM542620_AML19Dx_exp8.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542620/suppl/GSM542620_AML19Dx_exp8_BRLMM-P-Plus.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21780!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Birdseed genotype call#Signal A = #Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Signal A	Signal BSNP_A-2131660	AB	1.865.347	1.908.469SNP_A-1967418	AB	693.429	574.299SNP_A-1969580	BB	1.181.054	4.768.345SNP_A-4263484	AB	1.964.551	1.578.725SNP_A-1978185	AA	2.353.519	297.458SNP_A-4264431	AB	1.373.238	1.094.326SNP_A-1980898	AA	1.297.271	238.809SNP_A-1983139	AA	2.648.910	521.982SNP_A-4265735	AA	1.148.057	355.350SNP_A-1995832	BB	527.222	1.198.246SNP_A-1995893	BB	429.991	2.687.682SNP_A-1997689	BB	682.650	4.784.118SNP_A-1997709	AA	1.420.280	243.693SNP_A-1997896	AB	927.614	1.827.543SNP_A-1997922	AB	742.863	628.884SNP_A-2000230	AA	3.586.595	1.387.105SNP_A-2000332	AB	2.385.471	3.250.314SNP_A-2000337	AA	1.704.426	254.946SNP_A-2000342	AA	5.497.788	981.810SNP_A-4268173	AA	1.731.657	238.846!sample_table_end
