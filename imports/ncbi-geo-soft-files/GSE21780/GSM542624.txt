The concentration and the quality of the DNA were determined using  NanoDrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Amplification and labeling were performed according to the protocol supplied by the Affymetrix for  SNP 6.0 arrays. 500 ng of gDNA was digested with NspI and StyI restriction enzymes, ligated to respectively NspI and StyI adaptors, amplified by PCR using a single primer. PCR products were purified and the amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 40-70 Âµg of purified amplicons were fragmented and biotin end-labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = Biotin-labeled fragments were hybridized to a Genechip Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays at 50Â°C for 16-18 hours in a GeneChipÂ® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerthrin was performed in a GeneChipÂ® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Inc.).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc.) and raw data processing was performed using the  âGeneChip Operating Softwareâ.!Sample_description = AML23Dx exp8!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was performed by the software "Genotyping Console v3.0.1 ". The following algorithms were used: 1) SNP 6.0 Birdseed v2 algorithm for genotyping, 2) BRLMM-P-Plus algorithm and Hidden Markov Model with regional GC correction for copy number analysis, 3) the LOH algorithm (CN5).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vincenza,,Barresi!Sample_contact_email = barregi@unict.it!Sample_contact_institute = University of Catania!Sample_contact_address = V.le A Doria, 6!Sample_contact_city = Catania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 95125!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542624/suppl/GSM542624.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542624/suppl/GSM542624_AML23Dx_exp8.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542624/suppl/GSM542624_AML23Dx_exp8_BRLMM-P-Plus.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21780!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Birdseed genotype call#Signal A = #Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Signal A	Signal BSNP_A-2131660	BB	734.097	3.347.818SNP_A-1967418	BB	241.998	850.029SNP_A-1969580	BB	957.798	3.321.534SNP_A-4263484	BB	549.092	2.161.354SNP_A-1978185	AA	1.593.935	331.308SNP_A-4264431	AB	1.265.160	974.311SNP_A-1980898	BB	209.018	899.684SNP_A-1983139	AA	2.193.449	652.469SNP_A-4265735	AA	1.665.241	376.861SNP_A-1995832	AB	1.069.618	722.115SNP_A-1995893	AB	1.632.007	1.800.925SNP_A-1997689	BB	702.337	5.005.210SNP_A-1997709	AA	1.758.912	282.316SNP_A-1997896	AA	1.337.407	583.114SNP_A-1997922	AB	838.147	837.215SNP_A-2000230	AA	2.694.961	1.278.366SNP_A-2000332	BB	1.476.956	4.205.104SNP_A-2000337	AA	1.337.362	300.741SNP_A-2000342	AA	4.391.055	899.684SNP_A-4268173	AA	1.754.782	329.671!sample_table_end
