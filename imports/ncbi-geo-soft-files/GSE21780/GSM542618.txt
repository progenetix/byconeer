The concentration and the quality of the DNA were determined using  NanoDrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Amplification and labeling were performed according to the protocol supplied by the Affymetrix for  SNP 6.0 arrays. 500 ng of gDNA was digested with NspI and StyI restriction enzymes, ligated to respectively NspI and StyI adaptors, amplified by PCR using a single primer. PCR products were purified and the amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 40-70 Âµg of purified amplicons were fragmented and biotin end-labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = Biotin-labeled fragments were hybridized to a Genechip Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays at 50Â°C for 16-18 hours in a GeneChipÂ® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerthrin was performed in a GeneChipÂ® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Inc.).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc.) and raw data processing was performed using the  âGeneChip Operating Softwareâ.!Sample_description = AML17Dx exp7!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was performed by the software "Genotyping Console v3.0.1 ". The following algorithms were used: 1) SNP 6.0 Birdseed v2 algorithm for genotyping, 2) BRLMM-P-Plus algorithm and Hidden Markov Model with regional GC correction for copy number analysis, 3) the LOH algorithm (CN5).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vincenza,,Barresi!Sample_contact_email = barregi@unict.it!Sample_contact_institute = University of Catania!Sample_contact_address = V.le A Doria, 6!Sample_contact_city = Catania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 95125!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542618/suppl/GSM542618.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542618/suppl/GSM542618_AML17Dx_exp7.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542618/suppl/GSM542618_AML17Dx_exp7_BRLMM-P-Plus.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21780!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Birdseed genotype call#Signal A = #Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Signal A	Signal BSNP_A-2131660	BB	779.036	5.046.380SNP_A-1967418	AB	1.048.406	776.914SNP_A-1969580	BB	912.111	3.448.385SNP_A-4263484	AB	1.821.300	1.317.294SNP_A-1978185	AA	3.088.512	444.667SNP_A-4264431	AA	1.972.419	320.318SNP_A-1980898	AB	638.884	549.859SNP_A-1983139	AA	1.318.159	514.980SNP_A-4265735	AA	2.503.376	479.802SNP_A-1995832	AB	1.412.694	862.127SNP_A-1995893	AB	1.693.939	1.831.924SNP_A-1997689	BB	725.315	4.592.773SNP_A-1997709	AA	1.749.218	293.051SNP_A-1997896	AA	1.313.813	445.970SNP_A-1997922	AB	965.337	893.522SNP_A-2000230	AA	3.982.318	1.609.695SNP_A-2000332	AB	3.009.898	3.018.133SNP_A-2000337	AA	1.628.626	267.045SNP_A-2000342	AA	5.124.617	1.440.444SNP_A-4268173	AA	2.756.510	372.051!sample_table_end
