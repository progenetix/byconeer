The concentration and the quality of the DNA were determined using  NanoDrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Amplification and labeling were performed according to the protocol supplied by the Affymetrix for  SNP 6.0 arrays. 500 ng of gDNA was digested with NspI and StyI restriction enzymes, ligated to respectively NspI and StyI adaptors, amplified by PCR using a single primer. PCR products were purified and the amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 40-70 Âµg of purified amplicons were fragmented and biotin end-labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = Biotin-labeled fragments were hybridized to a Genechip Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays at 50Â°C for 16-18 hours in a GeneChipÂ® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerthrin was performed in a GeneChipÂ® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Inc.).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc.) and raw data processing was performed using the  âGeneChip Operating Softwareâ.!Sample_description = AML53Dx exp12!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was performed by the software "Genotyping Console v3.0.1 ". The following algorithms were used: 1) SNP 6.0 Birdseed v2 algorithm for genotyping, 2) BRLMM-P-Plus algorithm and Hidden Markov Model with regional GC correction for copy number analysis, 3) the LOH algorithm (CN5).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vincenza,,Barresi!Sample_contact_email = barregi@unict.it!Sample_contact_institute = University of Catania!Sample_contact_address = V.le A Doria, 6!Sample_contact_city = Catania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 95125!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542639/suppl/GSM542639.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542639/suppl/GSM542639_AML53Dx_exp12.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542639/suppl/GSM542639_AML53Dx_exp12_BRLMM-P-Plus.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21780!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Birdseed genotype call#Signal A = #Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Signal A	Signal BSNP_A-2131660	BB	669.387	5.170.562SNP_A-1967418	AA	1.201.046	224.624SNP_A-1969580	BB	1.604.947	6.449.980SNP_A-4263484	BB	553.772	1.700.778SNP_A-1978185	AA	1.467.429	271.334SNP_A-4264431	AA	1.906.813	246.177SNP_A-1980898	BB	276.554	977.766SNP_A-1983139	AA	1.483.096	508.816SNP_A-4265735	AA	2.557.536	371.771SNP_A-1995832	AA	2.502.635	345.674SNP_A-1995893	AA	4.026.530	1.241.000SNP_A-1997689	BB	509.688	4.153.847SNP_A-1997709	AA	1.548.370	314.790SNP_A-1997896	AA	1.563.829	501.337SNP_A-1997922	AA	930.639	250.568SNP_A-2000230	AA	3.508.493	840.780SNP_A-2000332	AA	4.609.428	785.807SNP_A-2000337	AA	1.809.474	216.196SNP_A-2000342	AA	5.376.428	1.265.920SNP_A-4268173	AA	2.631.615	342.274!sample_table_end
