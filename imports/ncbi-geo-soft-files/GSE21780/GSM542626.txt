The concentration and the quality of the DNA were determined using  NanoDrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Amplification and labeling were performed according to the protocol supplied by the Affymetrix for  SNP 6.0 arrays. 500 ng of gDNA was digested with NspI and StyI restriction enzymes, ligated to respectively NspI and StyI adaptors, amplified by PCR using a single primer. PCR products were purified and the amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 40-70 Âµg of purified amplicons were fragmented and biotin end-labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = Biotin-labeled fragments were hybridized to a Genechip Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays at 50Â°C for 16-18 hours in a GeneChipÂ® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerthrin was performed in a GeneChipÂ® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Inc.).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc.) and raw data processing was performed using the  âGeneChip Operating Softwareâ.!Sample_description = AML25Dx exp9!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was performed by the software "Genotyping Console v3.0.1 ". The following algorithms were used: 1) SNP 6.0 Birdseed v2 algorithm for genotyping, 2) BRLMM-P-Plus algorithm and Hidden Markov Model with regional GC correction for copy number analysis, 3) the LOH algorithm (CN5).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vincenza,,Barresi!Sample_contact_email = barregi@unict.it!Sample_contact_institute = University of Catania!Sample_contact_address = V.le A Doria, 6!Sample_contact_city = Catania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 95125!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542626/suppl/GSM542626.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542626/suppl/GSM542626_AML25Dx_exp9.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542626/suppl/GSM542626_AML25Dx_exp9_BRLMM-P-Plus.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21780!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Birdseed genotype call#Signal A = #Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Signal A	Signal BSNP_A-2131660	BB	515.843	3.463.333SNP_A-1967418	BB	259.171	982.441SNP_A-1969580	BB	938.474	4.027.416SNP_A-4263484	AB	1.871.350	1.290.608SNP_A-1978185	AA	1.924.683	470.616SNP_A-4264431	AB	1.316.280	1.005.499SNP_A-1980898	BB	221.318	962.937SNP_A-1983139	AA	2.548.673	793.231SNP_A-4265735	AB	900.398	953.562SNP_A-1995832	BB	296.045	1.214.935SNP_A-1995893	BB	386.338	2.687.840SNP_A-1997689	BB	683.493	4.686.854SNP_A-1997709	AA	1.395.843	335.304SNP_A-1997896	AA	1.797.570	468.441SNP_A-1997922	BB	431.032	1.187.461SNP_A-2000230	AA	3.946.350	1.149.340SNP_A-2000332	AB	3.127.920	3.617.463SNP_A-2000337	AA	1.322.147	230.750SNP_A-2000342	AA	6.035.800	920.086SNP_A-4268173	AA	3.369.943	319.030!sample_table_end
