The concentration and the quality of the DNA were determined using  NanoDrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Amplification and labeling were performed according to the protocol supplied by the Affymetrix for  SNP 6.0 arrays. 500 ng of gDNA was digested with NspI and StyI restriction enzymes, ligated to respectively NspI and StyI adaptors, amplified by PCR using a single primer. PCR products were purified and the amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 40-70 Âµg of purified amplicons were fragmented and biotin end-labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = Biotin-labeled fragments were hybridized to a Genechip Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays at 50Â°C for 16-18 hours in a GeneChipÂ® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerthrin was performed in a GeneChipÂ® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Inc.).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc.) and raw data processing was performed using the  âGeneChip Operating Softwareâ.!Sample_description = AML56R exp14!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was performed by the software "Genotyping Console v3.0.1 ". The following algorithms were used: 1) SNP 6.0 Birdseed v2 algorithm for genotyping, 2) BRLMM-P-Plus algorithm and Hidden Markov Model with regional GC correction for copy number analysis, 3) the LOH algorithm (CN5).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vincenza,,Barresi!Sample_contact_email = barregi@unict.it!Sample_contact_institute = University of Catania!Sample_contact_address = V.le A Doria, 6!Sample_contact_city = Catania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 95125!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542633/suppl/GSM542633.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542633/suppl/GSM542633_AML56R_exp14.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542633/suppl/GSM542633_AML56R_exp14_BRLMM-P-Plus.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21780!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Birdseed genotype call#Signal A = #Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Signal A	Signal BSNP_A-2131660	AB	2.044.145	2.298.546SNP_A-1967418	BB	266.154	1.197.340SNP_A-1969580	BB	1.398.024	5.830.871SNP_A-4263484	AB	1.773.130	1.301.816SNP_A-1978185	AA	1.165.871	290.860SNP_A-4264431	AA	3.800.844	446.159SNP_A-1980898	AB	1.019.556	1.041.504SNP_A-1983139	AA	3.133.651	812.456SNP_A-4265735	AA	1.666.998	474.381SNP_A-1995832	AB	1.259.003	960.925SNP_A-1995893	AB	1.803.132	1.719.007SNP_A-1997689	BB	557.191	3.783.859SNP_A-1997709	AA	1.217.973	266.154SNP_A-1997896	AA	2.025.686	475.407SNP_A-1997922	AB	839.349	629.534SNP_A-2000230	AA	3.473.009	1.060.530SNP_A-2000332	AA	3.275.728	586.903SNP_A-2000337	AA	1.634.185	293.325SNP_A-2000342	AA	4.429.346	937.255SNP_A-4268173	AB	1.351.656	1.070.707!sample_table_end
