The concentration and the quality of the DNA were determined using  NanoDrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Amplification and labeling were performed according to the protocol supplied by the Affymetrix for  SNP 6.0 arrays. 500 ng of gDNA was digested with NspI and StyI restriction enzymes, ligated to respectively NspI and StyI adaptors, amplified by PCR using a single primer. PCR products were purified and the amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 40-70 Âµg of purified amplicons were fragmented and biotin end-labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = Biotin-labeled fragments were hybridized to a Genechip Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays at 50Â°C for 16-18 hours in a GeneChipÂ® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerthrin was performed in a GeneChipÂ® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Inc.).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc.) and raw data processing was performed using the  âGeneChip Operating Softwareâ.!Sample_description = AML49Dx exp12!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was performed by the software "Genotyping Console v3.0.1 ". The following algorithms were used: 1) SNP 6.0 Birdseed v2 algorithm for genotyping, 2) BRLMM-P-Plus algorithm and Hidden Markov Model with regional GC correction for copy number analysis, 3) the LOH algorithm (CN5).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vincenza,,Barresi!Sample_contact_email = barregi@unict.it!Sample_contact_institute = University of Catania!Sample_contact_address = V.le A Doria, 6!Sample_contact_city = Catania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 95125!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542638/suppl/GSM542638.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542638/suppl/GSM542638_AML49Dx_exp12.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542638/suppl/GSM542638_AML49Dx_exp12_BRLMM-P-Plus.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21780!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Birdseed genotype call#Signal A = #Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Signal A	Signal BSNP_A-2131660	BB	876.703	2.906.519SNP_A-1967418	AB	519.954	634.101SNP_A-1969580	BB	781.145	5.602.578SNP_A-4263484	BB	625.923	2.116.583SNP_A-1978185	AA	1.650.004	376.153SNP_A-4264431	AB	1.549.752	1.190.617SNP_A-1980898	AB	937.443	409.239SNP_A-1983139	AA	1.967.354	404.096SNP_A-4265735	AB	1.171.483	1.228.238SNP_A-1995832	AB	1.577.338	1.075.928SNP_A-1995893	AB	1.955.954	2.041.228SNP_A-1997689	BB	699.270	3.969.995SNP_A-1997709	AA	1.408.769	319.531SNP_A-1997896	AA	1.300.666	485.273SNP_A-1997922	AB	353.671	356.175SNP_A-2000230	AA	3.435.631	1.313.208SNP_A-2000332	AA	3.849.602	825.934SNP_A-2000337	AA	1.994.959	292.159SNP_A-2000342	AA	4.783.344	764.707SNP_A-4268173	AA	1.886.716	278.117!sample_table_end
