The concentration and the quality of the DNA were determined using  NanoDrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Amplification and labeling were performed according to the protocol supplied by the Affymetrix for  SNP 6.0 arrays. 500 ng of gDNA was digested with NspI and StyI restriction enzymes, ligated to respectively NspI and StyI adaptors, amplified by PCR using a single primer. PCR products were purified and the amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 40-70 Âµg of purified amplicons were fragmented and biotin end-labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = Biotin-labeled fragments were hybridized to a Genechip Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays at 50Â°C for 16-18 hours in a GeneChipÂ® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerthrin was performed in a GeneChipÂ® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Inc.).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc.) and raw data processing was performed using the  âGeneChip Operating Softwareâ.!Sample_description = AML22R exp8!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was performed by the software "Genotyping Console v3.0.1 ". The following algorithms were used: 1) SNP 6.0 Birdseed v2 algorithm for genotyping, 2) BRLMM-P-Plus algorithm and Hidden Markov Model with regional GC correction for copy number analysis, 3) the LOH algorithm (CN5).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vincenza,,Barresi!Sample_contact_email = barregi@unict.it!Sample_contact_institute = University of Catania!Sample_contact_address = V.le A Doria, 6!Sample_contact_city = Catania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 95125!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542623/suppl/GSM542623.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542623/suppl/GSM542623_AML22R_exp8.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542623/suppl/GSM542623_AML22R_exp8_BRLMM-P-Plus.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21780!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Birdseed genotype call#Signal A = #Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Signal A	Signal BSNP_A-2131660	AB	2.246.068	2.331.716SNP_A-1967418	BB	244.009	724.947SNP_A-1969580	BB	1.095.231	4.098.701SNP_A-4263484	BB	729.242	2.771.192SNP_A-1978185	AA	1.449.984	330.999SNP_A-4264431	AA	2.119.557	316.187SNP_A-1980898	BB	209.490	844.519SNP_A-1983139	AA	2.241.802	634.028SNP_A-4265735	AA	1.479.765	329.259SNP_A-1995832	AB	1.032.968	780.728SNP_A-1995893	AB	1.769.988	1.866.849SNP_A-1997689	BB	677.343	4.857.921SNP_A-1997709	AA	2.034.070	296.429SNP_A-1997896	AA	1.775.579	471.118SNP_A-1997922	AB	1.041.951	704.263SNP_A-2000230	AA	3.390.325	1.308.817SNP_A-2000332	AA	3.522.123	768.727SNP_A-2000337	AA	1.432.129	231.118SNP_A-2000342	AA	4.803.358	1.292.300SNP_A-4268173	AA	2.087.956	359.065!sample_table_end
