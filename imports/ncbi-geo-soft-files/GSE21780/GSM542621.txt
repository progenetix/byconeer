The concentration and the quality of the DNA were determined using  NanoDrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Amplification and labeling were performed according to the protocol supplied by the Affymetrix for  SNP 6.0 arrays. 500 ng of gDNA was digested with NspI and StyI restriction enzymes, ligated to respectively NspI and StyI adaptors, amplified by PCR using a single primer. PCR products were purified and the amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 40-70 Âµg of purified amplicons were fragmented and biotin end-labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = Biotin-labeled fragments were hybridized to a Genechip Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays at 50Â°C for 16-18 hours in a GeneChipÂ® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerthrin was performed in a GeneChipÂ® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Inc.).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc.) and raw data processing was performed using the  âGeneChip Operating Softwareâ.!Sample_description = AML20R exp8!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was performed by the software "Genotyping Console v3.0.1 ". The following algorithms were used: 1) SNP 6.0 Birdseed v2 algorithm for genotyping, 2) BRLMM-P-Plus algorithm and Hidden Markov Model with regional GC correction for copy number analysis, 3) the LOH algorithm (CN5).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vincenza,,Barresi!Sample_contact_email = barregi@unict.it!Sample_contact_institute = University of Catania!Sample_contact_address = V.le A Doria, 6!Sample_contact_city = Catania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 95125!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542621/suppl/GSM542621.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542621/suppl/GSM542621_AML20R_exp8.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542621/suppl/GSM542621_AML20R_exp8_BRLMM-P-Plus.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21780!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Birdseed genotype call#Signal A = #Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Signal A	Signal BSNP_A-2131660	AB	2.742.916	2.171.000SNP_A-1967418	AB	595.072	530.773SNP_A-1969580	BB	902.295	4.601.687SNP_A-4263484	AB	2.022.696	1.550.817SNP_A-1978185	AA	1.734.900	290.319SNP_A-4264431	AB	1.295.578	1.122.043SNP_A-1980898	AA	1.007.624	235.978SNP_A-1983139	AA	2.135.959	620.313SNP_A-4265735	AA	1.296.974	323.970SNP_A-1995832	BB	453.388	1.232.555SNP_A-1995893	BB	386.062	2.260.820SNP_A-1997689	BB	667.532	5.113.227SNP_A-1997709	AA	1.542.851	239.631SNP_A-1997896	AB	1.196.915	1.888.317SNP_A-1997922	AB	898.255	759.888SNP_A-2000230	AA	4.126.583	1.325.130SNP_A-2000332	AB	2.724.560	2.979.116SNP_A-2000337	AA	1.527.123	217.785SNP_A-2000342	AA	5.720.783	1.111.616SNP_A-4268173	AA	1.738.617	298.824!sample_table_end
