The concentration and the quality of the DNA were determined using  NanoDrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Amplification and labeling were performed according to the protocol supplied by the Affymetrix for  SNP 6.0 arrays. 500 ng of gDNA was digested with NspI and StyI restriction enzymes, ligated to respectively NspI and StyI adaptors, amplified by PCR using a single primer. PCR products were purified and the amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 40-70 Âµg of purified amplicons were fragmented and biotin end-labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = Biotin-labeled fragments were hybridized to a Genechip Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays at 50Â°C for 16-18 hours in a GeneChipÂ® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerthrin was performed in a GeneChipÂ® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Inc.).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc.) and raw data processing was performed using the  âGeneChip Operating Softwareâ.!Sample_description = AML55DX exp 14!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was performed by the software "Genotyping Console v3.0.1 ". The following algorithms were used: 1) SNP 6.0 Birdseed v2 algorithm for genotyping, 2) BRLMM-P-Plus algorithm and Hidden Markov Model with regional GC correction for copy number analysis, 3) the LOH algorithm (CN5).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vincenza,,Barresi!Sample_contact_email = barregi@unict.it!Sample_contact_institute = University of Catania!Sample_contact_address = V.le A Doria, 6!Sample_contact_city = Catania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 95125!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542632/suppl/GSM542632.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542632/suppl/GSM542632_AML55Dx_exp14.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542632/suppl/GSM542632_AML55Dx_exp14_BRLMM-P-Plus.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21780!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Birdseed genotype call#Signal A = #Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Signal A	Signal BSNP_A-2131660	AB	2.644.011	2.779.261SNP_A-1967418	BB	286.201	911.905SNP_A-1969580	BB	1.201.057	5.164.208SNP_A-4263484	AB	1.814.973	1.254.540SNP_A-1978185	AA	1.570.405	359.085SNP_A-4264431	AA	3.003.074	357.829SNP_A-1980898	AB	898.053	729.508SNP_A-1983139	AA	3.366.597	748.918SNP_A-4265735	AA	1.810.839	386.228SNP_A-1995832	AB	1.112.272	916.677SNP_A-1995893	AB	1.901.554	2.239.859SNP_A-1997689	BB	567.115	3.357.202SNP_A-1997709	AA	1.745.758	268.370SNP_A-1997896	AA	1.841.584	472.253SNP_A-1997922	AB	833.962	829.997SNP_A-2000230	AA	3.085.561	948.999SNP_A-2000332	AA	3.424.307	508.803SNP_A-2000337	AA	1.356.973	178.539SNP_A-2000342	AA	5.051.931	877.890SNP_A-4268173	AB	1.029.637	922.839!sample_table_end
