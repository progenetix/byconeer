The concentration and the quality of the DNA were determined using  NanoDrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Amplification and labeling were performed according to the protocol supplied by the Affymetrix for  SNP 6.0 arrays. 500 ng of gDNA was digested with NspI and StyI restriction enzymes, ligated to respectively NspI and StyI adaptors, amplified by PCR using a single primer. PCR products were purified and the amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 40-70 Âµg of purified amplicons were fragmented and biotin end-labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = Biotin-labeled fragments were hybridized to a Genechip Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays at 50Â°C for 16-18 hours in a GeneChipÂ® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerthrin was performed in a GeneChipÂ® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Inc.).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc.) and raw data processing was performed using the  âGeneChip Operating Softwareâ.!Sample_description = AML61Dx exp14!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was performed by the software "Genotyping Console v3.0.1 ". The following algorithms were used: 1) SNP 6.0 Birdseed v2 algorithm for genotyping, 2) BRLMM-P-Plus algorithm and Hidden Markov Model with regional GC correction for copy number analysis, 3) the LOH algorithm (CN5).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vincenza,,Barresi!Sample_contact_email = barregi@unict.it!Sample_contact_institute = University of Catania!Sample_contact_address = V.le A Doria, 6!Sample_contact_city = Catania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 95125!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542634/suppl/GSM542634.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542634/suppl/GSM542634_AML61Dx_exp14.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542634/suppl/GSM542634_AML61Dx_exp14_BRLMM-P-Plus.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21780!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Birdseed genotype call#Signal A = #Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Signal A	Signal BSNP_A-2131660	BB	710.891	5.807.288SNP_A-1967418	AB	990.944	611.355SNP_A-1969580	BB	865.756	5.387.917SNP_A-4263484	BB	496.624	1.740.891SNP_A-1978185	AA	1.982.164	327.604SNP_A-4264431	AA	3.152.032	240.373SNP_A-1980898	BB	315.980	1.244.450SNP_A-1983139	AA	3.742.336	667.817SNP_A-4265735	AA	2.010.474	377.403SNP_A-1995832	BB	397.960	1.183.815SNP_A-1995893	BB	470.733	2.447.332SNP_A-1997689	BB	710.852	3.779.305SNP_A-1997709	AA	1.233.718	327.604SNP_A-1997896	AB	1.044.627	1.807.482SNP_A-1997922	AB	631.873	635.466SNP_A-2000230	NoCall	2.931.884	1.756.351SNP_A-2000332	AA	3.754.281	871.713SNP_A-2000337	AA	1.160.887	284.302SNP_A-2000342	AA	4.995.107	764.680SNP_A-4268173	AA	2.405.663	257.524!sample_table_end
