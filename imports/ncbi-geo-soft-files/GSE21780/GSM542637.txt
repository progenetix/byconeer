The concentration and the quality of the DNA were determined using  NanoDrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Amplification and labeling were performed according to the protocol supplied by the Affymetrix for  SNP 6.0 arrays. 500 ng of gDNA was digested with NspI and StyI restriction enzymes, ligated to respectively NspI and StyI adaptors, amplified by PCR using a single primer. PCR products were purified and the amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 40-70 Âµg of purified amplicons were fragmented and biotin end-labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = Biotin-labeled fragments were hybridized to a Genechip Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays at 50Â°C for 16-18 hours in a GeneChipÂ® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerthrin was performed in a GeneChipÂ® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Inc.).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc.) and raw data processing was performed using the  âGeneChip Operating Softwareâ.!Sample_description = AML45Dx exp11!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was performed by the software "Genotyping Console v3.0.1 ". The following algorithms were used: 1) SNP 6.0 Birdseed v2 algorithm for genotyping, 2) BRLMM-P-Plus algorithm and Hidden Markov Model with regional GC correction for copy number analysis, 3) the LOH algorithm (CN5).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vincenza,,Barresi!Sample_contact_email = barregi@unict.it!Sample_contact_institute = University of Catania!Sample_contact_address = V.le A Doria, 6!Sample_contact_city = Catania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 95125!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542637/suppl/GSM542637.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542637/suppl/GSM542637_AML45Dx_exp11.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542637/suppl/GSM542637_AML45Dx_exp11_BRLMM-P-Plus.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21780!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Birdseed genotype call#Signal A = #Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Signal A	Signal BSNP_A-2131660	AB	2.684.696	2.460.057SNP_A-1967418	BB	208.133	967.747SNP_A-1969580	BB	665.527	4.200.801SNP_A-4263484	BB	361.608	1.710.984SNP_A-1978185	AA	2.624.007	420.559SNP_A-4264431	BB	240.095	1.606.997SNP_A-1980898	AB	609.348	457.657SNP_A-1983139	AA	1.099.920	335.638SNP_A-4265735	AB	784.216	1.007.912SNP_A-1995832	AA	1.475.843	331.722SNP_A-1995893	AA	2.432.247	983.355SNP_A-1997689	BB	615.991	3.940.427SNP_A-1997709	AA	1.509.450	298.446SNP_A-1997896	AA	1.516.960	885.119SNP_A-1997922	AA	1.080.130	267.927SNP_A-2000230	AA	4.617.824	1.647.879SNP_A-2000332	AA	4.973.319	1.942.897SNP_A-2000337	AA	1.891.431	198.645SNP_A-2000342	AA	5.535.207	912.567SNP_A-4268173	AA	3.560.773	210.537!sample_table_end
