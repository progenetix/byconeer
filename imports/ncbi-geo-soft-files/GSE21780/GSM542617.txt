The concentration and the quality of the DNA were determined using  NanoDrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Amplification and labeling were performed according to the protocol supplied by the Affymetrix for  SNP 6.0 arrays. 500 ng of gDNA was digested with NspI and StyI restriction enzymes, ligated to respectively NspI and StyI adaptors, amplified by PCR using a single primer. PCR products were purified and the amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 40-70 Âµg of purified amplicons were fragmented and biotin end-labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = Biotin-labeled fragments were hybridized to a Genechip Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays at 50Â°C for 16-18 hours in a GeneChipÂ® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerthrin was performed in a GeneChipÂ® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Inc.).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc.) and raw data processing was performed using the  âGeneChip Operating Softwareâ.!Sample_description = AML12R exp8!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was performed by the software "Genotyping Console v3.0.1 ". The following algorithms were used: 1) SNP 6.0 Birdseed v2 algorithm for genotyping, 2) BRLMM-P-Plus algorithm and Hidden Markov Model with regional GC correction for copy number analysis, 3) the LOH algorithm (CN5).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vincenza,,Barresi!Sample_contact_email = barregi@unict.it!Sample_contact_institute = University of Catania!Sample_contact_address = V.le A Doria, 6!Sample_contact_city = Catania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 95125!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542617/suppl/GSM542617.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542617/suppl/GSM542617_AML12R_exp8.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542617/suppl/GSM542617_AML12R_exp8_BRLMM-P-Plus.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21780!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Birdseed genotype call#Signal A = #Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Signal A	Signal BSNP_A-2131660	BB	668.561	3.118.862SNP_A-1967418	BB	289.188	744.570SNP_A-1969580	BB	918.922	3.789.297SNP_A-4263484	BB	456.784	2.455.117SNP_A-1978185	AA	2.684.783	431.230SNP_A-4264431	AA	2.053.208	353.529SNP_A-1980898	AB	627.532	632.680SNP_A-1983139	AA	2.056.985	551.418SNP_A-4265735	AA	1.327.535	311.192SNP_A-1995832	AB	1.267.929	943.996SNP_A-1995893	AB	1.358.114	2.098.700SNP_A-1997689	BB	861.329	5.359.085SNP_A-1997709	AA	1.597.949	247.575SNP_A-1997896	AB	800.309	1.846.981SNP_A-1997922	AA	1.043.127	260.251SNP_A-2000230	AA	3.511.283	1.264.915SNP_A-2000332	AA	4.335.681	1.951.899SNP_A-2000337	AA	1.924.853	327.939SNP_A-2000342	AA	5.115.216	1.167.364SNP_A-4268173	AA	2.104.323	218.696!sample_table_end
