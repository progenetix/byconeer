The concentration and the quality of the DNA were determined using  NanoDrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Amplification and labeling were performed according to the protocol supplied by the Affymetrix for  SNP 6.0 arrays. 500 ng of gDNA was digested with NspI and StyI restriction enzymes, ligated to respectively NspI and StyI adaptors, amplified by PCR using a single primer. PCR products were purified and the amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 40-70 Âµg of purified amplicons were fragmented and biotin end-labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = Biotin-labeled fragments were hybridized to a Genechip Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays at 50Â°C for 16-18 hours in a GeneChipÂ® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerthrin was performed in a GeneChipÂ® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Inc.).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc.) and raw data processing was performed using the  âGeneChip Operating Softwareâ.!Sample_description = AML59Dx exp14!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was performed by the software "Genotyping Console v3.0.1 ". The following algorithms were used: 1) SNP 6.0 Birdseed v2 algorithm for genotyping, 2) BRLMM-P-Plus algorithm and Hidden Markov Model with regional GC correction for copy number analysis, 3) the LOH algorithm (CN5).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vincenza,,Barresi!Sample_contact_email = barregi@unict.it!Sample_contact_institute = University of Catania!Sample_contact_address = V.le A Doria, 6!Sample_contact_city = Catania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 95125!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542641/suppl/GSM542641.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542641/suppl/GSM542641_AML59Dx_exp14.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542641/suppl/GSM542641_AML59Dx_exp14_BRLMM-P-Plus.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21780!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Birdseed genotype call#Signal A = #Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Signal A	Signal BSNP_A-2131660	BB	605.140	4.551.952SNP_A-1967418	BB	280.584	740.160SNP_A-1969580	BB	704.305	5.332.542SNP_A-4263484	AB	1.715.848	1.205.313SNP_A-1978185	AA	2.737.637	351.730SNP_A-4264431	BB	286.694	2.358.816SNP_A-1980898	AB	980.683	907.017SNP_A-1983139	AA	4.139.650	529.781SNP_A-4265735	AA	1.540.816	393.901SNP_A-1995832	AB	1.040.558	1.000.661SNP_A-1995893	AB	1.918.871	2.705.048SNP_A-1997689	BB	809.505	4.281.285SNP_A-1997709	NoCall	1.388.296	450.485SNP_A-1997896	AB	1.466.337	2.240.086SNP_A-1997922	AA	1.231.524	229.433SNP_A-2000230	AB	3.235.252	2.624.283SNP_A-2000332	AA	3.326.404	1.662.275SNP_A-2000337	AA	1.295.866	211.472SNP_A-2000342	AA	5.413.854	749.923SNP_A-4268173	AA	1.994.704	297.639!sample_table_end
