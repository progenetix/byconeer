The concentration and the quality of the DNA were determined using  NanoDrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Amplification and labeling were performed according to the protocol supplied by the Affymetrix for  SNP 6.0 arrays. 500 ng of gDNA was digested with NspI and StyI restriction enzymes, ligated to respectively NspI and StyI adaptors, amplified by PCR using a single primer. PCR products were purified and the amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 40-70 Âµg of purified amplicons were fragmented and biotin end-labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = Biotin-labeled fragments were hybridized to a Genechip Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays at 50Â°C for 16-18 hours in a GeneChipÂ® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerthrin was performed in a GeneChipÂ® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Inc.).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc.) and raw data processing was performed using the  âGeneChip Operating Softwareâ.!Sample_description = AML26R exp9!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was performed by the software "Genotyping Console v3.0.1 ". The following algorithms were used: 1) SNP 6.0 Birdseed v2 algorithm for genotyping, 2) BRLMM-P-Plus algorithm and Hidden Markov Model with regional GC correction for copy number analysis, 3) the LOH algorithm (CN5).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vincenza,,Barresi!Sample_contact_email = barregi@unict.it!Sample_contact_institute = University of Catania!Sample_contact_address = V.le A Doria, 6!Sample_contact_city = Catania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 95125!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542627/suppl/GSM542627.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542627/suppl/GSM542627_AML26R_exp9.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542627/suppl/GSM542627_AML26R_exp9_BRLMM-P-Plus.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21780!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Birdseed genotype call#Signal A = #Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Signal A	Signal BSNP_A-2131660	BB	499.560	2.860.928SNP_A-1967418	BB	254.021	873.446SNP_A-1969580	BB	990.365	4.599.491SNP_A-4263484	AB	2.036.538	1.332.415SNP_A-1978185	AA	1.380.135	278.423SNP_A-4264431	AB	1.354.602	1.044.209SNP_A-1980898	BB	257.299	1.093.504SNP_A-1983139	AA	2.181.094	517.994SNP_A-4265735	AB	826.537	765.098SNP_A-1995832	BB	379.153	1.583.659SNP_A-1995893	BB	409.843	2.343.280SNP_A-1997689	BB	605.108	4.634.612SNP_A-1997709	AA	1.538.610	245.850SNP_A-1997896	AA	1.758.850	362.340SNP_A-1997922	BB	452.124	1.273.420SNP_A-2000230	AA	3.886.978	1.105.166SNP_A-2000332	AB	3.028.260	3.287.921SNP_A-2000337	AA	2.073.710	266.762SNP_A-2000342	AA	5.836.247	1.110.010SNP_A-4268173	AA	2.527.814	335.913!sample_table_end
