The concentration and the quality of the DNA were determined using  NanoDrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Amplification and labeling were performed according to the protocol supplied by the Affymetrix for  SNP 6.0 arrays. 500 ng of gDNA was digested with NspI and StyI restriction enzymes, ligated to respectively NspI and StyI adaptors, amplified by PCR using a single primer. PCR products were purified and the amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 40-70 Âµg of purified amplicons were fragmented and biotin end-labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = Biotin-labeled fragments were hybridized to a Genechip Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays at 50Â°C for 16-18 hours in a GeneChipÂ® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerthrin was performed in a GeneChipÂ® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Inc.).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc.) and raw data processing was performed using the  âGeneChip Operating Softwareâ.!Sample_description = AML65Dx exp14!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was performed by the software "Genotyping Console v3.0.1 ". The following algorithms were used: 1) SNP 6.0 Birdseed v2 algorithm for genotyping, 2) BRLMM-P-Plus algorithm and Hidden Markov Model with regional GC correction for copy number analysis, 3) the LOH algorithm (CN5).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vincenza,,Barresi!Sample_contact_email = barregi@unict.it!Sample_contact_institute = University of Catania!Sample_contact_address = V.le A Doria, 6!Sample_contact_city = Catania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 95125!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542643/suppl/GSM542643.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542643/suppl/GSM542643_AML65Dx_exp14.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542643/suppl/GSM542643_AML65Dx_exp14_BRLMM-P-Plus.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21780!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Birdseed genotype call#Signal A = #Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Signal A	Signal BSNP_A-2131660	BB	653.576	4.674.869SNP_A-1967418	BB	271.247	785.049SNP_A-1969580	BB	1.496.964	6.384.187SNP_A-4263484	BB	415.339	1.667.135SNP_A-1978185	AA	1.399.210	316.339SNP_A-4264431	AB	2.081.986	1.377.888SNP_A-1980898	BB	328.355	1.608.468SNP_A-1983139	AA	3.508.391	624.589SNP_A-4265735	AA	1.642.786	351.090SNP_A-1995832	AA	1.755.295	302.611SNP_A-1995893	AA	2.846.747	770.677SNP_A-1997689	BB	543.359	3.373.830SNP_A-1997709	AA	1.573.785	305.653SNP_A-1997896	AA	1.624.840	413.855SNP_A-1997922	AA	1.010.196	240.323SNP_A-2000230	AA	3.132.288	1.129.455SNP_A-2000332	AB	2.047.919	2.244.482SNP_A-2000337	AA	1.932.423	236.165SNP_A-2000342	AA	4.492.126	946.956SNP_A-4268173	AB	1.157.434	961.500!sample_table_end
