The concentration and the quality of the DNA were determined using  NanoDrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Amplification and labeling were performed according to the protocol supplied by the Affymetrix for  SNP 6.0 arrays. 500 ng of gDNA was digested with NspI and StyI restriction enzymes, ligated to respectively NspI and StyI adaptors, amplified by PCR using a single primer. PCR products were purified and the amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 40-70 Âµg of purified amplicons were fragmented and biotin end-labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = Biotin-labeled fragments were hybridized to a Genechip Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays at 50Â°C for 16-18 hours in a GeneChipÂ® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerthrin was performed in a GeneChipÂ® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Inc.).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc.) and raw data processing was performed using the  âGeneChip Operating Softwareâ.!Sample_description = AML43Dx exp10!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was performed by the software "Genotyping Console v3.0.1 ". The following algorithms were used: 1) SNP 6.0 Birdseed v2 algorithm for genotyping, 2) BRLMM-P-Plus algorithm and Hidden Markov Model with regional GC correction for copy number analysis, 3) the LOH algorithm (CN5).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vincenza,,Barresi!Sample_contact_email = barregi@unict.it!Sample_contact_institute = University of Catania!Sample_contact_address = V.le A Doria, 6!Sample_contact_city = Catania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 95125!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542630/suppl/GSM542630.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542630/suppl/GSM542630_AML43Dx_exp10.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542630/suppl/GSM542630_AML43Dx_exp10_BRLMM-P-Plus.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21780!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Birdseed genotype call#Signal A = #Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Signal A	Signal BSNP_A-2131660	BB	500.361	3.025.085SNP_A-1967418	BB	304.737	826.990SNP_A-1969580	BB	854.192	3.575.050SNP_A-4263484	AA	3.200.226	337.960SNP_A-1978185	AA	1.702.265	392.156SNP_A-4264431	AA	1.417.134	326.009SNP_A-1980898	BB	221.728	762.562SNP_A-1983139	AA	923.287	325.201SNP_A-4265735	AB	1.062.432	1.101.265SNP_A-1995832	AB	1.530.934	1.030.182SNP_A-1995893	AB	1.802.382	2.073.655SNP_A-1997689	BB	634.743	3.665.026SNP_A-1997709	AA	1.727.879	278.635SNP_A-1997896	AA	1.685.171	533.027SNP_A-1997922	AB	707.116	681.881SNP_A-2000230	AA	4.087.121	1.174.447SNP_A-2000332	BB	1.256.338	5.108.693SNP_A-2000337	AA	1.676.183	240.584SNP_A-2000342	AA	4.955.119	1.039.033SNP_A-4268173	AA	3.223.583	457.775!sample_table_end
