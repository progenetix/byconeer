The concentration and the quality of the DNA were determined using  NanoDrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Amplification and labeling were performed according to the protocol supplied by the Affymetrix for  SNP 6.0 arrays. 500 ng of gDNA was digested with NspI and StyI restriction enzymes, ligated to respectively NspI and StyI adaptors, amplified by PCR using a single primer. PCR products were purified and the amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 40-70 Âµg of purified amplicons were fragmented and biotin end-labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = Biotin-labeled fragments were hybridized to a Genechip Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays at 50Â°C for 16-18 hours in a GeneChipÂ® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerthrin was performed in a GeneChipÂ® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Inc.).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc.) and raw data processing was performed using the  âGeneChip Operating Softwareâ.!Sample_description = AML18R exp7!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was performed by the software "Genotyping Console v3.0.1 ". The following algorithms were used: 1) SNP 6.0 Birdseed v2 algorithm for genotyping, 2) BRLMM-P-Plus algorithm and Hidden Markov Model with regional GC correction for copy number analysis, 3) the LOH algorithm (CN5).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vincenza,,Barresi!Sample_contact_email = barregi@unict.it!Sample_contact_institute = University of Catania!Sample_contact_address = V.le A Doria, 6!Sample_contact_city = Catania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 95125!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542619/suppl/GSM542619.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542619/suppl/GSM542619_AML18R_exp7.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542619/suppl/GSM542619_AML18R_exp7_BRLMM-P-Plus.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21780!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Birdseed genotype call#Signal A = #Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Signal A	Signal BSNP_A-2131660	BB	577.153	3.485.393SNP_A-1967418	AB	808.102	664.367SNP_A-1969580	BB	893.864	3.604.286SNP_A-4263484	AB	1.319.232	993.497SNP_A-1978185	AA	1.899.704	309.077SNP_A-4264431	AA	1.721.239	370.907SNP_A-1980898	AB	611.032	686.153SNP_A-1983139	AA	1.029.076	366.277SNP_A-4265735	AA	2.435.054	463.973SNP_A-1995832	AB	1.245.758	1.009.364SNP_A-1995893	AB	1.939.278	1.869.574SNP_A-1997689	BB	659.043	3.774.654SNP_A-1997709	AA	1.762.750	463.335SNP_A-1997896	AA	1.508.873	466.378SNP_A-1997922	AB	1.058.339	724.370SNP_A-2000230	AA	3.477.397	797.819SNP_A-2000332	AB	3.314.126	3.384.112SNP_A-2000337	AA	1.651.221	206.959SNP_A-2000342	AA	5.522.670	1.167.953SNP_A-4268173	AA	3.204.540	417.379!sample_table_end
