The concentration and the quality of the DNA were determined using  NanoDrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Amplification and labeling were performed according to the protocol supplied by the Affymetrix for  SNP 6.0 arrays. 500 ng of gDNA was digested with NspI and StyI restriction enzymes, ligated to respectively NspI and StyI adaptors, amplified by PCR using a single primer. PCR products were purified and the amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 40-70 Âµg of purified amplicons were fragmented and biotin end-labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = Biotin-labeled fragments were hybridized to a Genechip Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays at 50Â°C for 16-18 hours in a GeneChipÂ® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerthrin was performed in a GeneChipÂ® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Inc.).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc.) and raw data processing was performed using the  âGeneChip Operating Softwareâ.!Sample_description = AML9Dx exp5!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was performed by the software "Genotyping Console v3.0.1 ". The following algorithms were used: 1) SNP 6.0 Birdseed v2 algorithm for genotyping, 2) BRLMM-P-Plus algorithm and Hidden Markov Model with regional GC correction for copy number analysis, 3) the LOH algorithm (CN5).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vincenza,,Barresi!Sample_contact_email = barregi@unict.it!Sample_contact_institute = University of Catania!Sample_contact_address = V.le A Doria, 6!Sample_contact_city = Catania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 95125!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542614/suppl/GSM542614.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542614/suppl/GSM542614_AML9Dx_exp5.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542614/suppl/GSM542614_AML9Dx_exp5_BRLMM-P-Plus.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21780!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Birdseed genotype call#Signal A = #Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Signal A	Signal BSNP_A-2131660	BB	657.025	2.428.128SNP_A-1967418	BB	299.828	1.031.695SNP_A-1969580	BB	1.226.082	5.584.195SNP_A-4263484	BB	424.776	1.616.779SNP_A-1978185	AA	1.642.635	420.203SNP_A-4264431	AA	2.398.866	428.221SNP_A-1980898	AB	932.531	877.362SNP_A-1983139	AA	1.652.482	452.379SNP_A-4265735	AA	838.614	328.876SNP_A-1995832	BB	607.282	1.466.811SNP_A-1995893	BB	451.410	2.167.124SNP_A-1997689	BB	665.364	3.859.314SNP_A-1997709	AA	1.106.278	163.157SNP_A-1997896	BB	650.456	3.291.347SNP_A-1997922	AA	1.022.659	210.660SNP_A-2000230	AA	2.901.862	1.201.833SNP_A-2000332	AB	2.778.794	2.766.533SNP_A-2000337	AA	1.560.396	268.069SNP_A-2000342	AA	4.397.175	907.288SNP_A-4268173	AB	1.598.866	1.219.422!sample_table_end
