The concentration and the quality of the DNA were determined using  NanoDrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Amplification and labeling were performed according to the protocol supplied by the Affymetrix for  SNP 6.0 arrays. 500 ng of gDNA was digested with NspI and StyI restriction enzymes, ligated to respectively NspI and StyI adaptors, amplified by PCR using a single primer. PCR products were purified and the amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 40-70 Âµg of purified amplicons were fragmented and biotin end-labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = Biotin-labeled fragments were hybridized to a Genechip Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays at 50Â°C for 16-18 hours in a GeneChipÂ® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerthrin was performed in a GeneChipÂ® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Inc.).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc.) and raw data processing was performed using the  âGeneChip Operating Softwareâ.!Sample_description = AML21Dx exp8!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was performed by the software "Genotyping Console v3.0.1 ". The following algorithms were used: 1) SNP 6.0 Birdseed v2 algorithm for genotyping, 2) BRLMM-P-Plus algorithm and Hidden Markov Model with regional GC correction for copy number analysis, 3) the LOH algorithm (CN5).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vincenza,,Barresi!Sample_contact_email = barregi@unict.it!Sample_contact_institute = University of Catania!Sample_contact_address = V.le A Doria, 6!Sample_contact_city = Catania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 95125!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542622/suppl/GSM542622.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542622/suppl/GSM542622_AML21Dx_exp8.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542622/suppl/GSM542622_AML21Dx_exp8_BRLMM-P-Plus.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21780!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Birdseed genotype call#Signal A = #Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Signal A	Signal BSNP_A-2131660	AB	1.893.771	2.025.873SNP_A-1967418	BB	234.618	854.816SNP_A-1969580	BB	1.116.692	4.496.982SNP_A-4263484	BB	541.875	2.466.250SNP_A-1978185	AA	1.995.370	344.291SNP_A-4264431	AA	2.197.330	314.019SNP_A-1980898	BB	269.133	893.467SNP_A-1983139	AA	2.617.484	712.259SNP_A-4265735	AA	1.602.040	392.962SNP_A-1995832	AB	956.810	694.875SNP_A-1995893	AB	1.672.607	2.070.440SNP_A-1997689	BB	730.634	4.534.435SNP_A-1997709	AA	2.049.954	230.470SNP_A-1997896	AA	1.565.173	568.997SNP_A-1997922	AB	1.002.539	736.830SNP_A-2000230	AA	3.515.849	1.077.654SNP_A-2000332	AA	3.766.053	914.968SNP_A-2000337	AA	1.822.655	258.089SNP_A-2000342	AA	4.993.655	1.080.126SNP_A-4268173	AA	1.541.589	342.590!sample_table_end
