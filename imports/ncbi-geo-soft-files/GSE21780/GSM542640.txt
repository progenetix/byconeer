The concentration and the quality of the DNA were determined using  NanoDrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Amplification and labeling were performed according to the protocol supplied by the Affymetrix for  SNP 6.0 arrays. 500 ng of gDNA was digested with NspI and StyI restriction enzymes, ligated to respectively NspI and StyI adaptors, amplified by PCR using a single primer. PCR products were purified and the amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 40-70 Âµg of purified amplicons were fragmented and biotin end-labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = Biotin-labeled fragments were hybridized to a Genechip Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays at 50Â°C for 16-18 hours in a GeneChipÂ® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerthrin was performed in a GeneChipÂ® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Inc.).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc.) and raw data processing was performed using the  âGeneChip Operating Softwareâ.!Sample_description = AML57Dx exp14!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was performed by the software "Genotyping Console v3.0.1 ". The following algorithms were used: 1) SNP 6.0 Birdseed v2 algorithm for genotyping, 2) BRLMM-P-Plus algorithm and Hidden Markov Model with regional GC correction for copy number analysis, 3) the LOH algorithm (CN5).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vincenza,,Barresi!Sample_contact_email = barregi@unict.it!Sample_contact_institute = University of Catania!Sample_contact_address = V.le A Doria, 6!Sample_contact_city = Catania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 95125!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542640/suppl/GSM542640.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542640/suppl/GSM542640_AML57Dx_exp14.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542640/suppl/GSM542640_AML57Dx_exp14_BRLMM-P-Plus.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21780!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Birdseed genotype call#Signal A = #Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Signal A	Signal BSNP_A-2131660	BB	389.130	2.421.848SNP_A-1967418	AB	591.408	543.919SNP_A-1969580	BB	1.221.551	5.450.008SNP_A-4263484	BB	550.451	1.433.427SNP_A-1978185	AA	1.171.431	360.222SNP_A-4264431	AB	1.737.214	1.193.694SNP_A-1980898	AA	1.647.909	314.771SNP_A-1983139	AA	3.087.268	703.493SNP_A-4265735	AA	1.250.196	477.813SNP_A-1995832	AB	974.708	826.146SNP_A-1995893	AB	1.535.948	1.745.244SNP_A-1997689	BB	532.594	3.073.937SNP_A-1997709	AA	1.251.467	220.736SNP_A-1997896	AB	1.328.347	2.077.146SNP_A-1997922	AA	1.290.756	454.211SNP_A-2000230	AA	2.699.019	752.147SNP_A-2000332	AB	2.436.036	2.363.753SNP_A-2000337	AA	1.247.414	221.075SNP_A-2000342	AA	3.642.885	708.403SNP_A-4268173	AB	1.633.031	1.161.935!sample_table_end
