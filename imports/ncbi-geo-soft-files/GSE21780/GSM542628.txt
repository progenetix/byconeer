The concentration and the quality of the DNA were determined using  NanoDrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Amplification and labeling were performed according to the protocol supplied by the Affymetrix for  SNP 6.0 arrays. 500 ng of gDNA was digested with NspI and StyI restriction enzymes, ligated to respectively NspI and StyI adaptors, amplified by PCR using a single primer. PCR products were purified and the amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 40-70 Âµg of purified amplicons were fragmented and biotin end-labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = Biotin-labeled fragments were hybridized to a Genechip Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays at 50Â°C for 16-18 hours in a GeneChipÂ® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerthrin was performed in a GeneChipÂ® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Inc.).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc.) and raw data processing was performed using the  âGeneChip Operating Softwareâ.!Sample_description = AML29Dx exp9!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was performed by the software "Genotyping Console v3.0.1 ". The following algorithms were used: 1) SNP 6.0 Birdseed v2 algorithm for genotyping, 2) BRLMM-P-Plus algorithm and Hidden Markov Model with regional GC correction for copy number analysis, 3) the LOH algorithm (CN5).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vincenza,,Barresi!Sample_contact_email = barregi@unict.it!Sample_contact_institute = University of Catania!Sample_contact_address = V.le A Doria, 6!Sample_contact_city = Catania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 95125!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542628/suppl/GSM542628.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542628/suppl/GSM542628_AML29Dx_exp9.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542628/suppl/GSM542628_AML29Dx_exp9_BRLMM-P-Plus.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21780!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Birdseed genotype call#Signal A = #Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Signal A	Signal BSNP_A-2131660	AB	1.856.730	1.785.625SNP_A-1967418	AB	976.614	840.538SNP_A-1969580	BB	1.199.861	4.242.508SNP_A-4263484	AB	1.720.752	1.444.524SNP_A-1978185	AA	1.596.000	360.651SNP_A-4264431	AA	2.116.863	295.507SNP_A-1980898	BB	298.600	1.496.168SNP_A-1983139	AA	1.954.879	539.618SNP_A-4265735	AA	1.030.236	278.228SNP_A-1995832	BB	448.623	1.383.825SNP_A-1995893	BB	428.099	2.653.266SNP_A-1997689	BB	570.838	4.606.118SNP_A-1997709	AA	1.611.428	286.215SNP_A-1997896	AB	885.309	1.929.044SNP_A-1997922	AB	930.322	753.077SNP_A-2000230	AA	3.265.891	940.429SNP_A-2000332	AA	3.989.702	711.896SNP_A-2000337	AA	1.582.588	227.015SNP_A-2000342	AA	5.134.048	1.172.073SNP_A-4268173	AA	2.152.662	391.085!sample_table_end
