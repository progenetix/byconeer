The concentration and the quality of the DNA were determined using  NanoDrop spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Amplification and labeling were performed according to the protocol supplied by the Affymetrix for  SNP 6.0 arrays. 500 ng of gDNA was digested with NspI and StyI restriction enzymes, ligated to respectively NspI and StyI adaptors, amplified by PCR using a single primer. PCR products were purified and the amplicons were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 40-70 Âµg of purified amplicons were fragmented and biotin end-labeled!Sample_hyb_protocol = Biotin-labeled fragments were hybridized to a Genechip Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays at 50Â°C for 16-18 hours in a GeneChipÂ® Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Washing and staining with streptavidin-phycoerthrin was performed in a GeneChipÂ® Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Inc.).!Sample_scan_protocol = Arrays were scanned with a GeneChipÂ® Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix, Inc.) and raw data processing was performed using the  âGeneChip Operating Softwareâ.!Sample_description = AML63Dx exp14!Sample_data_processing = Data processing was performed by the software "Genotyping Console v3.0.1 ". The following algorithms were used: 1) SNP 6.0 Birdseed v2 algorithm for genotyping, 2) BRLMM-P-Plus algorithm and Hidden Markov Model with regional GC correction for copy number analysis, 3) the LOH algorithm (CN5).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Vincenza,,Barresi!Sample_contact_email = barregi@unict.it!Sample_contact_institute = University of Catania!Sample_contact_address = V.le A Doria, 6!Sample_contact_city = Catania!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 95125!Sample_contact_country = Italy!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542642/suppl/GSM542642.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542642/suppl/GSM542642_AML63Dx_exp14.CN5.CNCHP.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM542nnn/GSM542642/suppl/GSM542642_AML63Dx_exp14_BRLMM-P-Plus.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21780!Sample_data_row_count = 909622#ID_REF = #VALUE = Birdseed genotype call#Signal A = #Signal B = !sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Signal A	Signal BSNP_A-2131660	AA	7.162.396	701.555SNP_A-1967418	BB	198.343	857.342SNP_A-1969580	BB	753.680	4.897.200SNP_A-4263484	BB	374.121	1.847.309SNP_A-1978185	AA	2.434.623	378.515SNP_A-4264431	AA	2.774.892	269.562SNP_A-1980898	AB	966.000	663.819SNP_A-1983139	AA	3.659.046	705.350SNP_A-4265735	AA	1.995.441	269.934SNP_A-1995832	AB	1.072.394	735.303SNP_A-1995893	AB	1.563.086	1.986.270SNP_A-1997689	BB	635.048	4.260.545SNP_A-1997709	AA	1.413.151	286.596SNP_A-1997896	AB	1.028.557	1.843.754SNP_A-1997922	AA	1.218.078	209.507SNP_A-2000230	AA	3.290.141	1.521.874SNP_A-2000332	AA	3.686.040	1.069.446SNP_A-2000337	AA	1.401.367	208.037SNP_A-2000342	AA	4.857.025	832.249SNP_A-4268173	AA	2.481.178	289.471!sample_table_end
