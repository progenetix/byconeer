Human LM5 cells, derived from parental SAOS cells, were kindly provided by E.S. Kleinerman (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). Cells were cultured in DMEM (4.5 g/l glucose)/F12 (1:1) medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Authentication of the human cell lines was performed at the early and late passages by multiplex PCR (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland) using the PowerPlexÂ®16HS system (Promega, Madison, WI) and verified by comparison with the database at the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany).!Sample_molecule_ch1 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = RNA-free DNA from the individual OS cell lines was extracted using the Gentra Puregene kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the protocol recommended by the supplier. DNA concentration and purity was determined with a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wohlen, Switzerland). Since non-degraded DNA was needed, the size of the double-stranded genomic DNA was assessed on a 1% agarose gel. DNA was concentrated and resuspended in nuclease-free water, and the concentration was measured with a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = Microarray CGH was performed with the CytoScan HD Array Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer at the Laboratory for Oncology Diagnostics (Kinderspital Zurich, Switzerland).!Sample_hyb_protocol = standard Affymetrix protocol!Sample_scan_protocol = standard Affymetrix protocol!Sample_description = LM5 cell line early passage!Sample_data_processing = The files obtained from the scanner were analyzed with softwares from different companies: the AffymetrixÂ® Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) 2.0.0.195 and the BioDiscovery Nexus Copy Number 7.0. Copy number variants (CNV) according to the Database of Genomic Variants (http://dgv.tcag.ca/dgv/app/home), DNA copy number alterations smaller than 100 Kb or 50 adjacent probes and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) smaller than 3 Mb were not considered if not known as recurrent aberrations for any neoplasia.!Sample_platform_id = GPL16131!Sample_contact_name = Michael,,Baudis!Sample_contact_email = mbaudis@gmail.com!Sample_contact_department = Institute of Molecular Life Sciences!Sample_contact_institute = University of Zurich!Sample_contact_address = Winterthurerstrasse 190!Sample_contact_city = Zurich!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 8057!Sample_contact_country = Switzerland!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1639nnn/GSM1639705/suppl/GSM1639705_B1001.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1639nnn/GSM1639705/suppl/GSM1639705_B1001.cyhd.cychp.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1639nnn/GSM1639705/suppl/GSM1639705_B1001_events.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE67125!Sample_data_row_count = 2749693
