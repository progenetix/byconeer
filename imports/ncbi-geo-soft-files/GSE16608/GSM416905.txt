DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416905/suppl/GSM416905_KC0071.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416905/suppl/GSM416905_KC0072.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16608!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	4446.122718040481	5836.053890695178	4632.768249708457	5563.600712152028	1.462371442940783	1.796773742169328	.8138873630105451	-0.2207	.85814353447734222	5554.629712199139	3795.323332140448	5750.387231866549	3604.596118318744	1.76139112555624	1.108798661161194	1.588558128047897	0.2445	1.1847090908682913	5029.540818958243	6693.476472114776	5221.435082410371	6391.386593842214	1.525519131759366	1.83711034516345	.830390583655245	0.0156	1.010886130299344	17537.21070641174	15689.89376281607	17065.25175517788	15135.06398755816	5.10328730686779	4.408492779323342	1.157603644221255	-0.1181	.9214014896020555	19501.36959044352	18855.86103130547	18824.46577821585	18253.0512325078	5.604383284962996	5.468196467189349	1.024905253238577	-0.0396	.97293211773479526	11229.14844519876	12801.15278693481	11208.65662147191	12312.42026580378	3.702312120914556	3.963906099610512	.934006010202497	-0.0972	.93484957978254147	2727.754685889746	4039.166266319733	2882.06399943527	3836.66277290499	.8705880541205597	1.151124226521821	.7562937466367851	-0.2579	.83630445203171918	1650.861744169166	1711.590139034891	1778.034554233568	1620.636056153998	.5352070964634139	.4888929112434388	1.094732781259153	0.0044	1.0030613814844049	2684.661166592662	3593.363426425906	2835.758978276841	3411.477255160402	.8619977945807986	1.008683119053296	.8545773972997891	-0.0239	.98360407562830910	25574.02970661709	21387.06913491442	24710.91302598216	20856.29222088223	7.117866578531039	5.843609761440747	1.218059875506834	0.0197	1.01376872330423611	4756.678815961517	13648.82956781344	4946.116035349753	13138.58126195061	1.491438595924404	3.781555222258204	.3943982060993869	-0.7334	.601474155778488512	24614.97808626435	29927.58094778038	23781.88577907116	29578.34833068534	7.353050012339535	8.892526537426441	.8268797378779106	-0.1009	.93245251562492913	5240.823395379359	5636.358131783362	5432.950350237023	5369.96694553029	1.629816734117223	1.619494093033192	1.006373991191717	-0.1103	.926375057068111214	10852.83800000174	10501.79179657221	10854.8961088874	10085.85750833955	3.328007583229023	3.153843807444772	1.055222701699155	-0.0695	.952940215070630815	3213.403933169899	3158.31557693301	3380.352936495357	2996.237602327146	.9736908425176544	.8711245761561226	1.117740067458675	-0.0786	.946946727670403816	4712.924979341609	5756.519927146736	4903.045203132039	5490.326726777034	1.500112649183715	1.587177364848895	.9451449361656759	0.0918	1.06567907244365617	358.2113668400404	482.4038326934727	413.3964372945684	446.8113602730744	.1332544473039085	.1312863599944492	1.014990798050479	0.1245	1.09009733942249518	7788.089342259907	10480.98756979635	7945.124729158797	10065.02827559886	2.350561130195733	3.085222165255481	.7618774286878908	-0.2301	.852595729631360719	1916.288485306033	2171.502732376024	2051.330140033437	2056.566002977146	.5836354979000135	.5786025078195791	1.00869852794002	-0.0135	.990670130991102220	2515.012556434136	2571.829999612165	2661.197456794522	2436.527417188176	.7908038114266082	.732272726574209	1.079930718062142	-0.0781	.9472774251166992!sample_table_end
