DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416908/suppl/GSM416908_KC0109.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416908/suppl/GSM416908_KC0110.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16608!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	4587.603829043162	3487.095399401057	4359.439703583062	3600.966111599206	1.739224120626545	1.469466702197116	1.183575046665632	0.2396	1.1806399630078182	3055.481254940754	2350.68689236182	2949.582705187726	2424.090830320228	1.225083898414323	1.032008314483071	1.187087236819368	-0.0085	.99410745023145873	4197.271809428541	5396.770765863746	4001.016191148144	5532.614859180379	1.614358214864955	2.203549804524917	.7326170761150594	-0.2143	.86196885015105574	13439.80182560345	11262.25277728613	12428.97691523672	11008.67287675281	4.549846778357073	4.064737737860902	1.119345717185548	0.0891	1.0636719726093455	14321.43484073598	11219.70929059776	13306.67452526807	10976.06509376332	5.555014508069141	4.599037445147112	1.207864596521338	0.3243	1.2520762949814386	8764.252908480577	9134.002244121277	8082.087959986504	9086.147179309946	3.27593269093406	3.692469332854846	.8871929312412898	-0.0231	.98409655154093767	3446.507053376507	2821.882733304438	3312.91711213234	2912.039899086875	1.32166942060208	1.12870070794279	1.170965350957387	0.3907	1.3110344799811728	1313.259732391346	1148.80072857451	1323.628577911283	1182.842931198738	.5331522124154884	.4700323779519411	1.134288269115795	0.0869	1.0621088592474049	1886.659243793107	2568.465495163701	1866.207650380941	2648.828256829029	.7409579610117539	1.025679332921615	.7224070303738682	-0.2750	.826444406509160110	13319.75034713899	12751.32872788788	12333.10360770456	12338.75348866857	4.929760695618649	4.78907179464067	1.02937707075835	-0.0784	.947108561925325811	9673.199216791001	18917.83226153108	8910.672863480922	18245.76331137136	3.394875270047464	6.773125432250189	.5012272848045585	-0.9103	.532081716229432912	17950.00982617164	20466.03160577641	17082.64198123574	19745.19661058621	7.174724523664889	8.075523624005072	.8884531651096294	0.0292	1.02044251652741613	5133.559157592966	5020.634888121705	4859.734149609353	5157.848197324723	2.009185589786843	2.082537398295552	.9647776752682838	-0.0308	.97886717045633314	9668.53299158021	9432.207667018445	8906.250814633704	9357.554431701868	3.537637643016544	3.746826002426988	.9441691823226002	-0.1380	.908767772462429315	2638.946924690406	3081.36232460822	2560.968626821726	3181.51288917276	1.025114509060844	1.269111344168245	.8077419792765996	-0.2256	.855253818517649916	4325.890485383106	5757.322974976933	4120.433029346736	5881.694847909451	1.545621197630952	2.27452522683165	.679535746360553	-0.2980	.813362706480085617	482.9013451143627	589.7933778097836	527.9625984796295	606.0854159052983	.2111006193231644	.2424530049674374	.8706867516511754	-0.1593	.895471691223456918	6795.735154417807	6276.494477166531	6338.974323441995	6394.890828520727	2.337261887587885	2.527930471865818	.9245752260989978	0.0285	1.01996553153665619	1704.269730777402	2253.303867714126	1693.541179582963	2324.139332955398	.6602916559545879	.8853026145639171	.7458372369992772	-0.1435	.905301119119310520	1577.257521296509	1795.600321404189	1575.852710675605	1849.617105725555	.6538484633626883	.7514794263985356	.870081655456965	-0.0086	.9940528200780188!sample_table_end
