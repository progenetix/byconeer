DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416899/suppl/GSM416899_KC0037.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416899/suppl/GSM416899_KC0038.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16608!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2882.030863585992	3929.306305867969	3160.809668598292	3552.96655305955	1.651317208059052	1.83022961885205	.9022459209761812	-0.0546	.96284832686763022	1969.488132286276	1930.202838962739	2201.8778209014	1706.3979796578	1.189044611204867	.9016996003797622	1.318670442688547	0.0845	1.0603239744493943	4474.511808844258	4839.710499045767	4788.188670190107	4409.933610152695	2.442406865420108	2.147984781512484	1.137068980395806	0.1034	1.0742747005371744	11631.79280550344	10509.31111888244	11719.19096337119	9744.155709082152	5.66917025025568	4.693397399889009	1.207903309101792	0.1957	1.1452572637918685	10777.20710346954	9814.192814937476	10907.73427011565	9089.681111944476	5.700031858221947	4.943296084801708	1.153083238478642	0.1523	1.1113545810948796	7455.208088963862	9424.435839231863	7698.720192795241	8726.470137497688	4.29915624385063	4.761458487018496	.9029074296398316	-0.1931	.87475079210076167	2426.620920549952	3264.262318422696	2683.453945104731	2930.83486349445	1.28458125515852	1.388763039045154	.9249823181078722	-0.1157	.92291544323380738	1028.193538285887	1210.639383723283	1187.11308680392	1060.431205980571	.6084089978502584	.5465057575014379	1.113270975646872	0.1060	1.0762061599719969	1996.70394220064	2991.004380590201	2230.902668728461	2677.950086228833	1.14388598692036	1.362966297908698	.8392621216500444	-0.0554	.962338779089001510	10140.25031381113	11280.32569166007	10280.36796889168	10467.01899656658	5.316172386785913	5.256399836202862	1.011371385824072	-0.0528	.964060539725204611	8329.04314825095	14831.65590222703	8546.62135607179	13870.59772949636	4.212018056555115	6.535639706576087	.6444691331924298	-0.5633	.676764852371552712	21997.13801290479	24468.19078589924	22419.07176221703	23264.90055583728	11.57576350274093	12.20649664279423	.9483280781938656	0.2314	1.17400923789586713	3996.46558698063	4377.634453013428	4306.840009652164	3975.17540794663	2.22190740994886	2.059590718732999	1.07881016832107	0.1577	1.1154863304380514	9613.434071187745	9113.278267142887	9771.764016072397	8429.99532564921	5.085478728616939	4.297779909477847	1.183280399585374	0.1498	1.10939264016559215	2389.44269812409	2736.769977667066	2644.991021558916	2443.804909690774	1.38261659791798	1.246752764929105	1.108974158157652	0.1210	1.08750416306637216	2649.165646303066	3477.106860340636	2917.44992244615	3128.864493300588	1.471630361614322	1.586716423374958	.9274690423157982	-0.1158	.92285251388539417	541.5521843828649	640.5896642473606	653.5365040301692	555.1129174347591	.3426555335244026	.2820481091712163	1.214883285448281	0.1749	1.12885405247946818	4376.904677884336	6687.717515733598	4691.011326770612	6148.503365037282	2.257299186759788	3.082309449576534	.7323402220597639	-0.2820	.822450585941553319	1799.375761843094	2129.045794798738	2020.756839313456	1887.685125292248	.9866585954048488	.9135271384594932	1.080053951181657	0.1398	1.1017784818495520	1118.607831818727	1659.774961140087	1285.335702613879	1461.965058607778	.6696846222807104	.7434089192069312	.9008294156534066	-0.0058	.995959301764183!sample_table_end
