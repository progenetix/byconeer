DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416904/suppl/GSM416904_KC0051.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416904/suppl/GSM416904_KC0052.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16608!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	3880.610433699226	5601.38211266366	4261.041147705468	5021.850422404486	1.636441054171266	1.949392429514894	.8394620956738272	-0.1858	.87917390494961692	1743.359264350316	2372.243616165568	1959.543129921956	2126.794928413776	.7616214756408132	.8062696804383459	.944623733372612	-0.1123	.92509613830885123	3661.977064746058	5078.67735835787	4027.096962832815	4555.482853150367	1.453462348488256	1.609616489951071	.902986740979796	0.0552	1.038982803816294	6451.010661214695	8121.663060649908	6975.595619503782	7302.90204219638	2.641246398860878	2.696510845357914	.9795052014746488	-0.0638	.9567534584527915	9751.647922884113	11958.26593814933	10466.21796151283	10782.07679099869	3.990331012100915	4.170730489559628	.956746311489007	-0.1435	.9052962627186916	8064.27374777794	9557.07345763662	8677.380774354708	8602.279498072821	3.307520170801464	3.222949916899944	1.026240014918652	0.0336	1.0235948500787167	2080.174584580378	2542.666664179184	2324.402830999006	2279.224719061494	.8699763419669497	.8600132130809389	1.011584855598112	0.0699	1.0496774168269168	1247.318945678856	1554.975015085386	1418.098897091828	1394.101462684535	.5481842301297826	.5281715444271907	1.037890503405093	0.0341	1.0239249728519499	4286.839831035378	6099.127943529873	4692.774294591408	5473.325684856825	1.69093781746619	2.03918188189956	.8292236374182715	-0.0944	.936629620066094610	13646.9556361587	15947.24920835632	14598.8133372562	14500.16602829794	5.545402126510986	5.445231419774001	1.018396042154098	0.0087	1.00607672413406611	15088.10038068558	20905.10545926573	16133.30537885607	19374.76550784712	6.053473241723438	7.121294548669063	.8500523606139571	-0.3986	.75858987786376112	10147.38789998752	14214.63016258336	10887.28149490679	12867.19334103628	4.345964672856332	5.208778567635005	.8343538924576657	-0.0122	.991574458564631613	6249.322112567225	7529.650462656424	6763.931216698426	6768.746680935106	2.549765798322014	2.521407406203214	1.0112470487907	0.0152	1.01056876464406514	6360.998253702339	6735.415738010031	6881.738099023149	6048.988638943207	2.765181883262018	2.42256280121721	1.141428359204005	0.1188	1.08586609262135515	2972.353966158284	3960.99571852142	3292.561210465424	3557.197335909712	1.215587366162113	1.305597133362872	.931058544093983	-0.0310	.978759879826533516	4873.951261821957	6028.320834256612	5316.457611722512	5409.0010807927	1.957754872152793	2.037521693644562	.9608510565847826	-0.0858	.942284752219670517	1140.64503406797	1333.05399616335	1302.30427966955	1194.697362381386	.4554243396759355	.4276265810362432	1.065004749172354	0.1083	1.07799047190126818	5221.453006871611	6871.009382143376	5684.783618656648	6172.25741543638	2.213239504327754	2.498803697090339	.8857196373228111	-0.1642	.892452020726898219	3180.435053989738	3771.015530232446	3516.103448992654	3386.64470539183	1.31523666627143	1.268435973945124	1.036896377339997	0.0937	1.06711093555168820	1282.319113743569	1789.886319736598	1456.342477597886	1605.408940637276	.5524408948998928	.6012672711945871	.9187942224134586	-0.0504	.9656630623311714!sample_table_end
