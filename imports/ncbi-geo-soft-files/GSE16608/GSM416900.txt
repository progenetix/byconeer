DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416900/suppl/GSM416900_KC0044.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416900/suppl/GSM416900_KC0045.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16608!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2238.06699922825	3009.202821956701	2392.739072424577	2795.520215431486	1.448094702203587	1.69289169240853	.8553971342037471	-0.0719	.9513588627977342	1678.387243233554	1617.630945809623	1810.552556873106	1492.971420369586	1.112468660851008	.928045745957381	1.198721793291961	0.0100	1.0069361760555253	2311.009627226249	2398.14075912628	2468.587998427298	2219.646611442064	1.564269311127334	1.430054818586126	1.093852690677903	0.1924	1.1426939388167174	8303.014720864401	8941.40295189291	8322.110530587594	8373.666884570686	5.389856647642026	5.323614812296461	1.012443018077221	0.0375	1.0263273912734045	8239.184967508492	8420.92390881751	8248.097654846015	7871.553247039119	4.992100870935127	4.947036878144382	1.009109289843752	0.1308	1.0949147935123376	5431.783626069298	7171.394233887444	5556.963060684919	6689.851708751044	3.419388376475302	4.109696907789808	.8320293328673352	-0.2315	.85175971536000367	2023.587756201451	2624.81754377031	2169.664587367576	2431.206260204608	1.261141981203196	1.419472929270999	.8884579305438972	-0.1178	.92161059303639438	814.5291534334116	1028.054369802245	903.0527849593612	945.0236920490034	.5605783848757128	.5963341828266651	.940040670180154	-0.0538	.96337117901511129	1381.209934578198	1938.362497539518	1499.215382891514	1789.322247685028	.9226944504336442	1.064706983810351	.8666182005602373	-0.0668	.954775473179585410	7892.440678515891	7476.807819238041	7917.542961390093	6978.980872766867	5.019375590329333	4.341570663651554	1.156119750014088	0.0504	1.03555078836224411	7770.281317595671	13060.3004339607	7800.409154883901	12470.7167562734	4.596599753938969	7.143818236007239	.6434373890940512	-0.7560	.592124316268338212	12624.1965242355	16877.10153648654	12591.6596090419	16322.09424800876	8.210920762430463	10.87976665059522	.7546964035282188	-0.1484	.902252550742618513	2562.114999330758	3014.146836103449	2726.041045050742	2797.266334394021	1.772433859684556	1.795550899885369	.9871253773968258	-0.0261	.982054076562042614	5689.613754025699	6220.3344268612	5806.393440128658	5798.978052172364	3.99189824266608	3.976672840267804	1.003828678649173	-0.0332	.977282869406034415	2306.286066825932	2571.73120330587	2463.449951203074	2381.848493195515	1.470258318524325	1.357074383797748	1.083402896759302	-0.0317	.978246284606433616	2772.321437753418	3903.486936129836	2940.93611550282	3630.197112654437	1.809684221516172	2.173178109493212	.8327362647409478	-0.0222	.98475724795654617	679.8119083490823	729.7309901577866	760.7157907601753	669.6828404384605	.4503072348251276	.3880014252738716	1.16058139350204	0.1035	1.07434046316943818	3255.259307580234	4068.196156402026	3429.133650406194	3784.033921634755	2.119720989170366	2.406464007505954	.8808446677609911	-0.0476	.967549812645674219	1331.791117218948	1589.417851401428	1447.212962200268	1466.14135405734	.8725395478413716	.8365300173802199	1.043046310010397	0.0160	1.01112657038897520	765.0862950552687	1255.17242121725	851.0570402373835	1155.980677652364	.5180616021365796	.6854420471351205	.7558065693545858	-0.2287	.8534298175656111!sample_table_end
