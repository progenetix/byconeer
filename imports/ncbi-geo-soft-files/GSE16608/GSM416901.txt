DNA samples (2 ug) were labeled either with Cy5-dCTP or Cy3-dCTP using Amersham-Pharmacia MegaPrime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and competitively hybridized to each other on the same slide. Each sample genome was analyzed in duplicate, swapping the Cy5 and Cy3 dyes with the control (i.e. "colour reversal").!Sample_source_name_ch2 = SKN1!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = cell line: EBV Immortalized Fibroblast Reference!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = Qiagen Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (cat# 51306).!Sample_label_ch2 = Cy3,Cy5!Sample_label_protocol_ch2 = Briefly, complexity-reduced representations consisting of small (200-1200 bp) fragments were amplified by adapter-mediated PCR of genomic DNA.

Samples were denatured in an MJ Research Tetrad (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 95 degrees C for 5 min, and then pre-annealed at 37 degrees C for no more than 30 min. The solution was then applied to the microarray and hybridized under a coverslip in an oven at 42 degrees C for 14 to 16 h. Thereafter, slides were washed 1 min in 0.2% SDS/0.2x SSC, 30 sec in 0.2x SSC, and 30 sec in 0.05x SSC. Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned immediately.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B scanner using a pixel size of 5 um.!Sample_scan_protocol = Microarrays were scanned and gridded using GenePix Pro 4.0 software (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada) and data were imported into S-Plus 2000 analysis software (Insightful, Seattle, WA).!Sample_description = This experiment was done in colour reversal.!Sample_data_processing = The data were normalized using a lowess curve-fitting algorithm, followed by a local normalization (previously described in Hicks et al.). After placement in genome order, the mean of log ratios was computed for color reversal experiments for each sample. Segmentation was performed on the above-described data. Segments are defined as non-overlapping, genomic regions where copy number has changed. Our segmentation method is based on the minimization of the square-sum of differences between log-ratios and means (squared deviation) over segments larger than 6 probes in size. Initially, the segmenter searches for breakpoints that might be boundaries of segments. The first known breakpoint on a given chromosome is its first probe. For a given breakpoint, a 100-probe window to its right is selected. The sum of squared deviations of the flanking probes is calculated for each probe within this window. A probe whose squared deviation value produces a local minimum with respect to its neighbors, and is below a threshold of 95% of the square deviation within a window, is accepted as a new, known breakpoint. Whenever a probe is found below the threshold in the newly defined region, the segmenter recursively breaks said region into two pieces until it cannot find any further breakpoints therein. If no breakpoints are found, the 100- probe window is shifted by half its size and this procedure continues until a chromosome end is reached. Initial segments are constructed using found breakpoints. Each segment and its neighbors are validated for significance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) algorithm. If the p-value of compared segments is less than 10-5, then said segment is accepted as real. If not, the segments are merged. The segmenter also reports statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for each segment.!Sample_data_processing = !Sample_data_processing = The VALUEs combine the data from both color-reversal (non-dye swap and dye swap) samples.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8581!Sample_contact_name = Nicholas,,Navin!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wigler Lab!Sample_contact_institute = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory!Sample_contact_address = 1 Bungtown Road!Sample_contact_city = Cold Spring Harbor!Sample_contact_state = NY!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 11724!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416901/suppl/GSM416901_KC0047.gpr.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM416nnn/GSM416901/suppl/GSM416901_KC0048.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE16608!Sample_series_id = GSE16672!Sample_data_row_count = 83055#ID_REF = #F635.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 635 nm wavelength#F535.MEDIAN = Median of pixel values for each spot scanned at 532 nm wavelength#LOWRED = Lowess normalized value for each spot in red colour#LOWGREEN = Lowess normalizad value for each spot in green colour#LOCAL.RED = Local normalized output for each spot in red#LOCAL.GREEN = Local normalized value for each spot in green#LOCAL.RATIO = Ratio of local-normalized values for each spot#VALUE = log2 of PRE_VALUE#PRE_VALUE = Geometric mean Ratio (test/reference) of Two Local Ratio Color Reversal Experiments!sample_table_beginID_REF	F635.MEDIAN	F535.MEDIAN	LOWRED	LOWGREEN	LOCAL.RED	LOCAL.GREEN	LOCAL.RATIO	VALUE	PRE_VALUE1	2233.381984967788	3794.165468792354	2350.640084501293	3561.094801677672	1.28569978257041	1.95614728996971	.6572612344494363	-0.3232	.79928437594611662	1228.347344078853	1425.226487508614	1339.877187530384	1332.876549187714	.7377318508464966	.7715895890029032	.9561194984497398	-0.1446	.90461074650788643	3041.753906521232	3496.709358034686	3144.920234192602	3281.108287346078	1.671678236846652	1.739938602923068	.9607685202444846	-0.0061	.99576110575780244	7830.099687750085	8919.206005521295	7603.974888059482	8253.10391532542	3.979451854680413	4.275704193296497	.9307126206063198	0.0069	1.0047838308544145	8921.467941810424	7971.062749841746	8607.445323654327	7403.88923612879	4.790764880823248	4.190149567953279	1.143339826688656	0.0871	1.0622393422082746	8296.599283058313	7602.871601161126	8032.190878720358	7072.412478901814	4.49142608276003	3.953650887273929	1.136019899282736	0.0992	1.0712059515803397	2167.89705019912	2012.629187316924	2285.117448607558	1883.304613890954	1.192017263684015	1.010069965848734	1.180133361041376	0.1877	1.1389348857486688	1066.677628943664	1279.831121639804	1176.236430158307	1199.111085529098	.6335947765068337	.6264181706804206	1.011456573519599	-0.1511	.90053430056233249	1917.306803225772	2087.08863217584	2033.60506979692	1952.937688715579	1.025837563044565	1.01356537745616	1.012107936854754	0.0016	1.00111212536907110	9944.614163139311	9409.17616446452	9577.90264851517	8684.264494411484	4.992732425564686	4.537313727169056	1.100371877674806	0.0617	1.04366649310198511	3101.763750245797	8549.960815190389	3202.003196449825	7922.597918743762	1.762294001984683	4.171313241515241	.42247942073622	-1.0624	.478842893995291712	12820.31316805365	15689.34270163276	12472.2807841418	14676.70803624017	6.945679956657155	8.144396794776387	.8528169896034462	-0.0600	.959272512776812413	3139.530330376774	4045.417422836125	3240.428353118402	3795.842952491944	1.794212720327662	2.157927175763482	.8314519324281011	-0.1279	.915190765225410214	6219.31251558872	5769.725437735035	6138.423193261059	5396.565537960882	3.475662189758204	3.144429079308606	1.105339666468938	0.1283	1.09300180982803815	1626.300097271483	1934.686053831435	1742.468585477548	1810.000535921621	.9529098024414207	1.010605748321254	.9429095411581871	0.0282	1.0197255423655516	2834.328285680548	3760.449633661958	2943.349142807701	3529.49312763821	1.567549830349788	1.891713860056469	.8286400303177966	-0.1833	.880692854475080817	387.6669062626764	495.5695884809041	467.754402643041	466.894695001017	.2539652994559562	.2576311640302666	.9857708806769984	0.0643	1.04554547653464518	4326.198789488876	6491.869258682431	4376.752500782038	6064.205558520935	2.216231864115962	3.139078923254804	.706013425689223	-0.2993	.812649778478628319	1377.887307553683	1700.689281959701	1491.16747786689	1589.916589390386	.7632567512563645	.8219544983802018	.9285875954940194	0.0025	1.00171552059449120	1314.320984299774	1744.33580823766	1427.27136481097	1631.062758748786	.7578320912299431	.8586033793447697	.8826334830038419	-0.1126	.9249313394496012!sample_table_end
