DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer, PicoGreen and agarose gel electrophoresis.!Sample_label_ch1 = biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to Mapping50K_Xba240!Sample_data_processing = CEL files and CHP files (generated by Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console using the BRLMM algorithm) were processed by Affymetrix Genotyping Console 4.0. For this analysis, the protocol of un-paired samples was followed. Briefly, the parameters were set as follows: quantile normalization was performed at the perfect match (PM) probe level, followed by summarization of the signal intensity for each allele of each SNP. Genomic smoothing was set to 0.5 Mb and a five state Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was applied for smoothing and segmenting CN data. The different states were defined as follows: 0=homozygous deletion; 1=heterozygous deletion; 2=normal diploid; 3=single copy gain and 4=amplification. Each SNP was fitted to one of the possible CN states with a transition decay of 10 Mb and a threshold for SNP outlier of 1000 bp.!Sample_data_processing = CHP files of 4 cell lines and 38 healty controls.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2005!Sample_contact_name = Jaime,,Berumen!Sample_contact_email = jaimeberumen@hotmail.com!Sample_contact_phone = +52(55)27892000!Sample_contact_laboratory = Unidad de Medicina GenÃ³mica!Sample_contact_department = Departamento de Medicina Experimental!Sample_contact_institute = Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico!Sample_contact_address = Dr. Balmis #148 Col.
