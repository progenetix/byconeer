For this analysis, the protocol of un-paired samples was followed. Briefly, the parameters were set as follows: quantile normalization was performed at the perfect match (PM) probe level, followed by summarization of the signal intensity for each allele of each SNP. Genomic smoothing was set to 0.5 Mb and a five state Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was applied for smoothing and segmenting CN data. The different states were defined as follows: 0=homozygous deletion; 1=heterozygous deletion; 2=normal diploid; 3=single copy gain and 4=amplification. Each SNP was fitted to one of the possible CN states with a transition decay of 10 Mb and a threshold for SNP outlier of 1000 bp.!Sample_data_processing = CHP files of 4 cell lines and 38 healty controls.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2004!Sample_contact_name = Jaime,,Berumen!Sample_contact_email = jaimeberumen@hotmail.com!Sample_contact_phone = +52(55)27892000!Sample_contact_laboratory = Unidad de Medicina GenÃ³mica!Sample_contact_department = Departamento de Medicina Experimental!Sample_contact_institute = Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico!Sample_contact_address = Dr. Balmis #148 Col.
