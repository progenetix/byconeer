The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Richard,,Rosenquist Brandell!Sample_contact_email = richard.rosenquist@genpat.uu.se!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Rudbeck Laboratory!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-751 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM337nnn/GSM337746/suppl/GSM337746.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM337nnn/GSM337746/suppl/GSM337746.CHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE13557!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or No Call#B_Allele_Freq = Estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_RatioSNP_A-1780520	BB	NA	-0.03SNP_A-1780618	BB	1.1445	-0.0048SNP_A-1780632	AB	0.5359	0.0353SNP_A-1780654	AA	NA	0.0057SNP_A-4192495	AB	0.381	-0.1012SNP_A-4192498	BB	1.0705	0.0555SNP_A-1780732	BB	0.9837	-0.3088SNP_A-1780848	BB	0.9367	0.177SNP_A-1780985	AB	0.0555	-0.231SNP_A-1781022	AA	0.0599	0.2492SNP_A-1781076	BB	0.9944	0.0524SNP_A-1781249	AA	0.051	0.3021SNP_A-1781276	AB	0.4733	0.254SNP_A-1781302	BB	1.0188	-0.187SNP_A-1781510	AA	0.0007	-0.1854SNP_A-4192564	BB	0.8053	0.0768SNP_A-1781614	AA	-0.0536	0.1161SNP_A-1781633	AB	0.502	0.2605SNP_A-1781764	BB	1.0058	0.4109SNP_A-1781829	AA	NA	0.0474!sample_table_end
