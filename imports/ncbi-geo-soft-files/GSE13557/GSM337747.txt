The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Richard,,Rosenquist Brandell!Sample_contact_email = richard.rosenquist@genpat.uu.se!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Rudbeck Laboratory!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-751 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM337nnn/GSM337747/suppl/GSM337747.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM337nnn/GSM337747/suppl/GSM337747.CHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE13557!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or No Call#B_Allele_Freq = Estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_RatioSNP_A-1780520	BB	NA	0.0227SNP_A-1780618	BB	1.0362	0.0412SNP_A-1780632	AA	0.0041	0.0861SNP_A-1780654	AA	NA	0.0343SNP_A-4192495	BB	0.9814	0.069SNP_A-4192498	AB	-1.0051	0.2082SNP_A-1780732	BB	1.0147	-0.1864SNP_A-1780848	BB	0.968	0.154SNP_A-1780985	BB	0.9797	0.3189SNP_A-1781022	AA	0.034	-0.1026SNP_A-1781076	BB	1.0068	-0.115SNP_A-1781249	AA	0.0606	0.0316SNP_A-1781276	AB	0.5316	0.2648SNP_A-1781302	BB	0.9849	0.0337SNP_A-1781510	AA	-0.0029	-0.3694SNP_A-4192564	BB	0.772	0.01SNP_A-1781614	AA	-0.0432	-0.0575SNP_A-1781633	AA	0.0192	-0.2341SNP_A-1781764	AA	0.0813	0.4138SNP_A-1781829	AA	NA	0.0378!sample_table_end
