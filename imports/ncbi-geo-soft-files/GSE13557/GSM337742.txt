The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Richard,,Rosenquist Brandell!Sample_contact_email = richard.rosenquist@genpat.uu.se!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Rudbeck Laboratory!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-751 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM337nnn/GSM337742/suppl/GSM337742.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM337nnn/GSM337742/suppl/GSM337742.CHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE13557!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or No Call#B_Allele_Freq = Estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_RatioSNP_A-1780520	BB	NA	-0.1036SNP_A-1780618	BB	1.0088	0.2432SNP_A-1780632	AA	-0.0403	-0.0895SNP_A-1780654	AA	NA	0.0233SNP_A-4192495	AB	0.4934	0.0062SNP_A-4192498	BB	0.9873	0.0865SNP_A-1780732	BB	0.9914	-0.2241SNP_A-1780848	AB	0.5505	0.2028SNP_A-1780985	AA	0.0515	-0.0597SNP_A-1781022	AA	0.0479	-0.0195SNP_A-1781076	BB	0.9813	0.0895SNP_A-1781249	AA	-0.0272	0.092SNP_A-1781276	AB	0.5124	0.2705SNP_A-1781302	BB	0.9965	0.0294SNP_A-1781510	AA	0.0003	0.0569SNP_A-4192564	BB	1.0726	-0.0485SNP_A-1781614	BB	0.9938	0.1011SNP_A-1781633	AA	0.0222	-0.2137SNP_A-1781764	AB	0.5021	0.4755SNP_A-1781829	AA	NA	-0.1477!sample_table_end
