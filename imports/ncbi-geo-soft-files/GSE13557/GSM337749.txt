The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Richard,,Rosenquist Brandell!Sample_contact_email = richard.rosenquist@genpat.uu.se!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Rudbeck Laboratory!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-751 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM337nnn/GSM337749/suppl/GSM337749.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM337nnn/GSM337749/suppl/GSM337749.CHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE13557!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or No Call#B_Allele_Freq = Estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_RatioSNP_A-1780520	BB	NA	-0.0617SNP_A-1780618	AB	0.4646	-0.0722SNP_A-1780632	AB	0.5339	-0.1599SNP_A-1780654	AA	NA	-0.111SNP_A-4192495	BB	0.8928	-0.2029SNP_A-4192498	AB	0.5145	0.1687SNP_A-1780732	BB	1.0157	-0.451SNP_A-1780848	AB	0.4561	0.3234SNP_A-1780985	BB	1.0552	0.0738SNP_A-1781022	AA	-0.0109	-0.1265SNP_A-1781076	BB	1.0071	0.062SNP_A-1781249	AB	0.569	0.0312SNP_A-1781276	AA	0.1426	0.2991SNP_A-1781302	BB	0.9517	-0.0283SNP_A-1781510	AA	0.03	-0.1917SNP_A-4192564	BB	0.9528	0.1333SNP_A-1781614	AB	0.498	0.0075SNP_A-1781633	BB	0.9487	0.4275SNP_A-1781764	BB	1.0354	0.3325SNP_A-1781829	AA	NA	0.0682!sample_table_end
