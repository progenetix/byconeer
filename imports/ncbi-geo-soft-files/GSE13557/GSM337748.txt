The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Richard,,Rosenquist Brandell!Sample_contact_email = richard.rosenquist@genpat.uu.se!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Rudbeck Laboratory!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-751 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM337nnn/GSM337748/suppl/GSM337748.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM337nnn/GSM337748/suppl/GSM337748.CHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE13557!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or No Call#B_Allele_Freq = Estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_RatioSNP_A-1780520	BB	NA	-0.0956SNP_A-1780618	AB	0.5391	0.2969SNP_A-1780632	BB	1.0415	-0.4182SNP_A-1780654	AA	NA	0.0642SNP_A-4192495	BB	0.9278	0.1034SNP_A-4192498	BB	1.0133	0.3675SNP_A-1780732	BB	0.9524	-0.2256SNP_A-1780848	BB	0.9453	0.1575SNP_A-1780985	AB	0.6438	0.166SNP_A-1781022	AA	0.1253	-0.0286SNP_A-1781076	BB	1.0007	-0.1129SNP_A-1781249	AA	0.0154	0.0245SNP_A-1781276	AA	-0.0416	0.1669SNP_A-1781302	BB	0.9503	0.1572SNP_A-1781510	AA	0.0131	0.0353SNP_A-4192564	BB	1.0136	0.0895SNP_A-1781614	AA	-0.0816	0.2019SNP_A-1781633	AA	-0.0186	-0.3104SNP_A-1781764	AB	0.5324	0.3988SNP_A-1781829	AA	NA	-0.1376!sample_table_end
