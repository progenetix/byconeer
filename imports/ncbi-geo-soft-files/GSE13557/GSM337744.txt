The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Richard,,Rosenquist Brandell!Sample_contact_email = richard.rosenquist@genpat.uu.se!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Rudbeck Laboratory!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-751 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM337nnn/GSM337744/suppl/GSM337744.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM337nnn/GSM337744/suppl/GSM337744.CHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE13557!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or No Call#B_Allele_Freq = Estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_RatioSNP_A-1780520	BB	NA	-0.1031SNP_A-1780618	BB	1.1114	0.0793SNP_A-1780632	BB	0.9628	-0.325SNP_A-1780654	AA	NA	0.1027SNP_A-4192495	AA	-0.0829	-0.1095SNP_A-4192498	BB	1.0683	0.1061SNP_A-1780732	BB	0.9706	-0.0157SNP_A-1780848	BB	0.98	-0.0797SNP_A-1780985	BB	0.9846	0.3351SNP_A-1781022	AB	0.3582	0.0232SNP_A-1781076	AA	-0.0103	0.1977SNP_A-1781249	AB	0.5696	0.1606SNP_A-1781276	AB	0.5357	-0.0268SNP_A-1781302	BB	1.0218	-0.2732SNP_A-1781510	No Call	0.5294	-0.4961SNP_A-4192564	BB	0.93	0.2524SNP_A-1781614	AA	-0.0556	-0.1915SNP_A-1781633	AB	0.4616	0.2481SNP_A-1781764	BB	1.0168	0.2154SNP_A-1781829	AA	NA	-0.0224!sample_table_end
