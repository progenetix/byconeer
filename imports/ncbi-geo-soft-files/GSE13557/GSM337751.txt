The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Richard,,Rosenquist Brandell!Sample_contact_email = richard.rosenquist@genpat.uu.se!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Rudbeck Laboratory!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-751 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM337nnn/GSM337751/suppl/GSM337751.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM337nnn/GSM337751/suppl/GSM337751.CHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE13557!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or No Call#B_Allele_Freq = Estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_RatioSNP_A-1780520	BB	NA	-0.2893SNP_A-1780618	AA	0.1071	-0.0871SNP_A-1780632	BB	1.0086	-0.037SNP_A-1780654	AA	NA	-0.0702SNP_A-4192495	BB	0.9828	-0.1846SNP_A-4192498	AB	-4.2586	0.3656SNP_A-1780732	BB	0.9699	-0.1923SNP_A-1780848	BB	0.8654	0.2535SNP_A-1780985	AB	0.4363	0.1896SNP_A-1781022	AA	0.0672	0.0607SNP_A-1781076	BB	1.0282	0.2477SNP_A-1781249	AB	0.4817	0.1331SNP_A-1781276	AB	0.4296	0.1739SNP_A-1781302	BB	1.0024	-0.104SNP_A-1781510	AA	0.0117	-0.2448SNP_A-4192564	BB	0.8851	-0.0139SNP_A-1781614	BB	1.0508	-0.2583SNP_A-1781633	AB	0.4905	0.1628SNP_A-1781764	BB	0.9492	0.3282SNP_A-1781829	AA	NA	0.0389!sample_table_end
