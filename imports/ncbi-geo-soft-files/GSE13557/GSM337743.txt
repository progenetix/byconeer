The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Richard,,Rosenquist Brandell!Sample_contact_email = richard.rosenquist@genpat.uu.se!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Rudbeck Laboratory!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-751 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM337nnn/GSM337743/suppl/GSM337743.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM337nnn/GSM337743/suppl/GSM337743.CHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE13557!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or No Call#B_Allele_Freq = Estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_RatioSNP_A-1780520	BB	NA	-0.0958SNP_A-1780618	BB	1.032	-0.0297SNP_A-1780632	AA	0.1196	0.067SNP_A-1780654	AA	NA	0.0387SNP_A-4192495	AB	0.4603	-0.0541SNP_A-4192498	BB	1.0348	0.1067SNP_A-1780732	BB	0.9672	-0.2547SNP_A-1780848	BB	0.9625	0.1738SNP_A-1780985	BB	0.9565	0.0811SNP_A-1781022	AA	0.0467	-0.1051SNP_A-1781076	AB	0.5603	-0.155SNP_A-1781249	No Call	0.2482	0.116SNP_A-1781276	AA	0.1413	0.3892SNP_A-1781302	AB	0.5577	0.0446SNP_A-1781510	AA	0.0363	-0.2721SNP_A-4192564	BB	1.0302	-0.1045SNP_A-1781614	AA	-0.1124	0.2118SNP_A-1781633	AA	0.0358	-0.1702SNP_A-1781764	BB	0.9339	0.4218SNP_A-1781829	AA	NA	-0.0722!sample_table_end
