The Dynamic Model (DM) algorithm was used to perform single sample QC. The QC specification for 250K is a Call Rate > 93% using the algorithm defaults. Genotype calls were made using the BRLMM algorithm. Parameter settings(CNAT 4.0.1): Transition decay 5 Mb, Median normalization and 0Mb smoothing factor. The reference set used consisted of 96 CEU samples from the HapMap project (www.hapmap.org/downloads/raw_data/affy500k/).!Sample_platform_id = GPL3718!Sample_contact_name = Richard,,Rosenquist Brandell!Sample_contact_email = richard.rosenquist@genpat.uu.se!Sample_contact_department = Genetics and Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Uppsala University!Sample_contact_address = Rudbeck Laboratory!Sample_contact_city = Uppsala!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-751 85!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM337nnn/GSM337745/suppl/GSM337745.CEL.gz!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM337nnn/GSM337745/suppl/GSM337745.CHP.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE13557!Sample_data_row_count = 262264#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or No Call#B_Allele_Freq = Estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = GTYPE metric for relative signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_RatioSNP_A-1780520	BB	NA	-0.1107SNP_A-1780618	AB	0.4062	-0.1964SNP_A-1780632	AB	0.4131	-0.0492SNP_A-1780654	AA	NA	0.0027SNP_A-4192495	AB	0.5131	-0.025SNP_A-4192498	AB	0.6429	-0.1956SNP_A-1780732	AB	0.4092	0.3619SNP_A-1780848	BB	0.9223	-0.0285SNP_A-1780985	BB	0.9544	0.3996SNP_A-1781022	AA	-0.0015	0.1376SNP_A-1781076	BB	0.9628	0.0988SNP_A-1781249	AB	0.5505	0.0951SNP_A-1781276	AB	0.5603	0.1323SNP_A-1781302	BB	0.9807	0.0149SNP_A-1781510	AA	-0.0019	-0.0782SNP_A-4192564	BB	0.9097	-0.0342SNP_A-1781614	AB	0.4816	-0.1838SNP_A-1781633	AA	-0.0338	-0.07SNP_A-1781764	BB	0.845	0.1859SNP_A-1781829	AA	NA	0.0633!sample_table_end
