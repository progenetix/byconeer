To identify regions of similar genomic status within the array-CGH data, we applied the segmentation software GLAD. Imbalances with log2 ratios of less than -1.0 were scored as putative homozygous deletions, because this threshold corresponds to an average copy number of less than 1, suggesting the presence of at least one subpopulation of cells with homozygous deletions. Gains with log2 ratios higher than 1.0 were scored as amplifications.!Sample_platform_id = GPL8175!Sample_contact_name = Aurelie,,Ernst!Sample_contact_institute = DKFZ!Sample_contact_address = Im Neuenheimer Feld 280!Sample_contact_city = Heidelberg!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 69120!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM371nnn/GSM371066/suppl/GSM371066_GCC_103_wdh.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE14820!Sample_series_id = GSE14824!Sample_data_row_count = 7971#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2 ratio (glioblastoma/reference DNA)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEG007563	-0.031G007109	-0.221G007107	0.705G007641	0.046G000001	G003128	0.564G007091	-0.010G003295	0.147G007108	0.006G007087	-0.040G007105	0.019G008027	0.089G006935	-0.042G003545	0.098G004383	0.083G007635	-0.134G007004	0.052G004055	0.066G004626	0.067G006958	0.096!sample_table_end
