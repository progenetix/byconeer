Briefly, array blocking was performed using Agilent 10X blocking agent, and labelled DNA suspended in Agilent 2x HiRPM Hybridization buffer. Samples were hybridized for 24hrs at 65 degrees. Washing was performed with 5 minutes in Agilent oligo aCGH wash buffer 1 at RT, and 1 minute in buffer 2 at 37 degrees.!Sample_scan_protocol = Scanning was perfomed in an Agilent High Resolution C scanner at 3 microns resolution.!Sample_description = C1!Sample_data_processing = Data was analyzed using the Agilent Feature Extraction Software (v10.5) and visualized in Genomic Workbench Standard Edition (v5.0.14).
