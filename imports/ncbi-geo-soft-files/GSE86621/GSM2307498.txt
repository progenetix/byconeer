From each OCT block, 3x20 Âµm cuts were obtained using a microtome; the slices were washed twice in PBS and homogenized using the TissueLyser II (Qiagen). DNA extraction was performed using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen). From one of the patients (H380) a peripheral blood sample was included as a normal control sample (BB39). Mononuclear cells were isolated from the blood sample by Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Health Care, Uppsala, Sweden) and stored in 10 % DMSO and 20 % serum at â 80 oC. For DNA extraction, the cells were thawed, washed twice in PBS and genomic DNA extracted using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen). The DNA was eluted in water and the concentration measured using a Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific). The saliva sample was collected using the Oragene DNA Self-Collection Kit (OG-500) and the DNA purified from non-involved mucosa cells using the Oragene DNA purifier (OG-L2P) following manufactures instructions in protocol PD-PR-006 Issue 3.2 (DNA Genotek Inc, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada).!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = Hybridized to SNP6.0!Sample_data_processing = The .CEL files, generated through AGCC after scanning the arrays, were imported to Partek Genomics Suite Software v. 6.6 (6.14.0828) using interrogating probes only with a pre-background adjustment for GC content and probe sequence. Probe sets wire summarized using allele specific summarization, and normalized against the human Hapmap genome (default in the Partek software).!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Julie,StÃ¸ve,BÃ¸dker!Sample_contact_email = j.boedker@rn.dk!Sample_contact_laboratory = Research Laboratory!Sample_contact_department = Department of Heamatology!Sample_contact_institute = Aalborg University Hospital!Sample_contact_address = Sdr.
