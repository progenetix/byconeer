DNA quality and quantity was assessed using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.!Sample_label_ch1 = Biotin!Sample_label_protocol_ch1 = As per manufacturer (Affymetrix)!Sample_hyb_protocol = DNA was restriction digested, methylated genomic DNA  was immunoprecipitated and purified with 5-hmc antibody,  PCR amplified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to each array according to the manufacturer's instructions.!Sample_scan_protocol = The Arrays were then washed using Affymetrix fluidics stations, and scanned using the Gene Chip Scanner 3000.!Sample_description = 19381T!Sample_description = Hybridized to Affymetrix SNP 6.0!Sample_data_processing = The array image was acquired using Affymetrix GeneChipÂ® Operating Software (GCOS version 1.4). Copy number analysis on CEL files were performed using Partek genomics suite. The values in the data matrix ( copy_number.txt available on Series records) represent copy number of each locus for methylation enrich DNA. The matched plain DNA is the baseline for the calculation: autosomal chromosome=2 and sex chromosome=1. The general rule in the assay is that when the value is significantly less than 2 in autosomal chromosomes, the DNA is not methylated, while higher than 2, hypermethylated.!Sample_data_processing = Amplification called in methylated Genomic DNA (5mc_data) were obtained using matched genomic DNA as baseline.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Yan P.,,Yu!Sample_contact_email = ypyu@pitt.edu!Sample_contact_department = Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = University of Pittsburgh!Sample_contact_address = 3550 Terrace st.!Sample_contact_city = Pittsburgh!Sample_contact_state = PA!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 15261!Sample_contact_country = USA!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM1095nnn/GSM1095524/suppl/GSM1095524_Yu_SNP_19381T.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE45000!Sample_data_row_count = 0
