SEG Files were created from CEL files by  SNPFileCreator (Genepattern, Broad Institute). SEG files (.seg) list loci and associated numeric copy number values as tab delimited text files. The first row contains column headings. Next, copy numbers were determined by using IGV 2.1 Software (Genepattern, Broad Institute). IGV reads the first four columns as track name, chromosome, start location, and end location and the last column as the numeric value for that locus. The numeric copy number value was then determined as the inferred copy number from IGV 2.1 for each sample separately.!Sample_platform_id = GPL6801!Sample_contact_name = Felix,,Dietlein!Sample_contact_department = Department of Translational Genomics!Sample_contact_institute = University of Cologne!Sample_contact_address = Weyertal 115b!Sample_contact_city = Cologne!Sample_contact_state = NRW!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 50931!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM986nnn/GSM986176/suppl/GSM986176_CBE_ROM4-P4-1_H69AR_270110_GWS6.CEL.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE40142!Sample_data_row_count = 0
