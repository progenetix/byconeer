Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM700983!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804328!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804329!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	AB	0.2524362	0.6852262	1.547188	0.4428547	0.7697308142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9851434	0.9230263	1	0.908229784234	BB	0.8676848	0.9938197	1.309903	1	-0.005660486252381	AB	0.8262474	0.6110494	0.5469843	0.4666694	-0.500982622860	AA	0.8808271	0.004372771	0.7346848	0	0.623278398390	AA	0.8797263	0.01240381	1.862819	0	0.3817669138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9872712	1.49805	1	0.96039481607	AA	0.784545	0.1011103	0.2941481	0.03099854	-0.6876165146488	AB	0.8071557	0.5429727	1.965263	0.4546871	0.350319156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9923401	2.141051	0.9999714	0.32050976178	BB	0.8811052	0.9566618	1.150084	0.9882015	0.6693522260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9833782	1.936141	1	0.5744552128978	BB	0.850426	0.973096	1.148587	0.9758471	0.2120144156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01355733	2.462517	0	0.84244221283	BB	0.8091115	1	1.777343	1	0.59416844671	AA	0.8078112	0.002962766	2.867113	0	0.04640378240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9816802	1.554766	0.9991384	0.6007714239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9865437	1.853083	1	0.9307636248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9859073	0.5535915	0.993033	0.3247644278305	AB	0.6793056	0.7681047	1.188404	0.5214145	0.7855718!sample_table_end
