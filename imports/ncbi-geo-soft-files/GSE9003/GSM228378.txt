Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9926351	1.842726	1	0.7899173142066	NC	0	0.2216313	1.239354	0.1648764	1.49094584234	BB	0.8676848	0.9949729	1.719794	1	0.3881057252381	AA	0.5307616	0.2983767	0.7353601	0.1739585	0.0246894822860	AA	0.8808271	0.01013461	1.119471	0.0008408427	1.22899198390	AA	0.8063304	0.0154324	2.871253	0	1.005921138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9873954	1.820035	1	1.24123481607	AA	0.784545	0.1073688	0.4706703	0.03850885	-0.006826283146488	NC	0	0.2853051	2.842511	0.2205937	0.9291944156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9878353	2.51875	0.9955406	0.5492046178	BB	0.8811052	0.9667511	1.491624	1	1.046329260311	BB	0.734789	0.9739822	2.668654	0.9918763	1.027185128978	BB	0.850426	0.9593932	1.431699	0.9534313	0.5301991156724	NC	0.213203	0.01696721	3.188732	0	1.2141821283	BB	0.8091115	0.9981803	2.369037	1	1.00919244671	AA	0.8078112	0.00272903	4.035283	0	0.5393948240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9798741	1.818099	0.9969242	0.8256885239834	BB	0.7002718	0.977329	2.103941	0.9959754	1.102228248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9861622	0.6556405	0.9934857	0.5686736278305	NC	0	0.4165446	1.489152	0.2339413	1.303347!sample_table_end
