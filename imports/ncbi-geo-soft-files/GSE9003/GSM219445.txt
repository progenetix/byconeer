Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9997944	1.591121	1	0.5728025142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9897355	0.7935257	1	0.689428384234	AB	0.865445	0.6083143	1.56766	0.6014631	-0.0443919252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9821486	0.4354408	1	-0.787844622860	NC	0	0.4136553	0.7054689	0.3291551	0.435151898390	NC	0.009685024	0.3187497	1.895643	0.2987972	0.4030728138233	AB	0.8618885	0.7256179	1.600586	0.5387492	1.1413881607	AA	0.784545	0.07804015	0.3047195	0.003314037	-0.6462792146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9665497	1.947973	1	0.4622837156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9953174	2.190551	1	0.35726086178	BB	0.8811052	0.9555249	1.296617	0.9866172	0.84216260311	AB	0.5319579	0.300444	3.279057	0.3099076	0.7538385128978	AB	0.850426	0.7352479	1.192805	0.5867602	0.2720028156724	BB	0.9236776	0.9966002	2.055713	1	0.60594991283	BB	0.8091115	0.9980685	2.155077	1	0.872657744671	AA	0.8078112	0.002430747	3.12291	0	0.1695138240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9876698	1.667895	1	0.7048116239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9831575	1.773439	1	0.8630739248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9862744	0.5156679	0.9936848	0.2221341278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9876956	1.368692	1	0.7361704!sample_table_end
