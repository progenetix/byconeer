Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9975549	1.968875	1	0.8817914142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9842216	0.9318362	1	0.922076484234	BB	0.8676848	0.994296	1.252268	1	-0.07016759252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9808347	0.4845929	0.9989005	-0.633759422860	AA	0.8808271	0.006259232	0.8871771	0	0.894750198390	AA	0.8204898	0.00665038	2.851416	0	0.9960312138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9855412	1.775306	1	1.20592481607	NC	0.2270851	0.8267906	0.1832282	0.8757747	-0.9244468146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9535089	2.386324	1	0.7502264156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9921311	3.06289	0.9997659	0.83681946178	BB	0.8811052	0.9621369	1.251142	0.9958318	0.7918518260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9812243	2.46552	0.9987187	0.920819128978	BB	0.850426	0.9866014	1.207316	0.9979401	0.2836471156724	NC	0.01997543	0.008979314	3.635753	0	1.4060531283	BB	0.8091115	1	2.148654	1	0.867879244671	AA	0.8078112	0.001901511	5.47185	0	0.9784703240130	BB	0.8949394	0.98092	1.870072	0.9982064	0.8668239239834	BB	0.6751919	0.9898676	2.290736	1	1.240892248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9803076	0.5639513	0.9830905	0.3553397278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9796577	1.567341	1	0.9402164!sample_table_end
