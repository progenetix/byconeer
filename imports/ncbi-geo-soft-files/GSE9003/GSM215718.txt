Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	AB	0.4830519	0.8349133	1.446151	0.6606492	0.5626922142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9870205	0.7752797	1	0.65628684234	NC	0.08462442	0.7184987	1.330756	0.7157473	-0.2017057252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9929336	0.5612087	1	-0.420047922860	AA	0.8808271	0.004228265	0.7405301	0	0.634759198390	AA	0.8797263	0.01613604	1.71996	0	0.2666073138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9832233	1.339141	0.9978324	0.799900181607	AA	0.784545	0.08518948	0.3636467	0.01189334	-0.3882548146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9561068	1.644198	1	0.2137901156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9927408	2.030982	1	0.24487586178	AA	0.8811052	0.03658906	1.296966	0	0.9404221260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9864008	1.654726	1	0.3511604128978	NC	0.09547096	0.8199161	0.9905663	0.7252658	0.002013765156724	NC	0.0805176	0.3875512	2.210366	0.3204715	0.56976571283	NC	0	0.4909741	1.49386	0.3405897	0.526041144671	AA	0.8078112	0.003192015	3.012418	0	0.1178052240130	NC	0.06634384	0.3174915	1.844645	0.2529621	0.5853197239834	NC	0.05939086	0.1693793	2.997791	0.2274616	0.6936482248222	NC	0	0.4494142	0.5089663	0.2896905	0.5280647278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9887734	1.262363	1	0.6183606!sample_table_end
