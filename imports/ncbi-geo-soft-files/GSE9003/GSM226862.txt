Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	NC	0	0.4778165	1.251556	0.2943765	0.6080535142066	AB	0.636718	0.7241058	0.8119378	0.6893059	0.763980184234	BB	0.8676848	0.9958305	1.11492	1	-0.2364527252381	AA	0.8262474	0.03782762	0.3787075	0	-0.84491822860	AA	0.8808271	0.008302306	0.5919866	0	0.310416398390	AA	0.8797263	0.01129559	1.548313	0	0.1149909138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9854918	1.450337	1	0.914260981607	AA	0.7251894	0.1367196	0.1749863	0.07373032	-1.42197146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9656025	1.532865	1	0.1161861156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9941412	2.163363	1	0.33774976178	AB	0.6741433	0.7221699	1.166841	0.6614044	0.6483105260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9841985	1.753087	1	0.432063128978	NC	0.0003929695	0.8662459	1.046494	0.801055	0.08018205156724	NC	0	0.3066286	2.405463	0.2500487	0.7162841283	BB	0.8091115	1	1.475673	1	0.325818944671	AA	0.8078112	0.001699444	3.062873	0	0.1412581240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9824963	1.525375	1	0.5736064239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9901578	1.766631	1	0.8664532248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9850194	0.5186751	0.9914566	0.2313796278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9855487	1.175657	1	0.5191115!sample_table_end
