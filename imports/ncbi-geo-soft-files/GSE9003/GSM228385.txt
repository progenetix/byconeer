Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM700991!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804320!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804321!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	NC	0	0.3261848	1.876497	0.1858279	1.307776142066	NC	0.1019235	0.7814311	0.9437594	0.7588314	0.971981384234	NC	0.03012304	0.1972112	1.514201	0.1829325	-0.1844783252381	NC	0.02922622	0.8762645	0.5051426	0.8427874	-0.59056422860	AA	0.8808271	0.005532332	0.7679647	0	0.686808898390	AA	0.8797263	0.01361297	2.069621	0	0.5336305138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9866042	1.625458	1	1.07836681607	AA	0.784545	0.1082556	0.2658309	0.03957305	-0.8306635146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9573268	1.7697	1	0.3203661156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9952851	2.366348	1	0.46858826178	NC	0.06085237	0.7838606	1.170673	0.7473789	0.6639499260311	NC	0.003101664	0.1703535	3.487301	0.1482073	0.7664222128978	BB	0.850426	0.991252	1.155522	1	0.2202812156724	BB	0.9236776	0.9950648	2.112562	0.9982915	0.64448091283	BB	0.8091115	0.9966474	1.8788	0.9985352	0.675077444671	AA	0.8078112	0.003140639	3.520334	0	0.3425783240130	NC	0.011072	0.752426	2.276289	0.7180843	1.050684239834	NC	0	0.5463701	2.829463	0.6531756	1.067258248222	AA	0.8508317	0.0745867	0.4655041	0	0.5954499278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9753121	1.537718	1	0.9173179!sample_table_end
