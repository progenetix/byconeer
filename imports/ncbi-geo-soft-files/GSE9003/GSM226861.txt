Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.8183162	0.9958069	2.323198	1	1.121829142066	AB	0.4412251	0.395371	1.232881	0.3329665	1.4365784234	BB	0.8676848	0.9966348	1.262753	1	-0.05613018252381	AB	0.8262474	0.6196875	0.6448963	0.474756	-0.266048722860	AA	0.8808271	0.007474139	1.160124	0	1.28133398390	AA	0.8797048	0.01522687	2.659787	0	0.895554138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9726381	1.79523	0.9789683	1.22612581607	AA	0.784545	0.0905287	0.6313857	0.01830049	0.4099503146488	AB	0.5928496	0.545884	3.248622	0.4573319	1.074908156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9939597	3.088633	1	0.8512126178	AB	0.5793674	0.4832442	1.914843	0.384332	1.375739260311	BB	0.6059937	0.9696445	2.803531	0.9877779	1.093633128978	AB	0.850426	0.645825	1.07878	0.4709377	0.1455332156724	NC	0.0748304	0.457672	3.731381	0.3814939	1.3043011283	BB	0.8091115	0.9992479	2.034588	1	0.789366544671	AA	0.8078112	0.002397032	5.327807	0	0.9401532240130	BB	0.8931652	0.9730099	2.26097	0.988509	1.137102239834	BB	0.3984587	0.9874761	2.578234	1	1.408409248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9756098	0.641732	0.9747494	0.5449582278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9893196	1.824649	1	1.149275!sample_table_end
