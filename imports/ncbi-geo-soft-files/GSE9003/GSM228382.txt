Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9984418	1.803635	1	0.7546694142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9932729	0.9631066	1	0.968302784234	AB	0.8676848	0.476029	1.728541	0.4651214	0.02723952252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9844907	0.6619282	1	-0.183269722860	AB	0.7991453	0.5450101	0.8967413	0.4360286	0.742024298390	AB	0.8797263	0.4717376	2.216575	0.4637682	0.6267766138233	NC	0.009549663	0.5125829	1.963568	0.3495827	1.54882481607	AA	0.784545	0.08485693	0.3926979	0.01149428	-0.2775106146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9693432	2.13378	1	0.5947675156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9908987	2.479372	0.9985537	0.53034116178	AB	0.8807282	0.5297087	1.572483	0.4279875	1.078987260311	BB	0.7576621	0.9826075	2.627861	1	1.014321128978	BB	0.850426	0.9898081	1.171091	1	0.2396229156724	AB	0.886844	0.5280653	3.069386	0.4427535	1.0018721283	BB	0.7904181	0.9997685	2.479908	1	1.07478944671	AA	0.8078112	0.002602823	3.769914	0	0.4412134240130	NC	0	0.4411618	2.446225	0.371818	1.034617239834	NC	0	0.219919	4.069575	0.3021487	1.208532248222	NC	0.06741457	0.5524101	0.4974593	0.3733844	0.4455355278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9928678	1.5021	1	0.8648942!sample_table_end
