Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,AB, or NC (no call#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for siganl intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.996582	1.77221	1	0.730691142066	AB	0.9026175	0.5225619	1.042674	0.4560215	1.16148784234	BB	0.8676848	0.9939439	1.280948	1	-0.03780198252381	AB	0.8262474	0.6259562	0.7122965	0.4806245	-0.124546222860	AA	0.8808271	0.005258769	0.9186403	0	0.945359598390	AA	0.8797263	0.01292484	2.22193	0	0.6360858138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9808914	1.594391	0.9936767	1.05233881607	AA	0.784545	0.1023571	0.3196528	0.03249479	-0.5671328146488	AB	0.8135715	0.5618078	1.99148	0.4717988	0.3661014156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9888507	2.275704	0.9965393	0.40409076178	BB	0.8811052	0.9681941	1.214376	1	0.7499213260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9765662	2.115331	0.9943177	0.6947536128978	BB	0.850426	0.993806	1.249499	1	0.3330278156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01228864	2.565338	0	0.90186981283	BB	0.8091115	1	1.881923	1	0.676653944671	AA	0.8078112	0.002148776	3.616132	0	0.3809736240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9793198	1.855119	0.9962447	0.8545184239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9870628	1.903512	1	0.9701621248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9859696	0.6454673	0.9931437	0.546244278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9878994	1.663176	1	1.017098!sample_table_end
