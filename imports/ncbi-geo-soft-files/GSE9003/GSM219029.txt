Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804324!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804325!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9967446	1.810264	1	0.7612211142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9872333	1.162088	1	1.24018484234	BB	0.8676848	0.9948499	1.455563	1	0.1473417252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9868025	0.6922394	1	-0.118301322860	AA	0.8808271	0.005331988	1.171341	0	1.29592598390	AA	0.8797263	0.01526707	2.341813	0	0.7118686138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9835365	1.850452	0.9983905	1.2663781607	AA	0.784545	0.07501303	0.60935	0	0.3522549146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9519832	2.37381	1	0.7420714156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9892147	2.445468	0.9968974	0.50834826178	BB	0.8811052	0.9614748	1.446668	0.9949092	1.001221260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9782909	2.344932	0.9959472	0.8452868128978	BB	0.850426	0.9545138	1.389248	0.9454492	0.4868874156724	AB	0.9158824	0.4921558	2.785764	0.4115034	0.87250191283	BB	0.8091115	0.9993963	2.118249	1	0.84746644671	AA	0.8078112	0.00283993	3.611757	0	0.3794639240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9788948	1.941911	0.9957237	0.9202922239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9754906	2.05511	0.9945131	1.066025248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9872319	0.7621298	0.9953849	0.7850754278305	NC	0.1681159	0.6803439	1.551545	0.4384513	1.220887!sample_table_end
