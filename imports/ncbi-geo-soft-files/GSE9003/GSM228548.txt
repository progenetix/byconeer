Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9927823	1.181686	1	0.1488129142066	AA	0.9026175	0.0243253	0.8142046	0	0.939901584234	BB	0.8676848	0.9944384	0.9429874	1	-0.4792787252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9839321	0.3659294	1	-1.03846922860	AA	0.8808271	0.005219185	0.5072616	0	0.0886025598390	AA	0.8797263	0.008969139	1.38188	0	-0.04904488138233	AA	0.8618885	0.03559003	1.12145	0	1.04236681607	NC	0.01880217	0.2059023	0.09494554	0.1567506	-2.274549146488	AA	0.8135715	0.02492622	1.174119	0	-0.2979031156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9957507	2.233675	1	0.38593646178	AA	0.8811052	0.04317901	0.8801994	0	0.3792299260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9866461	1.721117	1	0.408181128978	BB	0.850426	0.9815276	0.8677954	0.9896401	-0.1926126156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01766615	1.893832	0	0.46228061283	BB	0.8091115	1	1.396489	1	0.246249844671	AA	0.8078112	0.001133968	3.20406	0	0.2060801240130	BB	0.8949394	0.983276	1.40463	1	0.4549849239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9857682	1.579646	1	0.699449248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9736185	0.3402869	0.9712138	-0.368895278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9870178	1.215394	1	0.5655139!sample_table_end
