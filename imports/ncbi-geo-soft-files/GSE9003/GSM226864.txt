Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9939048	1.744266	1	0.7097511142066	BB	0.9026175	0.994739	0.9697131	1	0.977939784234	BB	0.8676848	0.9892876	1.357022	0.9966116	0.04143888252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9857928	0.6973575	1	-0.107836422860	AA	0.8808271	0.007302539	0.8204333	0	0.781568898390	AA	0.8797263	0.01220212	2.195629	0	0.6189163138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9902164	1.684226	1	1.12845981607	AA	0.7812223	0.1260628	0.1887656	0.06094201	-1.317106146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9681521	1.780924	1	0.3335364156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9892331	2.336478	0.9969155	0.44259596178	BB	0.8811052	0.9656364	1.257188	1	0.7994426260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9788967	2.207187	0.9965196	0.7586071128978	BB	0.850426	0.9902231	1.219544	1	0.2981021156724	AA	0.918875	0.0172078	2.63832	0	0.94074051283	BB	0.8091115	0.9980112	1.992931	1	0.759824644671	AA	0.8078112	0.00282422	3.94726	0	0.5076091240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9749855	1.78854	0.990931	0.7998334239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9865364	1.983689	1	1.029013248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9751065	0.5916874	0.9738558	0.4281678278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9829586	1.447089	1	0.8215441!sample_table_end
