Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9954721	1.578556	1	0.5645719142066	BB	0.9026175	0.982349	0.7985241	1	0.699624384234	BB	0.8676848	0.9936612	1.245926	1	-0.07803784252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9828116	0.6302052	1	-0.25439322860	AA	0.8808271	0.003619868	0.8886249	0	0.897976998390	AA	0.8797263	0.01913574	1.895722	0	0.406941138233	AA	0.8618885	0.04578828	1.353577	0	1.30662281607	AA	0.784545	0.08825221	0.46355	0.01556867	-0.0367937146488	AA	0.8135715	0.02407792	2.085064	0	0.5307706156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9914066	2.231397	0.9990532	0.37895626178	BB	0.8811052	0.9624539	1.127194	0.9962737	0.6414260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9794561	1.923266	0.9970481	0.5605637128978	BB	0.850426	0.9952612	1.0015	1	0.01380624156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01601816	2.055221	0	0.5808011283	BB	0.8091115	0.9956092	1.688244	0.9967073	0.521043244671	AA	0.8078112	0.002335032	3.03533	0	0.1284435240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9803638	1.563673	0.9975246	0.6084178239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9816541	1.486379	0.9994158	0.6064162248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9921027	0.7241786	1	0.708066278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9868352	1.432244	1	0.8025595!sample_table_end
