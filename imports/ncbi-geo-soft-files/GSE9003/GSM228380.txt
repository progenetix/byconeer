Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	NC	0.01412923	0.8688568	1.718565	0.7387046	0.784446142066	NC	0	0.245298	1.216618	0.1877736	1.45776584234	BB	0.8676848	0.9921312	1.593809	0.999561	0.2759105252381	AA	0.8262474	0.03363276	0.4254821	0	-0.675445922860	AA	0.8808271	0.009207419	0.9483551	8.645662E-05	0.989979598390	AA	0.8797263	0.01178421	2.599433	0	0.8624845138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9786364	1.623005	0.9896579	1.07871781607	AA	0.784545	0.1103372	0.3961754	0.04207102	-0.2541614146488	AA	0.8135715	0.02044876	2.422711	0	0.7479885156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9905603	2.670617	0.9982209	0.63711136178	BB	0.8811052	0.9549591	1.405848	0.9858286	0.9587451260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9771043	2.376006	0.9948261	0.8629921128978	BB	0.850426	0.9866997	1.338287	0.998101	0.4322291156724	NC	0.07595297	0.01176554	3.366131	0	1.2939831283	BB	0.6953384	0.9784414	2.621277	0.9664794	1.15999744671	AA	0.8078112	0.00165095	4.996705	0	0.8473328240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9674246	1.938648	0.9816617	0.9126947239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9751835	2.115276	0.9942688	1.107268248222	BB	0.8508317	0.978177	0.5848733	0.9793075	0.4093518278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9840548	1.544214	1	0.9141004!sample_table_end
