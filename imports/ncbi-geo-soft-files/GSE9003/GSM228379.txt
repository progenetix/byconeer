Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9988129	1.643046	1	0.6198596142066	AA	0.9026175	0.03355159	1.080445	0	1.3454484234	BB	0.8676848	0.995564	1.385852	1	0.07715052252381	AA	0.8262474	0.0376875	0.5379763	0	-0.338410622860	AA	0.8808271	0.008991035	0.9590834	0	1.0062898390	AA	0.8797263	0.0131937	2.193022	0	0.6171893138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9825307	1.587192	0.996598	1.04528981607	BB	0.7836199	0.8781938	0.1463536	0.9334602	-1.201765146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9459386	1.748227	1	0.2985066156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9919353	2.227754	0.9995732	0.37726796178	BB	0.8811052	0.9536899	1.288111	0.9840599	0.8323318260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9779682	1.909721	0.9956422	0.5487519128978	BB	0.850426	0.9812985	1.214457	0.9892654	0.2922767156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01342096	2.339549	0	0.76858281283	BB	0.8091115	0.9792397	1.980378	0.9678849	0.755307444671	BB	0.700358	0.9327894	2.235017	0.9548301	0.4749781240130	BB	0.8949394	0.967567	1.591475	0.9818363	0.6280729239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9789091	1.838814	0.9972323	0.9099094248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9880267	0.6339781	0.9967962	0.5189298278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9874777	1.186904	1	0.5308059!sample_table_end
