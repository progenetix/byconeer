Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	AB	0.2573324	0.6854668	1.606802	0.443027	0.8241153142066	AB	0.9026175	0.483741	1.010545	0.418463	1.12642784234	BB	0.8676848	0.9946716	1.248316	1	-0.07440604252381	AB	0.6756566	0.5519649	0.5248069	0.411357	-0.54255122860	AA	0.8808271	0.01021603	0.6893724	0.0009070902	0.529501998390	AA	0.8797263	0.0136987	2.052688	0	0.5217772138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9792669	1.578534	0.9907817	1.03843581607	AA	0.784545	0.105858	0.2822328	0.03669593	-0.7452893146488	BB	0.8135715	0.96613	1.632022	1	0.2068136156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9886326	2.219794	0.9963248	0.36792826178	BB	0.8811052	0.9614298	1.072337	0.9948464	0.569236260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9763082	2.146387	0.9940739	0.715501128978	BB	0.850426	0.996376	1.145005	1	0.2069722156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01240843	2.431804	0	0.82470921283	BB	0.8091115	0.9794993	1.672632	0.9683419	0.51158844671	AA	0.8078112	0.002994577	2.791743	0	0.007982014240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9774773	1.464294	0.9939858	0.5123799239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9721365	1.938348	0.9918451	0.9774085248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9844425	0.5743686	0.9904322	0.3789194278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9834422	1.255745	1	0.616421!sample_table_end
