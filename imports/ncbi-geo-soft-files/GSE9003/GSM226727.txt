Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9912326	1.298914	1	0.2864257142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9895539	0.6028954	1	0.293086984234	BB	0.8676848	0.9900209	0.9460142	0.9973722	-0.4784432252381	AA	0.8262474	0.03776227	0.3296819	0	-1.04490422860	AA	0.8808271	0.007347897	0.5048662	0	0.0810686998390	AA	0.8797263	0.01330655	1.475642	0	0.0456105138233	BB	0.8618885	0.990249	1.181713	1	0.617243981607	AA	0.784545	0.09810456	0.2127586	0.02739164	-1.156196146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9551107	1.601495	1	0.1754536156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9960495	1.868506	1	0.12878196178	BB	0.8811052	0.9638532	0.8260741	0.9982238	0.1932612260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9783384	1.705943	0.9959921	0.3863613128978	BB	0.850426	0.9921591	0.8684795	1	-0.1917206156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01408454	1.76272	0	0.359941283	BB	0.8091115	0.9979318	1.461148	1	0.312054544671	AA	0.8078112	0.001655579	2.985637	0	0.1043964240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9841834	1.316518	1	0.3619325239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9832551	1.422642	1	0.5452211248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9914816	0.4168807	1	-0.08822233278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9786516	1.14022	1	0.4822803!sample_table_end
