Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.996446	1.642961	1	0.6215414142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9934026	0.8910297	1	0.856060784234	AB	0.8676848	0.525409	1.306904	0.5154732	-0.363601252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9841853	0.5922052	1	-0.343896522860	AB	0.407987	0.5200385	0.860669	0.4157111	0.690168598390	AB	0.8797263	0.4552964	2.093839	0.4460392	0.5448037138233	AB	0.4589618	0.5893393	1.793639	0.4099381	1.37508581607	AA	0.784545	0.1041658	0.3942129	0.03466523	-0.2639075146488	NC	0.1187885	0.4960931	2.326724	0.4120965	0.6022336156630	BB	0.8742581	0.992028	2.131605	0.9996644	0.31373576178	BB	0.8811052	0.9582306	1.228907	0.9903879	0.7652735260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9763081	2.265611	0.9940738	0.793491128978	BB	0.850426	0.9779911	1.084783	0.9838549	0.1294479156724	AA	0.8308965	0.0123	2.824005	0	1.040461283	BB	0.8091115	0.9989921	1.795462	1	0.609047844671	AB	0.8078112	0.3541044	3.237741	0.4778341	0.347349240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9773462	1.721481	0.9938251	0.7457662239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9854345	2.030782	1	1.061458248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9824209	0.6446873	0.9868429	0.5469233278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9835573	1.445622	1	0.8194454!sample_table_end
