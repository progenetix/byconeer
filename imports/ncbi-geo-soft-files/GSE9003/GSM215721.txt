Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype  metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9968324	1.655011	1	0.6317969142066	AB	0.8314216	0.4373262	1.080083	0.3735574	1.23459684234	BB	0.8676848	0.9920394	1.307025	0.9994658	-0.01036096252381	AB	0.8253623	0.5796111	0.5020297	0.4372381	-0.615083322860	AA	0.8808271	0.004259992	0.8373528	0	0.812025898390	AA	0.8797263	0.0123749	1.956025	0	0.4522046138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9881904	1.575246	1	1.03259481607	AA	0.784545	0.1164439	0.2599963	0.04939915	-0.8592504146488	AB	0.8135715	0.5940067	1.875209	0.5016642	0.2742253156630	BB	0.8742581	0.99411	2.488163	1	0.53951546178	AB	0.3145235	0.4652239	1.497195	0.3674011	1.025679260311	BB	0.7870646	0.977432	2.058097	0.9951357	0.6561201128978	BB	0.850426	1	1.141884	1	0.2029506156724	AA	0.9028793	0.01181674	2.703351	0	0.97762381283	BB	0.8091115	0.9992632	1.855913	1	0.656755344671	AB	0.8078112	0.3356836	3.47321	0.4526633	0.4417656240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9870365	1.65049	1	0.6893908239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9907373	1.83645	1	0.9231131248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9948318	0.5356265	1	0.2710919278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9897876	1.509259	1	0.8750027!sample_table_end
