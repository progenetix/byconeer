Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9957348	1.304311	1	0.2890591142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9779697	0.6737347	0.9971976	0.455143484234	BB	0.8676848	0.9962708	1.091592	1	-0.2665812252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9813914	0.3935962	0.9997317	-0.933726622860	AA	0.8808271	0.008824214	0.5671183	0	0.248328898390	AA	0.8797263	0.01344034	1.530743	0	0.09849817138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9878805	1.136608	1	0.561849581607	AA	0.784545	0.08419548	0.2366788	0.01070053	-1.008275146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9632742	1.5963	1	0.1738166156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9944331	2.031727	1	0.24755076178	BB	0.8811052	0.9589878	0.8775433	0.9914432	0.2795774260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9865014	1.766417	1	0.4455032128978	BB	0.850426	0.9957177	0.9258029	1	-0.0995894156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01356561	2.051108	0	0.57870921283	BB	0.8091115	0.9997997	1.660182	1	0.495836744671	AA	0.8078112	0.001910837	2.788512	0	0.005940498240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9884086	1.575057	1	0.6225221239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9872554	1.554567	1	0.6782564248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9922498	0.4158142	1	-0.09244073278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9669259	1.141103	1	0.4959331!sample_table_end
