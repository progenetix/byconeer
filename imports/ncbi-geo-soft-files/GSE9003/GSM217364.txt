Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9961947	1.604201	1	0.587284142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9877573	0.9029327	1	0.876074284234	BB	0.8676848	0.9930635	1.459175	1	0.1493841252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9930566	0.4903116	1	-0.614866422860	AA	0.8808271	0.006187848	0.9022245	0	0.919038298390	AA	0.8797263	0.01098579	2.455324	0	0.7802111138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9814007	1.866427	0.9945844	1.2794581607	AA	0.784545	0.07119136	0.3520696	0	-0.4407387146488	NC	0	0.4083512	2.532101	0.3323822	0.7400037156630	BB	0.8742581	0.989933	2.611045	0.9976039	0.60377236178	BB	0.8811052	0.9533246	1.404702	0.9835507	0.9572725260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9760083	2.240196	0.9937906	0.7768911128978	AA	0.850426	0.02696022	1.168249	0	0.5909097156724	BB	0.9236776	0.992888	2.406603	0.9955881	0.83131841283	BB	0.8091115	0.9953058	2.329373	0.9961731	0.985536244671	AA	0.8078112	0.002588973	4.015815	0	0.5323697240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9847236	1.82219	1	0.8311234239834	BB	0.7002718	0.990027	2.006208	1	1.049756248222	AB	0.8508317	0.7740658	0.4015557	0.6169003	0.01388399278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9857694	1.393428	1	0.7640494!sample_table_end
