Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.8178563	0.9933339	2.325302	1	1.124974142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9781705	0.9565776	0.9974411	0.960813884234	AB	0.2748264	0.3538906	0.8759495	0.3415063	-0.9625085252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9539849	0.4176904	0.9588163	-0.852410722860	AA	0.8808271	0.008223126	0.8523076	0	0.83625298390	NC	0.03540186	0.670449	2.186583	0.6745054	0.7069079138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9753892	1.827584	0.983871	1.25101981607	AA	0.784545	0.07377439	0.5299832	0	0.1504171146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9520258	2.524127	1	0.8306671156630	NC	0.2404111	0.9963664	3.893025	1	1.1881916178	AA	0.8803868	0.06628589	1.903369	0	1.485053260311	BB	0.4077418	0.9836562	2.939352	1	1.177073128978	NC	0	0.4886014	0.822024	0.3453615	-0.1695674156724	NC	0.0608915	0.6540599	3.810792	0.5747812	1.3233461283	BB	0.8091115	0.9794194	2.128855	0.9682013	0.859565144671	NC	0.1047408	0.195023	5.352599	0.2604596	1.014362240130	NC	0.2087038	0.9607741	2.832658	0.9735086	1.456811239834	NC	0.01445237	0.9649907	3.273468	0.9861611	1.724431248222	BB	0.8508317	0.975062	0.5156685	0.9737767	0.2298068278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9821668	1.74259	1	1.090464!sample_table_end
