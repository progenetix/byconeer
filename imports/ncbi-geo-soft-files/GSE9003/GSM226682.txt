Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	AA	0.825021	0.03922628	1.722861	0	1.431964142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9924764	0.8602796	1	0.805535384234	AB	0.8676848	0.583023	1.949295	0.5752308	0.2523977252381	NC	0.02451674	0.4181226	0.711247	0.2860595	-0.0620205322860	NC	0	0.4407441	0.9616239	0.3511952	0.873862698390	NC	0.05230021	0.3493144	2.195247	0.3317559	0.614381138233	AB	0.8618885	0.6734331	1.749307	0.4760632	1.2931481607	AA	0.784545	0.09777356	0.3142406	0.02699444	-0.5936823146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9559344	1.957435	1	0.4653055156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9873777	2.189741	0.9950905	0.34667926178	BB	0.8811052	0.9639211	1.305043	0.9983185	0.8530276260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9821597	2.291933	0.9996025	0.8165098128978	NC	0.07984458	0.5408957	1.347789	0.3871295	0.5176888156724	AB	0.9169958	0.5517306	2.966724	0.4633482	0.94590941283	BB	0.8091115	0.9789974	2.126642	0.9674583	0.858168144671	AB	0.8078112	0.4080699	3.305905	0.5305212	0.4193033240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9716785	1.779821	0.9868768	0.791292239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9721444	2.027354	0.9918514	1.042189248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9943132	0.6700504	1	0.5944868278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9843928	1.510439	1	0.8818373!sample_table_end
