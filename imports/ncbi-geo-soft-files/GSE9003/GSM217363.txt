Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9967903	1.482716	1	0.4732293142066	BB	0.9026175	0.989722	0.8016471	1	0.704120684234	AB	0.2575617	0.6890233	1.662839	0.6851751	0.09812152252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9921868	0.6542042	1	-0.198964422860	NC	0	0.3210332	0.8940563	0.2537955	0.805258198390	NC	0	0.3015706	2.048871	0.2802726	0.5154323138233	AB	0.8561631	0.776302	1.419706	0.6290742	0.951415581607	AA	0.784545	0.07544945	0.3916391	0.0002051648	-0.2853107146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9622815	1.773599	1	0.3253932156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9910403	2.109655	0.9986929	0.29755266178	BB	0.8811052	0.9677795	1.112164	1	0.623001260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9802998	1.962031	0.9978452	0.5902702128978	BB	0.850426	0.9749666	1.081878	0.9789072	0.1256496156724	BB	0.9236776	0.9934412	1.944771	0.996275	0.52421671283	BB	0.8091115	0.9951814	1.746103	0.9959542	0.569763744671	AA	0.8078112	0.001971434	2.881823	0	0.05344716240130	AB	0.8907608	0.6417366	1.978161	0.5823847	0.8022183239834	AB	0.5418693	0.4232777	2.74488	0.5552635	0.9146809248222	AB	0.8508317	0.7621233	0.613771	0.595696	0.635071278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9866299	1.626827	1	0.9865611!sample_table_end
