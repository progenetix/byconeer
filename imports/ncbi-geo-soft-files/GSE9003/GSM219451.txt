Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM700990!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804330!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804331!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	AA	0.825021	0.03919967	1.470558	0	1.203546142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9824713	0.9407405	1	0.936066284234	AB	0.3082944	0.6841028	1.415313	0.6800715	-0.137977252381	NC	0.03104371	0.4088192	0.5070454	0.27735	-0.547293422860	NC	0	0.3386641	0.8255354	0.2681404	0.684788198390	NC	0.004209874	0.2934759	2.11338	0.2715438	0.5602584138233	AB	0.8618885	0.7411708	1.864466	0.5664664	1.35631881607	AA	0.7613096	0.1315786	0.1668363	0.067561	-1.492946146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9747837	1.875781	1	0.4108872156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9919319	2.538649	0.99957	0.56573466178	NC	0	0.3260019	1.476717	0.2365957	1.044274260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9807328	2.051828	0.9982544	0.6553026128978	AB	0.8107746	0.7601888	1.148061	0.6275601	0.2162681156724	NC	0.007451324	0.3303082	2.862233	0.2706559	0.95990151283	BB	0.8091115	1	1.980489	1	0.75030344671	AA	0.8078112	0.00305621	3.884004	0	0.4843817240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9864835	1.693169	1	0.725972239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9892812	2.135841	1	1.139135248222	AB	0.8294455	0.7877153	0.4703252	0.6411356	0.2316269278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9781731	1.425186	1	0.8046275!sample_table_end
