Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9946996	1.601943	1	0.5863634142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9871579	0.8399144	1	0.771790384234	BB	0.8676848	0.9921653	1.337045	0.9995963	0.02250847252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9879317	0.588817	1	-0.351571322860	AA	0.8808271	0.007600412	0.7115504	0	0.576049998390	AA	0.8797263	0.01262746	1.976502	0	0.467226138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9844661	1.436084	1	0.900337881607	AA	0.784545	0.1073449	0.2960685	0.03848013	-0.6756223146488	AB	0.8135715	0.5502923	2.107863	0.461337	0.4500805156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9910107	2.359163	0.9986639	0.45878276178	AB	0.8782372	0.5261869	1.359752	0.4246786	0.8702354260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9821979	2.253028	0.9996386	0.7918514128978	BB	0.850426	0.9939069	1.163167	1	0.2297333156724	AB	0.9236776	0.5390978	2.687755	0.4523545	0.80711011283	AB	0.6375825	0.608643	2.175669	0.424881	1.00884644671	AB	0.8078112	0.3851204	3.017128	0.5119632	0.2655461240130	AB	0.3664743	0.4605297	2.009955	0.3904319	0.7579268239834	NC	0	0.2509429	3.337858	0.3479958	0.9698932248222	AB	0.4722439	0.593437	0.5041214	0.4067227	0.4454599278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9831129	1.481869	1	0.8556443!sample_table_end
