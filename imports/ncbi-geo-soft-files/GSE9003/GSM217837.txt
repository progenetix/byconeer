Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9926031	1.649685	1	0.6302894142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9949589	0.8319458	1	0.756837584234	AA	0.8676848	0.01201557	1.384963	0	-0.3267869252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9877515	0.5030314	1	-0.578771122860	BB	0.8808271	0.9798698	0.7830031	0.9926525	0.326188998390	BB	0.8797263	0.9911165	1.530532	1	0.4093488138233	AA	0.8618885	0.03847034	1.612723	0	1.56447581607	AA	0.784545	0.07604736	0.3747706	0.0009226649	-0.3485797146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9701988	1.944372	1	0.4609813156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9899903	2.2532	0.9976602	0.39119276178	BB	0.8811052	0.9638966	1.199858	0.9982842	0.7317896260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9793012	2.025117	0.9969017	0.6348426128978	BB	0.850426	0.9959311	1.053077	1	0.08624012156724	BB	0.9236776	0.9977781	2.171441	1	0.68559661283	BB	0.8091115	0.9970219	1.816494	0.9991946	0.626331244671	AA	0.8078112	0.002041162	3.228388	0	0.2173032240130	AA	0.8949394	0.03010996	2.338157	0	0.8340521239834	AA	0.7002718	0.01264466	4.104695	0	0.9392967248222	AA	0.8508317	0.07352667	0.4341319	0	0.4953841278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9910517	1.487404	1	0.852625!sample_table_end
