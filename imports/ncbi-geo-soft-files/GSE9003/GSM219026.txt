Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9921908	1.37872	1	0.3717357142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9844207	0.6982884	1	0.505792384234	BB	0.8676848	0.9924924	1.027352	0.9999356	-0.3573283252381	BB	0.8262474	0.981954	0.4807891	1	-0.644948422860	AA	0.8808271	0.009254165	0.5021181	0.0001244902	0.0725634998390	AA	0.8797263	0.014627	1.534352	0	0.1018809138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9856973	1.246876	1	0.696125181607	AA	0.5915631	0.147287	0.194495	0.08641138	-1.265013146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9535156	1.598329	1	0.1720035156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9937038	1.94188	1	0.18137336178	AA	0.8811052	0.04589935	0.9868661	0	0.543448260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9838478	1.572647	1	0.2749783128978	BB	0.850426	0.9933416	0.8264451	1	-0.2633207156724	BB	0.9236776	0.9921866	1.715441	0.9947169	0.34252391283	BB	0.8091115	0.9951218	1.465119	0.9958492	0.316656844671	AA	0.8078112	0.003267056	2.956317	0	0.09071001240130	AA	0.8949394	0.04202408	1.692247	0	0.3713709239834	AA	0.7002718	0.01466008	3.062267	0	0.5191115248222	AA	0.8508317	0.07023191	0.3786539	0	0.2999794278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9822432	1.226096	1	0.5832221!sample_table_end
