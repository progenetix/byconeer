Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	1	1.813316	1	0.7612368142066	BB	0.9026175	0.991831	1.132679	1	1.20249584234	BB	0.8676848	0.9922422	1.562786	0.9996761	0.2476465252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9834816	0.7635705	1	0.0226546922860	AA	0.8808271	0.008254511	1.023165	0	1.09983498390	AA	0.8797263	0.01365993	2.347524	0	0.7154034138233	BB	0.8455505	0.9800106	2.071127	0.9921069	1.43002981607	AA	0.784545	0.1193786	0.2513518	0.05292078	-0.9068022146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9620411	1.98081	1	0.4847137156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9912989	2.42044	0.9989473	0.49614196178	BB	0.8811052	0.9612671	1.435631	0.9946197	0.9901333260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9783033	2.272035	0.9959589	0.7997391128978	BB	0.850426	0.991602	1.251626	1	0.335532156724	NC	0.0885634	0.01442642	3.336757	0	1.2804721283	BB	0.8091115	0.9806962	2.242854	0.9704494	0.934510344671	AA	0.8078112	0.003155711	3.536672	0	0.3492634240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9727271	1.958514	0.9881623	0.9297919239834	BB	0.6770927	0.9703206	2.286325	0.9904007	1.213326248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9904838	0.7987784	1	0.8506179278305	NC	0.03188089	0.6566033	1.637256	0.4200465	1.310657!sample_table_end
