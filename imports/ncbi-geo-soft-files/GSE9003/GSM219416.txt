Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9935188	1.571445	1	0.5595095142066	AA	0.9026175	0.02458539	1.009635	0	1.25019884234	AB	0.8676848	0.4883996	1.480902	0.4776416	-0.1949128252381	AB	0.8262474	0.6161838	0.6020149	0.471476	-0.364248922860	AB	0.3559147	0.5173134	0.807699	0.4134938	0.599335198390	AB	0.8734127	0.4341548	2.00471	0.4232417	0.4823147138233	AB	0.5527126	0.5951366	1.520321	0.4144967	1.13336581607	AA	0.784545	0.07161012	0.4056378	0	-0.236234146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9492506	1.920418	1	0.4352685156630	BB	0.8742581	0.990936	2.21996	0.9985904	0.37094746178	AB	0.5646146	0.4822044	1.354092	0.3833551	0.8761205260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9793362	1.906149	0.9969348	0.5475358128978	BB	0.850426	0.9923871	1.081264	1	0.124429156724	AB	0.9236776	0.5171388	2.347939	0.4332448	0.61850571283	AB	0.8091115	0.649482	1.975924	0.4541357	0.849788944671	BB	0.8078112	0.991272	2.09619	1	0.471559240130	AB	0.6071948	0.4735948	2.005878	0.4029884	0.7595367239834	NC	0	0.2610761	2.959618	0.3629705	0.8121786248222	AB	0.7892367	0.6204473	0.6166217	0.4286712	0.7235278278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9818153	1.333085	1	0.7043729!sample_table_end
