Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	NC	0	0.4837919	1.747772	0.2986541	1.085483142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9904578	0.9219182	1	0.90567984234	NC	0.069902	0.7243537	1.475551	0.7218202	-0.04837406252381	NC	0.04714855	0.3912428	0.5456063	0.2608957	-0.435933522860	NC	0	0.3619	0.8006805	0.2870457	0.633553898390	NC	0.01141055	0.2827183	2.270682	0.2599436	0.6639684138233	AB	0.8618885	0.7579786	1.747406	0.5964199	1.25714581607	AA	0.784545	0.093277	0.4051216	0.0215985	-0.2290716146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9554787	1.806778	1	0.3495909156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9921419	2.318797	0.9997765	0.43531656178	BB	0.8811052	0.959266	1.27514	0.9918309	0.8187414260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9783138	2.269848	0.9959688	0.798361128978	BB	0.850426	0.9870458	1.153145	0.9986672	0.2174071156724	NC	0	0.3237642	2.871799	0.264961	0.96670391283	BB	0.8091115	0.9820044	1.882792	0.9727528	0.681726844671	AA	0.8078112	0.002315181	3.461692	0	0.3180605240130	AB	0.8949394	0.6202411	2.205019	0.5560324	0.9500951239834	NC	0.2218319	0.441247	3.047405	0.569557	1.080899248222	AB	0.8187352	0.7904567	0.7644824	0.646003	0.9303885278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9850453	1.596271	1	0.9608836!sample_table_end
