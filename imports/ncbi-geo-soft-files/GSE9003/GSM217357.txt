Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9950722	1.419044	1	0.411183142066	AB	0.9026175	0.5444413	0.8940014	0.4771894	0.933889984234	BB	0.8676848	0.9942537	1.267369	1	-0.05291064252381	AB	0.8262474	0.670558	0.6847912	0.5356877	-0.183930822860	AA	0.8808271	0.006849486	0.7998622	0	0.745084198390	AA	0.8797263	0.01619424	1.68558	0	0.2374762138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9827411	1.348072	0.9969731	0.809643281607	AA	0.784545	0.1004013	0.3633735	0.03014775	-0.3830021146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9592274	1.769931	1	0.3212643156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9925076	2.072997	1	0.27412116178	NC	0.06231827	0.4294674	1.40446	0.3338062	0.9432138260311	AB	0.7870646	0.445921	2.777678	0.4907331	0.604764128978	BB	0.850426	0.9961378	1.137871	1	0.1979609156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01441452	2.136255	0	0.63711291283	BB	0.8091115	0.9993957	1.864982	1	0.663755744671	AB	0.8078112	0.2980936	3.046749	0.401299	0.2388573240130	BB	0.8949394	0.98199	1.507319	0.9995182	0.5561987239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9835575	1.531027	1	0.6515334248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9886043	0.666615	0.9978217	0.5909568278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9775146	1.2601	1	0.6277168!sample_table_end
