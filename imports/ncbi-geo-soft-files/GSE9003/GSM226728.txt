Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9949661	1.594278	1	0.5792454142066	AA	0.9026175	0.023395	0.9611651	0	1.17955984234	BB	0.8676848	0.9940032	0.9643719	1	-0.4473013252381	AA	0.8262474	0.03646231	0.29301	0	-1.21457822860	AA	0.8808271	0.008332298	0.5709821	0	0.258287398390	AA	0.8797263	0.01155544	1.592674	0	0.1557408138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9842144	1.482945	0.9995986	0.946743181607	AA	0.7798245	0.1267133	0.1714799	0.06172258	-1.455388146488	AA	0.8135715	0.01813112	1.616657	0	0.1648187156630	BB	0.8742581	0.994977	2.575779	1	0.59054376178	BB	0.8811052	0.9496821	0.9555665	0.9784744	0.4007764260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9860993	1.975835	1	0.6067011128978	BB	0.850426	0.9768234	1.012972	0.9819448	0.03066333156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01319944	2.547589	0	0.89155731283	BB	0.8091115	0.9924433	1.728528	0.9911329	0.555839244671	BB	0.8078112	0.9906506	2.10854	1	0.4790574240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9819903	1.62393	0.9995185	0.6637032239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9878958	2.073166	1	1.094397248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9941519	0.3423565	1	-0.374174278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9797994	1.292193	1	0.6615676!sample_table_end
