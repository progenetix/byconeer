Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9916811	1.810079	1	0.7648384142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9890118	0.9236884	1	0.908668984234	NC	0.1617198	0.7006367	1.416993	0.6972207	-0.1242322252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9817844	0.5707173	1	-0.397603622860	NC	0	0.3662538	0.7463297	0.2905881	0.530807998390	NC	0.008125831	0.2827273	2.291296	0.2599533	0.6770065138233	AB	0.8618885	0.751232	1.802521	0.5843965	1.30420281607	AA	0.784545	0.1015046	0.2470522	0.03147178	-0.9391785146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9681924	1.922499	1	0.4439079156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9934557	2.504405	1	0.54807226178	BB	0.8811052	0.955986	1.342098	0.9872598	0.8919809260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9828635	2.257403	1	0.7953751128978	AB	0.8357847	0.7541317	1.22438	0.6176516	0.3092599156724	NC	0	0.3024865	3.330172	0.2464441	1.1868311283	BB	0.8091115	1	1.856601	1	0.657109444671	AA	0.8078112	0.002460591	3.954224	0	0.5100276240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9878668	1.705081	1	0.7367126239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9897753	1.889959	1	0.9633179248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9852062	0.623945	0.9917883	0.4978398278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9744724	1.372165	1	0.7538775!sample_table_end
