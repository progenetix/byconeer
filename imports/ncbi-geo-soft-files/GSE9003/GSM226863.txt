Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9926862	1.380894	1	0.3736399142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9884511	0.6832524	1	0.473767684234	BB	0.8676848	0.9916205	1.117592	0.9990312	-0.2366125252381	AA	0.8262474	0.0361298	0.4301049	0	-0.660723622860	AA	0.8808271	0.006372069	0.5899825	0	0.306162798390	AA	0.8797263	0.01149904	1.602381	0	0.1645081138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9872539	1.298728	1	0.754413181607	BB	0.784545	0.8941205	0.1250918	0.9513333	-1.413401146488	AA	0.8135715	0.02068392	1.628895	0	0.1752149156630	AA	0.8742581	0.004096344	2.83875	0	0.18238196178	BB	0.8811052	0.9656584	1.006264	1	0.4782543260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9823272	1.836853	0.9997607	0.497363128978	BB	0.850426	0.9722526	1.064348	0.9744675	0.1021439156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01239414	2.051325	0	0.57924291283	BB	0.8091115	1	1.670483	1	0.504711544671	BB	0.8078112	0.9919983	1.724128	1	0.1907984240130	BB	0.8949394	0.983727	1.440977	1	0.4920459239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9846625	1.47894	1	0.6030024248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9879208	0.5303265	0.996608	0.26145278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9892043	1.122018	1	0.4478734!sample_table_end
