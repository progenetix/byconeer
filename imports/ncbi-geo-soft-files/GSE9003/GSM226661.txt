Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	AA	0.825021	0.04939874	1.098401	0	0.7730263142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9924664	0.8356519	1	0.763633384234	AA	0.8676848	0.01534415	1.449214	0	-0.2611207252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9857089	0.4490078	1	-0.743007722860	BB	0.8808271	0.9886525	0.6958454	1	0.15140198390	BB	0.8797263	0.991381	1.322313	1	0.1985722138233	AA	0.8618885	0.04155706	1.390485	0	1.34839881607	BB	0.7638834	0.8702098	0.1512577	0.9245004	-1.161594146488	AA	0.8135715	0.02194327	1.808248	0	0.3256759156630	AA	0.8742581	0.004778059	3.314947	0	0.40613016178	BB	0.8811052	0.9456064	1.17309	0.9727943	0.6959237260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9826728	1.867068	1	0.5212774128978	BB	0.850426	0.9650419	1.106128	0.9626719	0.1578585156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01280623	2.318301	0	0.75562041283	BB	0.8091115	1	1.632635	1	0.471648544671	AA	0.8078112	0.002484278	3.177197	0	0.1943955240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9820042	1.451331	0.9995356	0.5015963239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9887888	1.754282	1	0.8545821248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9739501	0.5155652	0.9718026	0.2302809278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9861658	1.395448	1	0.7657194!sample_table_end
