Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9924561	1.538648	1	0.5298719142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9899219	0.9061933	1	0.880941484234	BB	0.8676848	0.9885588	1.266438	0.9958557	-0.05885226252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9834652	0.602987	1	-0.317982522860	AA	0.8808271	0.009143783	0.6806518	3.468055E-05	0.511490398390	AA	0.8797263	0.01126384	2.086997	0	0.5457222138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9854659	1.550411	1	1.01053181607	AA	0.7790581	0.1270285	0.1991852	0.06210076	-1.239185146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9628434	1.648193	1	0.2198084156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9927868	2.23334	1	0.38195956178	BB	0.8811052	0.944313	1.079818	0.9709918	0.5761643260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9812201	1.518308	0.9987147	0.2213873128978	NC	0	0.4185916	1.220155	0.2894439	0.4359232156724	AB	0.9236776	0.6658738	2.616683	0.5894534	0.78662971283	BB	0.8091115	0.9984344	1.893204	1	0.685658644671	AB	0.2709889	0.529245	2.873242	0.6285082	0.3383563240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9762418	1.61306	0.9924712	0.651417239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9846715	1.769691	1	0.8619479248222	BB	0.8508317	0.988745	0.6080713	0.9980714	0.4582477278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9860933	1.416919	1	0.7878255!sample_table_end
