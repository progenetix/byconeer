Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9937239	1.601834	1	0.5869902142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9838133	0.9927151	1	1.01344384234	BB	0.8676848	0.9928625	1.511029	1	0.1995894252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9882427	0.7776656	1	0.049809322860	AA	0.8808271	0.006543584	1.070941	0	1.16624198390	AA	0.8797263	0.01305337	2.369005	0	0.7285525138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9821442	1.530027	0.9959094	0.99249281607	AA	0.784545	0.0866512	0.377012	0.01364743	-0.3355743146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9471635	2.073962	1	0.5454598156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9881598	2.327168	0.9958599	0.43548126178	BB	0.8811052	0.9599477	1.392431	0.9927809	0.9458157260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9738883	2.078196	0.9917876	0.666303128978	BB	0.850426	0.9947961	1.192484	1	0.2656242156724	BB	0.9236776	0.992905	1.991831	0.9956091	0.55842441283	AB	0.6279463	0.6221237	2.569675	0.4345378	1.24229844671	AB	0.8078112	0.2898941	4.159207	0.3900949	0.6848791240130	AB	0.8949394	0.517683	2.281312	0.4453604	0.9605913239834	NC	0	0.2797734	3.428584	0.3906012	1.053991248222	AB	0.8508317	0.6420862	0.7522559	0.4462548	1.000392278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9774968	1.44937	1	0.8296232!sample_table_end
