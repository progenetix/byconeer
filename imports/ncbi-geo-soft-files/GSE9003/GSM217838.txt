Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9943583	1.699169	1	0.6716229142066	AB	0.9026175	0.4886678	1.017854	0.4232295	1.13553884234	BB	0.8676848	0.9925767	1.236035	1	-0.09046672252381	AB	0.8262474	0.6169963	0.4908749	0.4722366	-0.658940422860	AA	0.8808271	0.006807507	0.8611653	0	0.851636798390	AA	0.8797263	0.0140043	2.184762	0	0.611735138233	AB	0.5904625	0.5976068	1.778699	0.4164391	1.35844681607	AB	0.784545	0.4429754	0.3142229	0.441242	-0.4420419146488	AA	0.8135715	0.01891011	1.977647	0	0.4554426156630	AB	0.8742581	0.4999901	3.880864	0.5157128	0.66026926178	AB	0.7055587	0.4933324	1.453111	0.3938103	0.974919260311	BB	0.7870646	0.980266	2.085404	0.9978133	0.6782125128978	BB	0.850426	0.975867	1.139181	0.9803802	0.2000873156724	AB	0.9236776	0.526953	2.799103	0.4417855	0.86921041283	AB	0.793548	0.632241	1.777279	0.4417852	0.705393644671	AA	0.8078112	0.0005613324	5.31319	0	0.935561240130	NC	0.008840227	0.4537002	2.36866	0.3838683	0.9924674239834	NC	0	0.25558	3.708227	0.3548484	1.128908248222	NC	0.03031404	0.5330627	0.677636	0.3576629	0.9006442278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9857929	1.58109	1	0.9463058!sample_table_end
