Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM700989!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804326!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804327!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9981005	1.68501	1	0.6567717142066	AB	0.9026175	0.4884222	1.096074	0.422992	1.24241784234	BB	0.8676848	0.9938133	1.420733	1	0.1115097252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9915053	0.587831	1	-0.353413822860	AA	0.8808271	0.007316328	0.8265941	0	0.792357298390	AA	0.8797263	0.01222315	2.400977	0	0.747903138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9806945	1.580914	0.9933258	1.04015481607	AA	0.784545	0.092362	0.2589026	0.02050048	-0.8753981146488	AB	0.8130497	0.5462586	2.175625	0.4576723	0.4964441156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9876351	2.2335	0.9953437	0.37554996178	AB	0.8700135	0.5209348	1.441145	0.419744	0.9555232260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9844891	2.38814	1	0.8783695128978	BB	0.850426	0.9706582	1.193158	0.9718593	0.2669961156724	AB	0.9236776	0.5076348	2.830871	0.4249739	0.89113631283	BB	0.8091115	0.9994626	1.966711	1	0.740362544671	AA	0.8078112	0.004504705	3.414762	0.0001285866	0.2991179240130	AB	0.8587836	0.496962	2.206006	0.425446	0.9048939239834	NC	0	0.2650295	3.761347	0.3688128	1.164228248222	NC	0.1130688	0.5636437	0.524316	0.3825128	0.5160919278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9863685	1.498092	1	0.8679028!sample_table_end
