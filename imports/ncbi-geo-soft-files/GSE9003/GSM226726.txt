Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	AA	0.825021	0.04554525	1.299229	0	1.018882142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9946381	0.8194875	1	0.73511984234	AA	0.8676848	0.009733495	1.347126	0	-0.3669162252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9878175	0.5660096	1	-0.408582422860	AA	0.8808271	0.007215891	0.6654087	0	0.479452198390	BB	0.8797263	0.9919595	1.309018	1	0.1844169138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9844428	1.425555	1	0.889728781607	BB	0.784545	0.8875851	0.1137846	0.9439992	-1.55619146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9647151	1.586645	1	0.1656026156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9971442	2.147486	1	0.33093726178	AA	0.8811052	0.03423944	1.089119	0	0.6891403260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9802958	1.931579	0.9978415	0.5676988128978	BB	0.850426	0.9913214	1.05142	1	0.0840741156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01436561	2.03705	0	0.56852651283	BB	0.8091115	1	1.648387	1	0.485500844671	AA	0.8078112	0.002771319	2.563423	0	-0.1151888240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9814796	1.632219	0.9988924	0.6708179239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9873308	1.658792	1	0.7719728248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9889469	0.4572623	0.99843	0.04689152278305	BB	0.6793056	0.986783	1.31948	1	0.6843076!sample_table_end
