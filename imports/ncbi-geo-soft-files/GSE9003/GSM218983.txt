Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9997052	1.311891	1	0.2944723142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9892582	0.7355604	1	0.580068584234	AA	0.8605489	0.01240616	1.183937	0	-0.5530139252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9846226	0.4311091	1	-0.8018722860	BB	0.8808271	0.9861979	0.5818695	1	-0.105403598390	BB	0.8797263	0.98202	1.33043	1	0.2005775138233	AA	0.8618885	0.03825708	1.430656	0	1.39180381607	AA	0.784545	0.106003	0.192897	0.03686989	-1.294284146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9639271	1.494617	1	0.07910491156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9937081	2.244554	1	0.39035366178	BB	0.8811052	0.9686834	1.087864	1	0.5912939260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9849342	2.026455	1	0.6419252128978	BB	0.850426	0.9794173	0.934561	0.986188	-0.08563013156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01053613	2.415371	0	0.81553651283	BB	0.8091115	0.9873199	1.714462	0.982112	0.545306344671	AA	0.8078112	0.002502945	3.343502	0	0.2680076240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9766256	1.448069	0.9929417	0.4959205239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9788277	1.815987	0.9971675	0.8917843248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9865831	0.5179895	0.9942329	0.2284041278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9802324	1.320736	1	0.6926283!sample_table_end
