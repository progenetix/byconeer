Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9951048	1.536406	1	0.5257988142066	AA	0.9026175	0.02985392	0.9540499	0	1.16700284234	BB	0.8676848	0.9947808	1.09688	1	-0.260889252381	AA	0.8262474	0.03196682	0.4052679	0	-0.745089322860	AA	0.8808271	0.006711012	0.5458603	0	0.193910298390	AA	0.8797263	0.01225171	1.693073	0	0.2439254138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9870964	1.358502	1	0.819379581607	BB	0.784545	0.8838096	0.1212116	0.9397623	-1.468482146488	AA	0.8135715	0.0254772	1.427003	0	-0.01659771156630	AA	0.8742581	0.004899385	3.123857	0	0.32047596178	BB	0.8811052	0.9567662	1.034134	0.9883471	0.5160552260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9880518	1.695177	1	0.3878073128978	BB	0.850426	0.9927804	0.963317	1	-0.04221613156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01216709	2.312627	0	0.75229341283	BB	0.8091115	0.9977193	1.690181	1	0.522181444671	AA	0.8078112	0.001632652	3.452483	0	0.3139837240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9840937	1.444457	1	0.4956926239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9888609	1.676293	1	0.7890681248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9825851	0.4958397	0.9871343	0.1680853278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9896835	1.225799	1	0.5749941!sample_table_end
