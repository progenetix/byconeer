Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9931762	1.648348	1	0.6286935142066	AB	0.8828373	0.4526203	1.048595	0.3883542	1.18789384234	BB	0.8676848	0.9912212	1.358464	0.9986172	0.04462814252381	BB	0.8262474	0.975131	0.6279899	0.9903855	-0.260708222860	AA	0.8808271	0.01416673	0.8704419	0.004121471	0.864660198390	AA	0.8797263	0.01128928	2.154215	0	0.5914559138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9802464	1.527935	0.9925272	0.991120781607	AA	0.784545	0.09480959	0.2864663	0.02343763	-0.7284225146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9552243	1.998109	1	0.4947115156630	BB	0.8742581	0.989596	2.247291	0.9972724	0.38690626178	AB	0.3590373	0.4683827	1.581201	0.370369	1.103577260311	BB	0.7870646	0.977224	1.898252	0.9949391	0.5392552128978	BB	0.850426	0.9788116	1.252105	0.9851971	0.3363781156724	AA	0.9219996	0.01603194	2.612678	0	0.92703251283	BB	0.8091115	0.9986107	2.103176	1	0.837355744671	AA	0.8078112	0.002394135	3.607464	0	0.3775953240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9829494	1.778059	1	0.7949505239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9871728	2.038192	1	1.068928248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9865625	0.6338268	0.9941964	0.519584278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9805225	1.378414	1	0.7539872!sample_table_end
