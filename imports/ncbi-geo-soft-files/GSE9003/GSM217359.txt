Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	AA	0.825021	0.04614359	1.351876	0	1.075629142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9905283	0.7335837	1	0.57599184234	AA	0.8676848	0.01235226	1.414225	0	-0.2965983252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9923129	0.6151981	1	-0.28763422860	AA	0.8808271	0.005089224	0.8122866	0	0.767904398390	AA	0.8797263	0.01762302	1.671431	0	0.2252968138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9829563	1.329784	0.9973567	0.789868881607	AA	0.784545	0.09569337	0.4061756	0.02449818	-0.2243159146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9463751	1.789224	1	0.3321109156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9914362	2.02034	0.9990824	0.23564466178	AB	0.8638282	0.6943645	1.184677	0.6226537	0.6653067260311	NC	0.148577	0.255772	3.09117	0.2543811	0.6420713128978	NC	0.1215712	0.8152901	1.190912	0.7176983	0.2678617156724	BB	0.9236776	0.9920181	1.606631	0.9945077	0.24789281283	BB	0.8091115	0.9907982	1.6376	0.9882365	0.478281444671	AB	0.4095891	0.5166927	2.920985	0.6183578	0.3490692240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9850735	1.541676	1	0.5901076239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9870217	1.468165	1	0.5954596248222	BB	0.8508317	0.98778	0.6408869	0.996358	0.5347348278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9784334	1.265943	1	0.6334124!sample_table_end
