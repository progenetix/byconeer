Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9704796	1.249051	0.972393	0.2454876142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9639192	0.4902428	0.9801568	-0.00137474884234	AB	0.8676848	0.5860925	1.483446	0.5784146	-0.1394842252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9747727	0.5757489	0.9898506	-0.386067622860	AB	0.8808271	0.6285725	0.5009015	0.5068277	-0.124051498390	AB	0.8797263	0.5006025	1.239395	0.494894	-0.2122856138233	AB	0.8618885	0.6992227	0.9557544	0.4963422	0.407297381607	AA	0.7820798	0.1255922	0.27858	0.06037722	-0.7558074146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9438105	1.749599	1	0.2988467156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9847963	1.970934	0.9925516	0.19154626178	AB	0.8811052	0.5902571	0.5774695	0.4848755	-0.3824579260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9886256	1.357067	1	0.06749089128978	BB	0.842849	0.9432755	1.053027	0.9270648	0.08738493156724	AA	0.9236776	0.02013076	1.178211	0.0007247015	-0.22323131283	BB	0.8091115	0.9957806	1.342929	0.9970092	0.190861144671	AA	0.8078112	0.006184483	2.955968	0.002423895	0.09153926240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9626544	1.272137	0.9758137	0.3027536239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9616648	0.9556009	0.9835156	-0.05606447248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9688078	0.3505162	0.9626722	-0.3228593278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9605125	0.9141879	1	0.1829699!sample_table_end
