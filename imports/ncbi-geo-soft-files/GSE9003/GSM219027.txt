Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM700982!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804338!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804339!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9994128	1.4849	1	0.4734076142066	AB	0.8011035	0.7043998	0.8410034	0.665406	0.817846384234	BB	0.8676848	0.9944998	1.353711	1	0.0423835252381	BB	0.8262474	0.991572	0.6804326	1	-0.142352322860	AA	0.8808271	0.005987256	0.8414438	0	0.818485198390	AA	0.8797263	0.01334406	1.946417	0	0.4450883138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9845039	1.453436	1	0.917652981607	AA	0.784545	0.09542259	0.3165163	0.02417324	-0.5842528146488	NC	0.03357567	0.7096646	2.092067	0.6679178	0.4721368156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9949491	2.147283	1	0.32801146178	AB	0.8530833	0.6978447	1.263776	0.6275039	0.7591655260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9793407	2.020472	0.9969391	0.6315722128978	BB	0.850426	0.9955662	1.212139	1	0.2891917156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01252676	2.523039	0	0.87780611283	NC	0	0.4050251	2.089733	0.2790208	1.05546644671	AA	0.8078112	0.003784223	3.06115	0	0.14116240130	NC	0.05009441	0.3284778	1.962442	0.2635207	0.6783163239834	NC	0.05316811	0.1721497	3.090344	0.2315556	0.7414701248222	NC	0	0.3952059	0.6034051	0.2456411	0.8003935278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9814678	1.275966	1	0.6415629!sample_table_end
