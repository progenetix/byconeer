Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9960643	1.780065	1	0.7374564142066	AA	0.9026175	0.02410871	1.482518	0	1.80454984234	BB	0.8676848	0.9941306	1.58216	1	0.2670417252381	AB	0.7880982	0.7270963	0.6836798	0.6200938	-0.177457522860	AA	0.8808271	0.007674577	0.9210538	0	0.948344998390	AA	0.8797263	0.01434626	2.602328	0	0.8640575138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9817314	1.837859	0.9951736	1.25709281607	AA	0.784545	0.07757885	0.5026231	0.002760476	0.07552443146488	AA	0.8135715	0.02174516	2.502411	0	0.7944396156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9894098	2.814847	0.9970893	0.71154056178	BB	0.8811052	0.9550885	1.436353	0.9860089	0.9897383260311	BB	0.7752274	0.9753191	2.582114	0.9931394	0.9810722128978	BB	0.850426	0.9898592	1.344571	1	0.4389142156724	AA	0.4220016	0.01407509	3.072474	0	1.1615411283	BB	0.8091115	0.9983535	2.177155	1	0.887292644671	AA	0.8078112	0.002320122	3.941576	0	0.5053575240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9843796	1.81503	1	0.8252874239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9880764	2.136318	1	1.137918248222	BB	0.8508317	0.991144	0.6104747	1	0.4623045278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9826911	1.492961	1	0.8668503!sample_table_end
