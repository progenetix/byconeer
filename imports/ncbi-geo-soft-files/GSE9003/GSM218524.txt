Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	NC	0.1131201	0.9970986	2.953913	1	1.467386142066	AB	0.5909886	0.4077972	1.236479	0.3449887	1.43748384234	BB	0.8389915	0.9838318	0.826415	0.9909528	-0.6787288252381	AB	0.8262474	0.5920593	0.5712116	0.4488916	-0.432649822860	AA	0.8808271	0.004841752	1.03835	0	1.12221998390	NC	0.1238179	0.01684628	3.360411	0	1.232861138233	NC	0.243026	0.5752748	1.587386	0.3988788	1.2066681607	NC	0	0.277205	1.889791	0.2423149	2.071473146488	NC	0.036447	0.5126898	3.853002	0.4271747	1.32696156630	NC	0	0.9912996	4.350415	0.998948	1.3420266178	BB	0.8811052	0.9813427	1.748927	1	1.278566260311	BB	0.2772156	0.9645145	3.026497	0.982931	1.198517128978	AB	0.850426	0.6337328	0.7442634	0.4612795	-0.3842008156724	NC	0	0.4258303	4.844328	0.3537837	1.6903361283	BB	0.8091115	0.9936415	1.87492	0.9932427	0.672830644671	NC	0	0.3113301	6.989537	0.4193858	1.441666240130	BB	0.7941554	0.9699076	2.471878	0.9847057	1.26437239834	NC	0.1898288	0.9768752	2.749157	0.9956145	1.487549248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9905741	0.8856425	1	0.9994856278305	NC	0	0.6378634	2.019071	0.4055184	1.622769!sample_table_end
