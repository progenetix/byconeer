Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,AB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotpye metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9932863	1.822964	1	0.7738769142066	AA	0.9026175	0.02486668	1.32286	0	1.63994584234	BB	0.8676848	0.9949262	1.336239	1	0.02400832252381	AB	0.8251705	0.5793564	0.8035558	0.4369997	0.0636204822860	AA	0.8808271	0.00513113	1.127013	0	1.24033598390	AA	0.8797263	0.01583185	2.328363	0	0.7035517138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9847287	1.596518	1	1.05304481607	AA	0.784545	0.08075248	0.5760763	0.006568877	0.2736244146488	NC	0.05936963	0.4856179	2.566436	0.4025797	0.7455697156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9900544	2.32725	0.9977233	0.43792476178	BB	0.8811052	0.9725926	1.42032	1	0.9767217260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9772744	2.168202	0.9949868	0.7311372128978	BB	0.850426	0.9967086	1.171425	1	0.2398757156724	AB	0.9190862	0.4948922	2.573865	0.4138846	0.7575621283	BB	0.8091115	0.9990214	2.096308	1	0.832536244671	AA	0.8078112	0.003081113	3.93486	0	0.5031576240130	NC	0	0.4401154	2.377464	0.3708123	0.9931223239834	NC	0	0.2446128	3.325798	0.3386411	0.9548897248222	AB	0.7266241	0.6125532	0.6550267	0.4222564	0.8143515278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9813805	1.552889	1	0.9250209!sample_table_end
