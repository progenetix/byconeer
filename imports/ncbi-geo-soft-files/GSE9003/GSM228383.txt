Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9941778	1.668761	1	0.6457053142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9863507	0.848479	1	0.786551284234	BB	0.8676848	0.9944541	1.277267	1	-0.04151523252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9760565	0.5844938	0.9917672	-0.364113322860	AA	0.8808271	0.00392073	0.8461459	0	0.827209198390	AA	0.8797263	0.01131625	2.398485	0	0.7464166138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9858353	1.445322	1	0.909154181607	AA	0.784545	0.1056933	0.4291367	0.0364983	-0.1408067146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9588857	1.881697	1	0.4094781156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9927286	2.102603	1	0.29485956178	BB	0.8811052	0.9606858	1.365117	0.9938096	0.9173681260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9778501	2.176578	0.9955308	0.7373239128978	BB	0.850426	0.9767538	1.138249	0.9818309	0.1988869156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01191192	2.42385	0	0.8201441283	AB	0.6992301	0.6151139	2.061984	0.4295164	0.928212544671	AA	0.8078112	0.003376377	3.136248	0	0.1759862240130	AB	0.4876877	0.4670161	2.194075	0.3966659	0.8866281239834	NC	0	0.2665711	3.52824	0.3710909	1.074356248222	NC	0.1325286	0.5668063	0.5837125	0.3850827	0.6694244278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9815995	1.363406	1	0.737048!sample_table_end
