Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM700981!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804316!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804317!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9975842	1.730585	1	0.6956576142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9922331	1.140751	1	1.2126884234	BB	0.8676848	0.9906744	1.491304	0.9980499	0.1787575252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9959912	0.713253	1	-0.0736787222860	AA	0.8808271	0.003929174	1.093551	0	1.19724998390	AA	0.8797263	0.01285503	2.519669	0	0.8175079138233	BB	0.8618885	0.980166	1.89156	0.992384	1.2991481607	AB	0.784545	0.4552076	0.2899323	0.4559208	-0.5524337146488	AB	0.7918953	0.5391892	2.428054	0.4512497	0.6560681156630	AB	0.8742581	0.4368193	3.792227	0.4501365	0.61162316178	BB	0.8811052	0.9605341	1.362432	0.9935982	0.9145005260311	BB	0.7860118	0.9771285	2.525301	0.994849	0.9509354128978	BB	0.850426	0.9822665	1.331707	0.9908488	0.4252198156724	AA	0.5976545	0.01395981	2.986361	0	1.1205661283	BB	0.8091115	1	2.097163	1	0.83288544671	AB	0.8078112	0.3521766	3.355182	0.4752	0.3980325240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9867178	1.857733	1	0.8598955239834	BB	0.7002718	0.990698	1.901592	1	0.9733514248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9778345	0.6455557	0.9786995	0.552004278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9908315	1.46275	1	0.828744!sample_table_end
