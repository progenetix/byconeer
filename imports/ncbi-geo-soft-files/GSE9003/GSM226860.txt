Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9996099	1.822309	1	0.7686632142066	AA	0.9026175	0.02760701	1.236107	0	1.54130984234	BB	0.8676848	0.9917931	1.50655	0.9992103	0.1943902252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9626009	0.4243864	0.9716793	-0.828084122860	AA	0.8808271	0.004765	0.8800092	0	0.883541598390	AA	0.8797263	0.01347557	1.995331	0	0.4808937138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9848369	1.9283	1	1.3254181607	AA	0.784545	0.05960996	0.1729618	0	-1.470933146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9818065	1.916291	1	0.4443499156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9901764	2.738004	0.9978433	0.67257756178	BB	0.8811052	0.9597045	1.292026	0.992442	0.8377999260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9816679	2.416923	0.9991378	0.8925813128978	BB	0.850426	0.9834939	1.144899	0.9928567	0.2071355156724	BB	0.9060925	0.9989097	2.669244	1	0.98398291283	AA	0.6345586	0.01319028	2.35878	0	1.45608444671	BB	0.8078112	0.9896828	2.345736	1	0.6313348240130	AA	0.8848289	0.02893083	2.589687	0	0.9810874239834	AA	0.6476188	0.01243355	4.438929	0	1.051973248222	AA	0.8508317	0.03955683	0.2814292	0	-0.1107998278305	BB	0.6793056	0.986481	1.321575	1	0.6869162!sample_table_end
