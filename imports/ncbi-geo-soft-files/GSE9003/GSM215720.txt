Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	1	1.665178	1	0.6382824142066	NC	0	0.2021527	1.016193	0.1460312	1.20987684234	BB	0.8676848	0.9950606	1.153273	1	-0.1883205252381	AA	0.7076293	0.2734809	0.5518751	0.1506521	-0.381261122860	AA	0.8808271	0.009317509	0.7416853	0.0001760283	0.63532398390	AA	0.8797263	0.0125445	1.931675	0	0.43413138233	BB	0.8618885	0.985441	1.439603	1	0.903559981607	AA	0.784545	0.0946713	0.2602887	0.02327168	-0.8667326146488	NC	0	0.2677619	2.041674	0.2046557	0.4549976156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9898119	2.287131	0.9974847	0.41253126178	BB	0.8811052	0.9620468	1.139152	0.9957063	0.6565501260311	NC	0	0.7532176	2.594713	0.7832946	0.7656852128978	BB	0.850426	0.9781837	1.045317	0.98417	0.07597828156724	NC	0	0.2155956	2.667902	0.1708275	0.89372971283	NC	0.02920975	0.8922679	1.747643	0.8147503	0.596445144671	AA	0.8078112	0.001603154	3.499792	0	0.3336088240130	BB	0.8949394	0.987285	1.668489	1	0.7051516239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9892176	1.801034	1	0.8930755248222	NC	0.007481144	0.8823589	0.6235384	0.8091789	0.5688784278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9868517	1.584999	1	0.9487469!sample_table_end
