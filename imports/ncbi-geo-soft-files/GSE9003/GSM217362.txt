Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	NC	0	0.5452881	2.09083	0.3426773	1.299881142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9845805	0.9773511	1	0.990821784234	AB	0.8620312	0.4092279	2.087964	0.3975127	0.2947903252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9823058	0.8508897	1	0.178676322860	AA	0.8808271	0.006305472	0.9605787	0	1.00941798390	AB	0.8797263	0.5438817	2.229289	0.540737	0.6573809138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9789248	1.708547	0.990172	1.15272781607	AA	0.784545	0.08868569	0.6102505	0.01608886	0.3600632146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9521341	2.058291	1	0.5363704156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9902518	2.270329	0.9979174	0.40244946178	NC	0.01389035	0.3936702	1.874565	0.3001731	1.369613260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9765734	2.125694	0.9943245	0.7018117128978	NC	0	0.4919377	1.674162	0.3480263	0.8549407156724	AB	0.9236776	0.561789	2.618693	0.4721015	0.76296981283	BB	0.8091115	1	2.080981	1	0.821709744671	AA	0.8078112	0.003442095	3.411442	0	0.2973507240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9873049	1.632146	1	0.6733882239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9875457	1.788286	1	0.8806916248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9906057	0.8232487	1	0.8940679278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9797459	1.665539	1	1.027793!sample_table_end
