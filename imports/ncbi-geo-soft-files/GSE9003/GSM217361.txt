Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9979541	1.766405	1	0.7249393142066	AB	0.9026175	0.4799004	1.164831	0.4147473	1.33241684234	AB	0.8676848	0.4752391	1.624279	0.464322	-0.06257518252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9903204	0.692928	1	-0.116300522860	NC	0.2044494	0.5081303	1.03179	0.4060222	0.955319398390	AB	0.8235176	0.4211794	2.097633	0.4092499	0.5478481138233	NC	0.1987573	0.5717591	1.960455	0.3961144	1.51315581607	AA	0.784545	0.1018443	0.3647972	0.03187935	-0.376758146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9520994	1.908758	1	0.4275444156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9952059	2.408915	1	0.49420886178	AB	0.369439	0.4690992	1.653837	0.3710421	1.168177260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9801767	2.181596	0.9977289	0.7431725128978	BB	0.850426	0.9877707	1.338921	0.999853	0.4328875156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01437268	2.516298	0	0.87334561283	BB	0.8091115	1	1.829953	1	0.636252644671	AA	0.8078112	0.002265948	3.293565	0	0.2462164240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9850587	1.772249	1	0.7911824239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9864988	1.880501	1	0.9518956248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9836815	0.7132159	0.9890811	0.6918012278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9866298	1.632381	1	0.9914779!sample_table_end
