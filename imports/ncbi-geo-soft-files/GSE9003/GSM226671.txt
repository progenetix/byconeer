Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM700988!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804334!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804335!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	AB	0.825021	0.7949035	1.738385	0.5686442	0.8609957142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9857204	1.004162	1	1.0296984234	BB	0.8676848	0.9933141	1.436129	1	0.1266311252381	AB	0.2552694	0.7708021	0.6407365	0.6853425	-0.264194522860	AA	0.8808271	0.003846776	1.112193	0	1.22166298390	AA	0.8797263	0.01237894	2.270058	0	0.6670089138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9849029	1.841214	1	1.25871781607	AA	0.784545	0.1066914	0.2960065	0.03769603	-0.6761976146488	NC	0.04171642	0.7059919	2.435325	0.6626385	0.6900333156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9894471	2.091219	0.997126	0.2828756178	BB	0.8811052	0.9591861	1.404451	0.9917196	0.9580774260311	NC	0	0.232636	3.995836	0.2256234	0.9988103128978	AB	0.5268075	0.7856794	1.452071	0.6692593	0.5545912156724	NC	0.01025844	0.3334914	2.968091	0.2734261	1.0113291283	BB	0.8091115	0.9986744	2.107559	1	0.840343244671	BB	0.8078112	0.9899527	1.949436	1	0.3647741240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9831119	1.69879	1	0.7292284239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9853678	1.888252	1	0.9563888248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9838769	0.8404577	0.989428	0.928504278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9796503	1.506508	1	0.8831131!sample_table_end
