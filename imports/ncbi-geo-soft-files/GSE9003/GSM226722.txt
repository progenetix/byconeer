Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9995409	1.73107	1	0.6946109142066	AB	0.9026175	0.4881402	1.213327	0.4227191	1.38911484234	BB	0.8676848	0.9951689	1.355723	1	0.04510081252381	AB	0.8262474	0.5852342	0.5459862	0.4425022	-0.49571822860	AA	0.8808271	0.0163833	0.8627857	0.005924924	0.851181998390	AA	0.8797263	0.01870512	1.237816	0	-0.2080041138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9770495	1.773447	0.9868299	1.20710981607	AA	0.784545	0.1216076	0.2789428	0.05559565	-0.7556047146488	AB	0.2565508	0.5061637	2.426277	0.4212457	0.6608829156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9888785	2.534145	0.9965667	0.55931216178	AB	0.879984	0.528254	1.652596	0.4266207	1.151068260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9800696	2.139745	0.9976278	0.7151107128978	AB	0.8482358	0.6162841	1.324852	0.4473431	0.4561301156724	AB	0.5162281	0.4551014	3.258073	0.3792569	1.1093711283	BB	0.8091115	0.9749566	2.000316	0.9603434	0.770811144671	AA	0.8078112	0.002399414	4.030311	0	0.5375032240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9704049	2.134742	0.9853154	1.053048239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9746934	2.133892	0.993879	1.119291248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9924493	0.7013282	1	0.6615744278305	BB	0.6793056	0.987032	1.372709	1	0.7410999!sample_table_end
