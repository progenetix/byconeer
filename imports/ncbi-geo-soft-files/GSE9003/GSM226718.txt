Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9967313	1.733688	1	0.6988749142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9897009	0.884697	1	0.8463484234	BB	0.8676848	0.9890547	1.206196	0.99637	-0.1287394252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9743118	0.5499474	0.9891624	-0.452287622860	AA	0.8808271	0.01155246	0.9462284	0.001994441	0.98596598390	AA	0.8797263	0.01251637	2.304746	0	0.6888855138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9812154	1.568275	0.994254	1.02840881607	AA	0.784545	0.1000358	0.3305117	0.02970916	-0.5199062146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9615963	1.98726	1	0.4892374156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9925222	2.387583	1	0.47797256178	BB	0.8811052	0.956365	1.384836	0.987788	0.9372749260311	AB	0.774919	0.3587351	3.487773	0.3823625	0.8783807128978	BB	0.850426	0.9893956	1.062861	1	0.09973279156724	AB	0.679252	0.4493466	2.856818	0.3742487	0.9214651283	AB	0.8091115	0.6712484	1.875141	0.4697279	0.763647144671	AB	0.8078112	0.326467	4.168742	0.4400694	0.7016853240130	NC	0.2025274	0.4501614	2.178937	0.3804673	0.8707957239834	NC	0	0.2682926	3.334103	0.373635	0.9954229248222	AB	0.8508317	0.6637911	0.5088536	0.4638921	0.4264847278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9833966	1.363508	1	0.7352489!sample_table_end
