Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	NC	0	0.6393875	1.618407	0.4100402	0.865318142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9923919	0.9086699	1	0.884499184234	AB	0.8676848	0.5390378	1.524523	0.529609	-0.1322199252381	AB	0.8262474	0.5969306	0.6778473	0.453452	-0.187206722860	NC	0.08822601	0.4941964	0.9135478	0.3946853	0.783864898390	AB	0.5521681	0.397953	2.147563	0.3842042	0.5820811138233	AB	0.3784785	0.584423	1.804635	0.4060723	1.38662981607	AA	0.784545	0.09383076	0.5554983	0.02226302	0.2265867146488	NC	0.1994986	0.5028389	2.428288	0.4182251	0.6626704156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9892396	2.148901	0.9969219	0.32186766178	BB	0.8811052	0.9630325	1.372498	0.99708	0.9255736260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9767334	2.053984	0.9944756	0.6524763128978	BB	0.850426	0.9754487	1.132831	0.9796959	0.1920333156724	AB	0.9071881	0.4869514	2.746972	0.4069743	0.85380041283	AB	0.6426585	0.6091233	1.923152	0.4252251	0.830621644671	AA	0.8078112	0.003756814	3.348727	0	0.2706895240130	NC	0	0.4406936	2.312009	0.3713681	0.9530456239834	NC	0	0.2562836	3.284416	0.3558882	0.9549118248222	NC	0.1256188	0.5657541	0.6888829	0.3842277	0.9089206278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9777966	1.388595	1	0.7675042!sample_table_end
