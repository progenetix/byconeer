Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	AB	0.6828958	0.7047692	1.530464	0.456845	0.7411745142066	AB	0.9004461	0.4652743	0.8719254	0.4005968	0.918395684234	AA	0.8676848	0.009050089	1.45506	0	-0.2557726252381	BB	0.8262474	0.991104	0.5412984	1	-0.472455622860	NC	0.05519244	0.4850792	0.6734098	0.3872673	0.346586998390	BB	0.8797263	0.993104	1.401949	1	0.2842019138233	AB	0.7858002	0.6150673	1.549091	0.4301687	1.14943981607	AB	0.784545	0.4939432	0.1905716	0.5022483	-1.139135146488	AA	0.8135715	0.02062247	1.855739	0	0.3633275156630	AB	0.8742581	0.516233	3.134205	0.5316887	0.36642766178	BB	0.8811052	0.9553561	1.040078	0.9863818	0.5240677260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9776208	2.104656	0.9953141	0.6885982128978	AB	0.850426	0.683439	0.9543785	0.502008	-0.04852262156724	AB	0.9236776	0.5131758	2.50667	0.429796	0.71404111283	BB	0.8091115	0.9969057	1.844336	0.9989901	0.648304544671	AB	0.8078112	0.3486761	2.935471	0.4704168	0.2039269240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9854819	1.603515	1	0.6470307239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9889977	1.832773	1	0.9179966248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9844141	0.5189376	0.9903818	0.2325229278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9804943	1.471905	1	0.8486921!sample_table_end
