Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB,or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_ratio175921	NC	0.01123709	0.6454855	1.948184	0.4144056	1.128757142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9901065	0.9768451	1	0.989224184234	BB	0.8676848	0.994568	1.422314	1	0.1137617252381	AB	0.8261942	0.5814792	0.6208215	0.438987	-0.309251322860	AA	0.8808271	0.004800125	0.8518256	0	0.836569498390	AA	0.8797263	0.01146996	2.198554	0	0.620846138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9843964	1.730005	0.999923	1.16899681607	AA	0.784545	0.09862179	0.2663556	0.02801232	-0.8318442146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9603108	2.030207	1	0.5196033156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9916796	2.305063	0.9993218	0.42616076178	BB	0.8811052	0.9579751	1.28658	0.9900318	0.8313924260311	AB	0.7787865	0.3473653	3.412931	0.36823	0.8400891128978	AB	0.850426	0.6455418	1.34963	0.4707115	0.4688317156724	BB	0.9236776	0.9974762	2.232816	1	0.72564631283	AB	0.3082097	0.5833602	2.217382	0.4067699	1.04884644671	AA	0.8078112	0.002185366	3.459264	0	0.3170037240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9787056	1.805657	0.9954917	0.8152531239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9834811	1.845165	1	0.9206861248222	AA	0.8508317	0.06810346	0.5766122	0	0.9078966278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9833567	1.414364	1	0.7881219!sample_table_end
