Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9985354	1.877158	1	0.8122423142066	NC	0.005927511	0.2836516	1.27975	0.22488	1.5203384234	BB	0.8676848	0.9936192	1.414329	1	0.1048254252381	NC	0.01763525	0.4665541	0.6093934	0.331399	-0.300324522860	AA	0.8808271	0.005379292	1.071419	0	1.16727198390	AA	0.8697201	0.01018005	2.739888	0	0.9384248138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9850971	1.704803	1	1.14760381607	AA	0.784545	0.08349176	0.4297296	0.009856055	-0.1480687146488	NC	0	0.3814804	2.877071	0.3079698	0.9291233156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9931349	2.661162	1	0.6352546178	BB	0.8811052	0.9477033	1.392578	0.9757167	0.9437478260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9797232	2.236603	0.9973004	0.778605128978	BB	0.850426	0.9962379	1.341527	1	0.4354981156724	AA	0.2506771	0.009655236	3.164112	0	1.2053791283	BB	0.7724094	0.9982897	2.519922	1	1.09824344671	NC	0.09861221	0.1990936	5.532329	0.2660218	1.06347240130	BB	0.8949394	0.984202	1.79658	1	0.810467239834	BB	0.7002718	0.981694	1.863782	0.9994475	0.9328983248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9943361	0.776991	1	0.8080993278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9839584	1.477868	1	0.8508477!sample_table_end
