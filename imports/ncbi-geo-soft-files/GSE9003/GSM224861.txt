Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9970475	1.642678	1	0.6208463142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9889873	0.7949502	1	0.69213184234	BB	0.8676848	0.99282	1.302952	1	-0.01419373252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9773417	0.5577858	0.9936858	-0.431383122860	AA	0.8808271	0.01490004	0.7955799	0.004718114	0.734676598390	AA	0.8797263	0.0152691	2.203316	0	0.6239193138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9755889	1.495299	0.984227	0.96145281607	AB	0.784545	0.468904	0.2493826	0.4723567	-0.7634022146488	AB	0.8135715	0.5545302	2.105872	0.4651871	0.4479663156630	AB	0.8742581	0.4926491	3.227813	0.5084925	0.3879716178	BB	0.8811052	0.9574504	1.24571	0.9893007	0.7847252260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9798734	1.983686	0.9974423	0.6056422128978	BB	0.850426	0.992081	1.039217	1	0.06721383156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01199614	2.444053	0	0.83209211283	BB	0.8091115	0.9832667	1.794024	0.9749753	0.611743444671	AB	0.8078112	0.3191553	3.703137	0.4300785	0.5281117240130	BB	0.8949394	0.971048	1.767641	0.9861038	0.781101239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9809542	1.829159	0.998859	0.9049069248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9956076	0.5489168	1	0.3059249278305	AB	0.6793056	0.7261024	1.304894	0.4739255	0.9478957!sample_table_end
