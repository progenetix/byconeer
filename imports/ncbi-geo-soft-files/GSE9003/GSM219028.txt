Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	1	1.639315	1	0.6156989142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9861841	0.8604624	1	0.8068184234	BB	0.8676848	0.9929968	1.099758	1	-0.2586399252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9864574	0.4150985	1	-0.856174122860	AA	0.8808271	0.006752174	0.747339	0	0.647127798390	AA	0.8797263	0.0127567	2.075735	0	0.5378971138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9860652	1.465453	1	0.929036981607	AA	0.784545	0.1012428	0.3390754	0.03115758	-0.4824977146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9759855	1.744901	1	0.3069919156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9954142	2.255365	1	0.39945086178	AB	0.8653515	0.5189286	1.251836	0.4178591	0.7528945260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9829945	2.016443	1	0.632666128978	BB	0.850426	0.9920954	1.085469	1	0.1300354156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01320977	2.423045	0	0.81924231283	BB	0.8091115	0.998359	1.672648	1	0.506981644671	AB	0.8078112	0.3553093	3.142001	0.4794806	0.3044953240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9828098	1.730242	1	0.7555584239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9886262	1.821477	1	0.9086028248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9913444	0.5768538	1	0.3804422278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9896294	1.21348	1	0.5604795!sample_table_end
