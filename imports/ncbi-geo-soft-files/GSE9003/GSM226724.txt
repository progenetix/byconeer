Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9961871	1.503691	1	0.4939429142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9912027	0.9086052	1	0.884579184234	BB	0.8676848	0.9958139	1.548569	1	0.2375282252381	BB	0.8262474	0.988162	0.6093227	1	-0.30214722860	AA	0.8808271	0.005792069	0.9195536	0	0.946616598390	AA	0.8797263	0.01075587	2.500426	0	0.8064741138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9837929	1.573985	0.9988475	1.03283381607	AA	0.784545	0.08907501	0.3136117	0.01655604	-0.6001968146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9609436	1.982077	1	0.4852257156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9912415	2.210533	0.9988909	0.3651946178	NC	0	0.2904542	1.87214	0.203197	1.396558260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9772838	2.296024	0.9949957	0.8137857128978	BB	0.850426	0.9829604	1.244138	0.991984	0.3270744156724	NC	0	0.3165598	3.386304	0.2586913	1.2066531283	BB	0.8091115	0.9962142	2.103537	0.9977725	0.838189144671	AA	0.8078112	0.002317277	3.611515	0	0.3791881240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9868025	1.660862	1	0.6983229239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9819656	1.977457	0.9996635	1.018657248222	BB	0.8508317	0.992002	0.5849374	1	0.4000713278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9830702	1.367173	1	0.739468!sample_table_end
