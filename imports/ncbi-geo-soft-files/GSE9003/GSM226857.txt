Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	NC	0	0.5686482	1.488415	0.3594001	0.7931546142066	AB	0.9026175	0.6549596	0.712828	0.6054439	0.587155684234	BB	0.8676848	0.9903272	1.16449	0.9976898	-0.1784161252381	NC	0.0338796	0.4801277	0.4583941	0.344106	-0.715376522860	AA	0.8808271	0.004131558	0.7472003	0	0.647727798390	AA	0.8797263	0.01080421	1.917994	0	0.4238976138233	BB	0.8618885	0.988348	1.334555	1	0.793324881607	AA	0.784545	0.1072815	0.2450752	0.0384041	-0.948355146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9667454	1.772626	1	0.3262719156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9952064	2.175702	1	0.34730696178	BB	0.8811052	0.9657714	1.151882	1	0.6732592260311	AB	0.5751255	0.60139	2.579192	0.6398455	0.6225941128978	BB	0.850426	0.9823189	1.077713	0.9909346	0.1199148156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01229019	2.224935	0	0.69648351283	BB	0.8091115	1	1.72526	1	0.551260144671	AA	0.8078112	0.001650159	4.249497	0	0.6136476240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9906347	1.380128	1	0.4329286239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9876318	1.892762	1	0.9627174248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9923289	0.5143184	1	0.2142283278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9776571	1.187514	1	0.5419708!sample_table_end
