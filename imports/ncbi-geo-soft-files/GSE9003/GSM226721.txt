Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM700985!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804336!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804337!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9948801	1.703668	1	0.6750501142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9879343	0.8216841	1	0.740012384234	AB	0.8676848	0.5776138	1.527314	0.5696204	-0.1032841252381	NC	0.1433968	0.5119799	0.5001264	0.3739247	-0.599634822860	NC	0	0.4363192	0.8680106	0.3475949	0.727435598390	NC	0.2475507	0.3795867	2.243309	0.3643994	0.6452417138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9767646	1.532883	0.9863223	0.996891781607	AA	0.784545	0.08830085	0.3015683	0.01562705	-0.6570135146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9628072	1.775525	1	0.3271558156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9946678	2.363897	1	0.46630956178	BB	0.8811052	0.9547064	1.161742	0.9854765	0.683548260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9788238	2.471967	0.9964507	0.9219784128978	BB	0.850426	0.9880385	1.165683	1	0.2329855156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01510971	2.55082	0	0.89276441283	BB	0.8091115	0.9805437	1.918478	0.970181	0.709173644671	AB	0.8049603	0.2807722	3.221742	0.3776304	0.3130634240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9715061	1.938449	0.9866654	0.914385239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9714118	2.123072	0.9912686	1.107821248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9864265	0.5750613	0.993955	0.3793038278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9917784	1.434423	1	0.7995319!sample_table_end
