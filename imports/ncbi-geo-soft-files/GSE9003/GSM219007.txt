Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.8217206	0.9961134	2.304504	1	1.109946142066	AB	0.3923619	0.3913511	1.425737	0.3290773	1.64731184234	AB	0.855441	0.5245837	1.137567	0.5146171	-0.5643567252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9826153	0.5636135	1	-0.4155422860	NC	0.02524648	0.4691	1.06005	0.3742663	1.00593898390	AB	0.6058453	0.4085365	2.903039	0.3956168	1.01681138233	NC	0.02368817	0.5260855	2.082304	0.3602001	1.62584381607	AA	0.784545	0.07571756	0.9463918	0.0005268999	0.9877133146488	BB	0.5988838	0.9397144	2.977592	0.9986053	1.064444156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9871759	2.953833	0.9948921	0.77825256178	NC	0.1001639	0.4428249	2.155591	0.3463562	1.55762260311	BB	0.6537455	0.9673904	2.762702	0.9856483	1.070041128978	BB	0.850426	0.9790435	1.072943	0.9855766	0.1135918156724	NC	0	0.01162947	4.820202	0	1.8120291283	BB	0.8091115	1	2.227021	1	0.919560844671	AA	0.8078112	0.002780423	5.392388	0	0.9576669240130	BB	0.6137669	0.9753861	2.605161	0.9914222	1.342604239834	NC	0.2017643	0.9869346	2.737601	1	1.494247248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9908618	0.7642306	1	0.7865732278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9864575	1.873758	1	1.190617!sample_table_end
