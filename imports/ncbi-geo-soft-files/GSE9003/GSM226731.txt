Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9966856	1.654192	1	0.6311917142066	BB	0.9026175	0.9898401	0.8716067	1	0.824812584234	BB	0.8676848	0.9946221	1.281324	1	-0.03679609252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9840729	0.5791118	1	-0.376169722860	AA	0.8808271	0.009288627	0.7820795	0.0001525291	0.711840598390	AA	0.8797263	0.01373496	2.098118	0	0.553358138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9832864	1.486711	0.9979449	0.950696381607	AA	0.784545	0.06811298	0.4363764	0	-0.1323003146488	AB	0.8135715	0.5666161	2.223956	0.4761672	0.5245379156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9935212	2.385735	1	0.47812136178	BB	0.8811052	0.9587213	1.186663	0.9910718	0.7148969260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9763243	1.956522	0.9940891	0.5818992128978	BB	0.850426	0.9846905	1.156077	0.9948142	0.2211246156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01298733	2.460286	0	0.84131981283	BB	0.8091115	1	1.932401	1	0.714840244671	AA	0.8078112	0.001274931	3.875234	0	0.4805107240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9866259	1.601327	1	0.645579239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9876284	1.815306	1	0.9024329248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9866921	0.5637887	0.9944265	0.3505615278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9814519	1.455197	1	0.8312048!sample_table_end
