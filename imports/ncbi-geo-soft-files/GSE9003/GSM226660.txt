Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM700986!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804332!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804333!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9943097	1.592103	1	0.5777634142066	NC	0.02603017	0.3096428	1.284078	0.250026	1.51818284234	BB	0.8676848	0.9917738	1.501327	0.9991903	0.1893633252381	BB	0.8262474	0.9589569	0.6770774	0.9662392	-0.154726522860	AA	0.8808271	0.003674028	0.8677241	0	0.863620798390	NC	0.227675	0.6325453	1.859258	0.6344451	0.449329138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9814772	1.676591	0.9947206	1.12467881607	AA	0.784545	0.1023724	0.3806002	0.03251312	-0.3153555146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9449172	1.989755	1	0.4848249156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9897326	2.26673	0.9974068	0.39950466178	BB	0.8811052	0.9558964	1.249314	0.9871349	0.7886105260311	NC	0.1417659	0.2559671	3.582328	0.2546236	0.8549311128978	BB	0.850426	0.9982752	1.18666	1	0.258481156724	NC	0.003905535	0.3270174	3.112657	0.267792	1.0819071283	BB	0.8091115	0.9991205	2.079762	1	0.821079644671	AB	0.7859506	0.4697478	2.989784	0.5803963	0.334824240130	AB	0.8949394	0.6089402	2.161963	0.542178	0.9170651239834	AB	0.4736726	0.4222502	3.054415	0.5544462	1.06796248222	AB	0.8506941	0.77603	0.7321605	0.6203879	0.8789549278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9856768	1.369929	1	0.7396098!sample_table_end
