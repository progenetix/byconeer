Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM700984!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804318!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804319!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9986915	1.779341	1	0.7349194142066	NC	0.101518	0.3544889	1.023422	0.2934138	1.17881984234	AB	0.844564	0.6209966	1.57278	0.6146173	-0.03080649252381	NC	0.0794021	0.5000503	0.6565565	0.3627567	-0.20328522860	NC	0	0.4113896	0.9620513	0.3273116	0.883369498390	NC	0.04565005	0.3461642	2.190023	0.3283591	0.6109837138233	AB	0.8618885	0.6912076	1.66363	0.4900397	1.21118681607	AA	0.784545	0.09688351	0.3561656	0.02592637	-0.4133751146488	BB	0.8135715	0.9541191	1.760423	1	0.3115858156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9927235	2.179613	1	0.34674866178	AA	0.8811052	0.04639431	1.370228	0	1.016791260311	AB	0.3560989	0.3024826	3.839845	0.3124416	0.9828329128978	BB	0.850426	0.9738654	1.16653	0.9771059	0.234361156724	AB	0.9236776	0.5898462	2.504926	0.4965182	0.69078911283	BB	0.8091115	0.9953424	1.797428	0.9962376	0.611519844671	AB	0.8078112	0.3995587	3.130546	0.5236386	0.3325158240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9836349	1.727369	1	0.7535336239834	BB	0.7002718	0.9876122	1.79236	1	0.88406248222	NC	0	0.4374122	0.7762718	0.2799378	1.142941278305	BB	0.6793056	0.987258	1.558481	1	0.9239764!sample_table_end
