Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM700987!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804322!Sample_relation = Affiliated with: GSM804323!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9974558	1.783327	1	0.7390645142066	AB	0.9026175	0.5267653	1.096401	0.4600882	1.23288684234	BB	0.8676848	0.9917182	1.391449	0.9991326	0.07966563252381	AB	0.8262474	0.6502159	0.6265255	0.505319	-0.315380922860	AA	0.8808271	0.006930565	0.9422436	0	0.981405998390	AA	0.8797263	0.01624917	2.02696	0	0.503548138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9769976	1.481746	0.9867375	0.947868581607	AA	0.784545	0.09033623	0.4873062	0.01806952	0.03617733146488	AB	0.8135715	0.5756012	2.145253	0.4843303	0.47097156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9890286	2.256155	0.9967144	0.39186856178	AB	0.4267811	0.4729578	1.580491	0.3746674	1.101682260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9816027	2.020907	0.9990762	0.6343419128978	BB	0.850426	0.9719296	1.203462	0.9739391	0.2793716156724	AA	0.9236776	0.01659941	2.29809	0	0.74175411283	BB	0.8091115	0.9992632	1.891565	1	0.684206944671	AA	0.8078112	0.002993432	3.104886	0	0.1613558240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9829994	1.707253	1	0.7363467239834	BB	0.7002718	0.982205	1.762045	0.999854	0.8525651248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9942664	0.6826563	1	0.6214084278305	BB	0.6793056	0.9842971	1.402608	1	0.7750826!sample_table_end
