Briefly, 750 ng of genomic DNA were amplified at 37Â°C overnight, using solutions WG-AMM and WG-MP1. After overnight incubation, the amplified DNA was fragmented using WG-FRG and precipitated with isopropanol after the addition of WG-PA1.!Sample_hyb_protocol = The dried precipitated pellet was then resuspended in WG-RA1 and hybridized to a beadchip along with WG-RA1 and formamide. The arrays were then incubated overnight at 48Â°C, after which they underwent single-base extension on a Teflow chamber rack system (Tecan, MÃ¤nnedorf, Switzerland) using WG-XC1, WG-XC2, and WG-TEM.!Sample_scan_protocol = After the single-base extension step, the beadchips were stained with WG-LTM and WG-ATM, dried for 1 h, then imaged using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina).!Sample_description = The 76 melanoma cell lines used in this study were derived from primary cutaneous melanomas or melanoma metastases.!Sample_data_processing = Image data was analyzed using Beadstudio 2.0 (Illumina). All genomic positions were based upon hg17 from the UCSC Genome Browser.!Sample_platform_id = GPL5711!Sample_contact_name = Mitchell,,Stark!Sample_contact_email = mitchelS@qimr.edu.au!Sample_contact_institute = QIMR!Sample_contact_address = 300 Herston Rd Herston!Sample_contact_city = Brisbane!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 4006!Sample_contact_country = Australia!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE9003!Sample_data_row_count = 317503#ID_REF = #VALUE = Genotype: AA,AB,BB, or NC (no call)#Confidence_Score = Beadstudio confidence score#Theta = Beadstudio genotype metric#R = Beadstudio intensity metric#B_Allele_Freq = Beadstudio estimate of B allele frequency#Log_R_Ratio = Beadstudio metric for signal intensity!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE	Confidence_Score	Theta	R	B_Allele_Freq	Log_R_Ratio175921	BB	0.825021	0.9959539	1.855859	1	0.7976953142066	AB	0.9026175	0.476804	1.140309	0.4117516	1.30252984234	BB	0.8676848	0.9941804	1.611932	1	0.2939803252381	AB	0.7967197	0.5680494	0.6572555	0.4264145	-0.222845322860	AA	0.8808271	0.007094566	0.9199722	0	0.946841798390	AA	0.8797263	0.01096969	2.565946	0	0.8437886138233	BB	0.8618885	0.9829327	1.793522	0.9973145	1.2214881607	AA	0.784545	0.09640452	0.3596131	0.02535156	-0.3996774146488	AB	0.8135715	0.5652472	2.602619	0.4749236	0.7516162156630	BB	0.8742581	0.9897667	2.351375	0.9974403	0.45243976178	AB	0.8791766	0.527178	1.724301	0.4256098	1.212636260311	BB	0.7870646	0.9813119	2.481618	0.9988014	0.9303035128978	AB	0.8489023	0.61692	1.452262	0.447851	0.5882934156724	AB	0.5959355	0.460216	3.226116	0.3837078	1.0936381283	BB	0.8091115	0.9981542	2.126743	1	0.853542944671	AB	0.8078112	0.342098	3.666319	0.4614282	0.5222154240130	BB	0.8949394	0.9777329	1.820105	0.9942992	0.8263119239834	BB	0.6998481	0.9873492	2.190689	1	1.173248248222	BB	0.8508317	0.9801804	0.6533742	0.9828648	0.5677656278305	BB	0.6793056	0.987415	1.449891	1	0.8196141!sample_table_end
