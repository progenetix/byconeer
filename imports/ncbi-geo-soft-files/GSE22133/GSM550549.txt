Quantified intensities for tumor sample were stored as channel 1 (ch1) whereas quantified intensities for reference sample were stored as channel 2 (ch2). Median spot pixel values were used to calculate background corrected intensities (Int1 and Int2). Spots were removed and regarded as missing values if either: (1) flagged during image-analysis, (2) background corrected intensity value >64999 signal units, (3) background corrected intensity value <0 signal units, or (4) Signal to noise ratio <5 in either Int1 or Int2 channel. For spots, log ratio (M) was calculated as log2(Int1/Int2) and average intensity (A) was calculated as log10(Int1*Int2)/2. Normalization was performed by applying popLowess (PMID: 17953745). Spots from dye-swap hybridization were merged using geometric mean of ratios after normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7247!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM550nnn/GSM550549/suppl/GSM550549_TAX577047_Cy3_1.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE22133!Sample_data_row_count = 29864#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference male DNA)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE28065	0.31503374823532	0.06915518814459	-0.15499579627309	0.2368496428491	-0.2717425219769	-0.0915575914081	0.32772334420900	0.05736709833192	0.34528955734676	-0.13815068418070	-0.1528427175213	-0.62938138414336	-0.456385196293	0.1389811281050	0.3083236313404	0.09895904724746	0.0583147843583	0.18313064211717	-0.113255376911	-0.043465574!sample_table_end
