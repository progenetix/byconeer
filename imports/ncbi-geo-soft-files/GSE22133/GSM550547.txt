Quantified intensities for tumor sample were stored as channel 1 (ch1) whereas quantified intensities for reference sample were stored as channel 2 (ch2). Median spot pixel values were used to calculate background corrected intensities (Int1 and Int2). Spots were removed and regarded as missing values if either: (1) flagged during image-analysis, (2) background corrected intensity value >64999 signal units, (3) background corrected intensity value <0 signal units, or (4) Signal to noise ratio <5 in either Int1 or Int2 channel. For spots, log ratio (M) was calculated as log2(Int1/Int2) and average intensity (A) was calculated as log10(Int1*Int2)/2. Normalization was performed by applying popLowess (PMID: 17953745). Spots from dye-swap hybridization were merged using geometric mean of ratios after normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL7247!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM550nnn/GSM550547/suppl/GSM550547_TAX577290_Cy3_1.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE22133!Sample_data_row_count = 29864#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference male DNA)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE28065	-0.01164756923532	0.01310381614459	-0.08290814627309	0.1099363088491	null19769	-0.5575347814081	0.10753472920900	0.06648335733192	-0.35087452634676	-0.01642850318070	-0.1374454455213	0.20794918514336	-0.066221029293	0.1403663381050	0.14067558713404	0.07643631724746	0.1176948083583	-0.00505410411717	0.092435041911	0.02065857!sample_table_end
