Quantified intensities for tumor sample were stored as channel 1 (ch1) whereas quantified intensities for reference sample were stored as channel 2 (ch2). Median spot pixel values were used to calculate background corrected intensities (Int1 and Int2). Spots were removed and regarded as missing values if either: (1) flagged during image-analysis, (2) background corrected intensity value >64999 signal units, (3) background corrected intensity value <0 signal units, or (4) Signal to noise ratio <5 in either Int1 or Int2 channel. For spots, log ratio (M) was calculated as log2(Int1/Int2) and average intensity (A) was calculated as log10(Int1*Int2)/2. Normalization was performed by applying popLowess (PMID: 17953745). Spots from dye-swap hybridization were merged using geometric mean of ratios after normalization.!Sample_platform_id = GPL4723!Sample_contact_name = Johan,,Staaf!Sample_contact_institute = SCIBLU - Swegene Centre for Integrative Biology at Lund University!Sample_contact_address = Medicon Village!Sample_contact_city = Lund!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = SE-223 81!Sample_contact_country = Sweden!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM551nnn/GSM551487/suppl/GSM551487_TAX577352_Cy3_1.gpr.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE22133!Sample_data_row_count = 30120#ID_REF = #VALUE = Normalized log2 ratio (tumor/reference male DNA)!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	0.41862	0.02923	0.1324	-0.20135	-0.42426	-0.34647	-0.35568	0.35289	-0.519510	0.129611	-0.387812	0.096313	0.098714	0.411315	0.536316	0.439117	0.050618	-0.33819	-0.294720	-0.0368!sample_table_end
