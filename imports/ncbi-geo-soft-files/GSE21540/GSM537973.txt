Systematic biases were removed from Log2 ratios (Cy3/Cy5) using CGHNorm (BMC Bioinformatics. 2005 Nov 18;6:274).  Only clones with SD<=0.075 and SNR>3 (for both channels) were used for further work.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2616!Sample_contact_name = Raj,,Chari!Sample_contact_email = rchari@bccrc.ca!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wan Lam Lab!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Genetics and Developmental Biology!Sample_contact_institute = BC Cancer Research Centre!Sample_contact_address = 675 West 10th Avenue!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_state = BC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V5Z 1L3!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM537nnn/GSM537973/suppl/GSM537973_HCC1937.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21540!Sample_series_id = GSE21541!Sample_data_row_count = 53856#ID_REF = #VALUE = CGHnorm normalized log2 test/reference ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	0.2051742	0.7355283	-0.2899964	0.4302575	0.7617146	0.1600317	0.0167028	0.1439319	-0.0338110	-0.38665611	0.0784812	-0.24016313	0.04994714	1.08184615	0.1844516	0.46180917	-1.05991118	0.0275819	0.48919920	0.230476!sample_table_end
