Systematic biases were removed from Log2 ratios (Cy3/Cy5) using CGHNorm (BMC Bioinformatics. 2005 Nov 18;6:274).  Only clones with SD<=0.075 and SNR>3 (for both channels) were used for further work.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2616!Sample_contact_name = Raj,,Chari!Sample_contact_email = rchari@bccrc.ca!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wan Lam Lab!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Genetics and Developmental Biology!Sample_contact_institute = BC Cancer Research Centre!Sample_contact_address = 675 West 10th Avenue!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_state = BC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V5Z 1L3!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM537nnn/GSM537974/suppl/GSM537974_HCC2218.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21540!Sample_series_id = GSE21541!Sample_data_row_count = 53856#ID_REF = #VALUE = CGHnorm normalized log2 test/reference ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	0.0718122	-0.1511023	-0.0204574	0.0352215	0.0115536	0.0938327	-0.0881178	0.0354859	0.09580410	-0.04479911	0.02666912	0.02920613	-0.06538914	0.53269615	-0.08015616	-0.33465117	0.01601618	0.02376519	0.11527620	0.1243!sample_table_end
