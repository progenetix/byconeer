Systematic biases were removed from Log2 ratios (Cy3/Cy5) using CGHNorm (BMC Bioinformatics. 2005 Nov 18;6:274).  Only clones with SD<=0.075 and SNR>3 (for both channels) were used for further work.!Sample_platform_id = GPL2616!Sample_contact_name = Raj,,Chari!Sample_contact_email = rchari@bccrc.ca!Sample_contact_laboratory = Wan Lam Lab!Sample_contact_department = Cancer Genetics and Developmental Biology!Sample_contact_institute = BC Cancer Research Centre!Sample_contact_address = 675 West 10th Avenue!Sample_contact_city = Vancouver!Sample_contact_state = BC!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = V5Z 1L3!Sample_contact_country = Canada!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM537nnn/GSM537968/suppl/GSM537968_HCC38.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE21540!Sample_series_id = GSE21541!Sample_data_row_count = 53856#ID_REF = #VALUE = CGHnorm normalized log2 test/reference ratio!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUE1	-0.0664892	1.0226053	0.0604764	-0.4421865	0.1287926	0.032017	-0.3625248	-0.0903479	0.08148110	0.36662111	-0.14555212	-0.95811213	-0.36637414	-0.55459415	0.0450516	0.00860417	0.46039218	0.00395419	0.05617220	0.244457!sample_table_end
