The log2ratio of Cy5 (tumor) to Cy3 (Control) was normalized by the Centralization Algorithm in DNA Analytics. Aberrant regions were determined by the ADM-2 algorithm at a threshold of 12.0 in DNA Analytics. To detect gains and losses, we set the values of parameters for aberration filters as: minimum number of probes in region 2, minimum absolute average log2ratio for region 0.263034, maximum number of aberrant regions 10000, and percentage penetrance per feature 0. We set the value of the minimum absolute average log2ratio at 0.263034 to detect regions showing a change in the averaged copy number equal to or more than 1.2-fold (log2(1.2)=0.263034).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8841!Sample_contact_name = Toru,,Inoue!Sample_contact_email = i-toru@med.oita-u.ac.jp!Sample_contact_fax = +81-97-586-5699!Sample_contact_department = Department of Molecular Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Faculty of medicineOita University!Sample_contact_address = Hasama-machi 1-1!Sample_contact_city = Yufu-City, Oita!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 879-5593!Sample_contact_country = Japan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM820nnn/GSM820352/suppl/GSM820352_E1_sim-cys_US45102856_251495025193_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07_1_1.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33117!Sample_data_row_count = 42416#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2ratio of Cy5 (tumor) to Cy3 (Control)  by the Centralization Algorithm in DNA Analytics!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_14_P112718	-0.31293482A_14_P201353	0.53105533A_14_P108353	0.09801036A_14_P129881	-0.6626176A_14_P114030	0.124671966A_14_P139527	0.021558093A_14_P118340	-0.10658791A_14_P106890	-0.0910929A_14_P122641	-0.21273664A_14_P107170	-0.4017596A_14_P100766	-0.3271673A_14_P118104	-0.22101311A_14_P117253	-0.38673064A_14_P129407	-0.31416476A_14_P200001	-0.44407853A_14_P103811	-0.064900585A_14_P119666	0.5866515A_14_P100799	-0.08609291A_14_P121179	-0.08070183A_14_P115318	-0.109651774!sample_table_end
