The log2ratio of Cy5 (tumor) to Cy3 (Control) was normalized by the Centralization Algorithm in DNA Analytics. Aberrant regions were determined by the ADM-2 algorithm at a threshold of 12.0 in DNA Analytics. To detect gains and losses, we set the values of parameters for aberration filters as: minimum number of probes in region 2, minimum absolute average log2ratio for region 0.263034, maximum number of aberrant regions 10000, and percentage penetrance per feature 0. We set the value of the minimum absolute average log2ratio at 0.263034 to detect regions showing a change in the averaged copy number equal to or more than 1.2-fold (log2(1.2)=0.263034).!Sample_platform_id = GPL8841!Sample_contact_name = Toru,,Inoue!Sample_contact_email = i-toru@med.oita-u.ac.jp!Sample_contact_fax = +81-97-586-5699!Sample_contact_department = Department of Molecular Pathology!Sample_contact_institute = Faculty of medicineOita University!Sample_contact_address = Hasama-machi 1-1!Sample_contact_city = Yufu-City, Oita!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 879-5593!Sample_contact_country = Japan!Sample_supplementary_file = ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM820nnn/GSM820363/suppl/GSM820363_E54_aty-cys_US45102856_251495025194_S01_CGH-v4_95_Feb07_1_3.txt.gz!Sample_series_id = GSE33117!Sample_data_row_count = 42416#ID_REF = #VALUE = normalized log2ratio of Cy5 (tumor) to Cy3 (Control)  by the Centralization Algorithm in DNA Analytics!sample_table_beginID_REF	VALUEA_14_P112718	-1.6673818A_14_P201353	-0.0334664A_14_P108353	-0.36647505A_14_P129881	-1.2481169A_14_P114030	-0.2563182A_14_P139527	1.8012185A_14_P118340	1.6530825A_14_P106890	0.09353173A_14_P122641	0.4536405A_14_P107170	0.88955927A_14_P100766	0.92171884A_14_P118104	-1.1417228A_14_P117253	-0.22090536A_14_P129407	1.3087169A_14_P200001	0.29606903A_14_P103811	-0.031148553A_14_P119666	0.55599254A_14_P100799	-1.4283568A_14_P121179	0.047907352A_14_P115318	1.0222596!sample_table_end
