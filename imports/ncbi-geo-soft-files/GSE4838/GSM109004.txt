Detailed protocols are available at our website!Sample_scan_protocol = Slides were scanned using an Axon 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA)!Sample_description = see Ullmann et al (submitted)!Sample_data_processing = TIFF images were analysed by Genepix 5.0 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and raw intensities (gpr files) were imported into CGHPRO (Chen et al., 2005). Background intensities were not subtracted. Signal intensities were normalized by subgrid LOWESS and chromosomal regions sharing the same DNA copy number were segmented by circular binary segmentation. Segments exceeding a log2 ratio of +/- 0.2 were considered as an aberration.!Sample_platform_id = GPL3749!Sample_contact_name = Reinhard,,Ullmann!Sample_contact_email = ullmann@molgen.mpg.de!Sample_contact_phone = 00493084131251!Sample_contact_laboratory = Molecular Cytogenetics!Sample_contact_department = Human Molecular Genetics!Sample_contact_institute = MPIMG!Sample_contact_address = Ihnestr.73!Sample_contact_city = Berlin!Sample_contact_zip/postal_code = 14195!Sample_contact_country = Germany!Sample_supplementary_file = NONE!Sample_series_id = GSE4838!Sample_data_row_count = 37225
