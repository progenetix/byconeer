Specifically, 20 Âµl 2.5X Random Primer Mix was combined with 10 Âµg DNA in 21 Âµl nuclease free water and heat-denatured.  To the cooled DNA was added: 5 Âµl of nucleotide mix (1.2 mM each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and 0.6 mM dTTP), 3 nmol of appropriate labelled nucleotide (test DNA and reference DNA labeled with Cy5-dUTP and Cy3-dUTP respectively), and 1 Âµl Exo- Klenow.  Reaction was incubated at 37Â°C for 2 hrs, acidified with 10 Âµl 3 M Sodium Acetate (pH 5.2), and purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA).!Sample_source_name_ch2 = Amplified normal male DNA (Promega)!Sample_organism_ch2 = Homo sapiens!Sample_taxid_ch2 = 9606!Sample_characteristics_ch2 = sample type: Reference DNA!Sample_molecule_ch2 = genomic DNA!Sample_extract_protocol_ch2 = DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions.
